[1]  The Conclusion of the New Testament #114-134 CONTENTS
[2]  In the foregoing messages on the believers we have covered the believers status, designations, and symbols.
[3]  Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God, Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God, and Hebrews 1:3 reveals that Christ is the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance.
[4]  Let us now go on to consider the believers life in the second stage in the stage of the fall.
[5]  In the fall our life is a life of sin.
[6]  Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
[7]  This reveals that the believers life in God s salvation is a life freed from the law of sin and death by the law of the Spirit of life.
[8]  Life is the content and the issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit who is life to the believers in Christ.
[9]  Furthermore, the life of the believers in God s salvation is a life uplifted in Christ s resurrection and transformed by the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit.
[10]  To say that Adam was a son of God does not mean that he was born of God and possessed the life and nature of God.
[11]  Whereas in God s creation we have a good human nature, in the fall we have a fallen human nature.
[12]  As originally created by God, the human body was a pure vessel containing one element, the element created by God.
[13]  We praise the Lord that, as believers in Christ, we have been brought into a third stage the stage of God s salvation.
[14]  The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God s new creation to make us a new man.
[15]  The Holy Spirit washes and renews us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature to be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God.
[16]  God chose us according to His infinite foresight before He created us.
[17]  This indicates that the universe was founded for man s existence to fulfill God s eternal purpose.
[18]  In love in Ephesians 1:4 may modify having predestinated in verse 5.
[19]  The divine love is His motive to have many sons for the fulfillment of His divine economy.
[20]  We shall begin with the initial stage of God s full salvation, the stage of regeneration.
[21]  Second Timothy 1:9 and 10 tell us that God called us also according to His grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.
[22]  First Peter 5:10 tells us that God has called us in Christ.
[23]  Apart from Christ, or outside of Christ, God will not do anything concerning us.
[24]  Whatever God does with us, He does in Christ, that is, in Christ as the sphere and element.
[25]  Christ is the sphere and element in which the believers have been called by God.
[26]  The heavenly calling is also a calling worthy of the walk in the church, the Body of Christ, with the Triune God s reality, which is the unsearchable riches and the immeasurable dimensions of Christ unto all the fullness of God for God s expression Eph 4:1; 3:21, 8b, 18, 19b; 4:2-6 .
[27]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of God s calling of the believers.
[28]  We have seen that we have been called into God s marvelous light and into the fellowship of God s Son.
[29]  Now we need to see that we have also been called to the suffering of Christ.
[30]  If doing good and suffering you shall endure, this is grace with God.
[31]  Our destiny in God s calling includes both the enjoyment of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God and also the suffering of Christ.
[32]  He has also called us unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[33]  In eternity God chose us unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, and then in time He called us unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord.
[34]  It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain unto His glorious goal.
[35]  When we connect Acts 26:18a with Luke 15:8, we see that the enlightening of the Holy Spirit is to open people s eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.
[36]  To repent before God is, on the negative side, to repent not only of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption that usurp and corrupt people whom God made for Himself and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past.
[37]  Repentance works in us in such a profound way that God gives us the forgiveness of sins, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the divine inheritance.
[38]  Acts 2:38 says, Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[39]  The gift of the Holy Spirit is not any gift distributed by the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 12:6, 1 Corinthians 12:4, and 1 Peter 4:10; rather, it is the gift which is the Holy Spirit Himself, given by God to the believers in Christ as the unique gift that produces all the gifts mentioned in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and 1 Peter 4.
[40]  The Holy Spirit in Acts 2:38 is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God in His New Testament economy, both essential for life and economical for power, given to the believers at the time of their repentance and believing in Christ Eph 1:13; Gal 3:2 as the all-inclusive blessing of God s full gospel Gal 3:14 , so that they may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God 2 Cor 13:14 .
[41]  Regarding the believers present, we have seen God s calling, the Spirit s separation, and our repentance.
[42]  We have believed into Christ Jesus to be justified with the righteousness of God.
[43]  Justification is God s action in approving us according to the standard of His righteousness.
[44]  We may justify ourselves according to our standard of righteousness, but this does not enable us to be justified by God according to His standard.
[45]  Galatians 2:16 says, Knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus; we also have believed in Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by works of law, because by works of law no flesh shall be justified.
[46]  and the Stand On, the Lord Jesus to Be Saved
[47]  This indicates that we believe not only into Christ but also on Christ.
[48]  This is to take the ground and the standing on the person of Christ and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the belief, the faith, of God s New Testament economy.
[49]  The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God Eph 1:8-9; Acts 2:23; Rom 1:2; 2 Cor 5:21; Acts 3:15 , and it is the power of God unto salvation to all believers Rom 1:16 , that they may be reconciled to God 2 Cor 5:19 and regenerated by Him 1 Pet 1:3 to be His children John 1:12-13; Rom 8:16 and enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance Eph 1:14 .
[50]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 5
[51]  In the foregoing message we covered several aspects of believing.
[52]  We have seen that, as believers, we have received Him who is the Word, the very God, and the true light, believing into His name; that we have believed into the Son of God and the Son of Man to have an organic union with Him; that we have believed into Christ Jesus to be justified with the righteousness of God; that we have believed on the Lord Jesus to be saved; that our believing in Christ is through the hearing of the Word; and that we have believed in the gospel.
[53]  Our believing is a gift given to us by God.
[54]  This means that faith is something initiated by God, formed by Him, and given to us by Him.
[55]  to All the Believers as a Common Precious Portion
[56]  The God-given faith is allotted to all believers as a common precious portion 2 Pet 1:1 .
[57]  The faith given to us by God is the portion of our inheritance allotted to us by God.
[58]  As long as we have this gift, we have the lot of God s inheritance, for living faith equals the lot of God s inheritance.
[59]  outside of Israel through the Angels and Moses Was the Key to God s Old Testament Dispensation The precious faith given by God within us through the Spirit as the power and Christ as the element is the key to receive God s New Testament economy, as the law given by God outside of Israel through the angels and Moses Gal 3:19 was the key to God s Old Testament dispensation Gal 3:23, 26 .
[60]  To believe is to receive Christ not only for forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 but also for regeneration 1 Pet 1:21, 23 , so that those who believe may become the children of God John 1:12-13 and the members of Christ Eph 5:30 in an organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 .
[61]  of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[62]  To be baptized is to be baptized into the name denoting the person of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into an organic union with the processed Triune God.
[63]  Now, after the Lord Jesus accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God.
[64]  Then, based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts Acts 2:38 , not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the death of Christ Rom 6:3-4 , into Christ Himself Gal 3:27 , into the Triune God Matt 28:19 , and into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13 .
[65]  Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, since Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and since the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ.
[66]  According to the book of Acts, the believers are baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, who is the all-inclusive embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[67]  This indicates that to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit because the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .
[68]  In this message we shall continue to see the significance of the believers being baptized.
[69]  The believers have been baptized into Christ to put on Christ, to enter into the organic union with Christ.
[70]  In Romans 6:3 Paul says, Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
[71]  Here we see that when we were baptized into Christ Jesus, we were also baptized into the death of Christ.
[72]  On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ s person; on the other hand, we have been baptized into Christ s death.
[73]  The New Testament reveals that the believers are baptized with or in both water and the Holy Spirit.
[74]  In Acts 1:5 the Lord Jesus says, John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
[75]  This indicates that baptism as an appeal to God for a good conscience is through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life, without whom as the reality baptism by water is only an empty and dead ritual.
[76]  We have seen that, concerning their present, the believers have been called by God, they have been separated unto God by the Spirit, they have repented, they have believed, and they have been baptized.
[77]  Now we need to see that the believers have been joined to the processed Triune God.
[78]  John 1:13 speaks of the believers as those who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
[79]  This verse clearly tells us that we have been born of God.
[80]  When we were born of God to become His children, we were not born of our physical life, our fallen life, or our created life we were born of God, the uncreated life.
[81]  God brought us forth, regenerated us, of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose, so that we might be the firstfruit of His creatures.
[82]  God s shining Christ into our hearts results in the illumination of knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ, that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ.
[83]  The believers are joined to God the Son by having the Son revealed in them Gal 1:16a .
[84]  God s heart s desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life John 17:3; 3:16 , and become the sons of God John 1:12; Gal 4:5-6 .
[85]  This indicates that to reveal the Son of God brings pleasure to God.
[86]  Nothing is more pleasing to God than the unveiling, the revelation, of the living person of the Son of God.
[87]  It is significant that in Galatians 1:15 and 16 Paul does not say that God revealed Christ in him, but says that He revealed His Son in him.
[88]  Hence, when Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him, this means that the One revealed in him was the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the processed all-inclusive Spirit.
[89]  Having been identified with Christ in His death, we have also been identified with Him in His burial.
[90]  In Romans 6:4a Paul tells us, We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism.
[91]  Also, Colossians 2:12a reveals that we have been buried together with Christ in baptism.
[92]  Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas being made alive enables us, as the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him.
[93]  God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself Col 3:4 , into our deadened spirit through His Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .
[94]  The believers, as partners of Christ sharing His anointing Heb 1:9b , have been attached to Him as God s anointed One by God.
[95]  Second Corinthians 1:21a speaks of He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ.
[96]  This means that God attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, connecting the apostles and the believers to Christ, the anointed One.
[97]  Regarding the believers being joined to God the Son we have seen eleven matters: God having shined Him into our hearts; our having received Him; having Him revealed in us; having been baptized into Christ; having put on Christ; having been put in Christ by God; identified with Christ in His death, burial, being made alive, resurrection, and ascension; grafted into Christ as the reality of the cultivated olive tree; attached to Christ as God s anointed One by God; joined to the Lord as one spirit; and loving Him and exulting in Him with unspeakable and glorified joy.
[98]  In this message we shall continue to see how the believers, in the initial stage of God s full salvation, are joined to the processed Triune God.
[99]  We have seen that, as believers, we have been joined to God the Father as the source of the divine Trinity and to God the Son, Christ, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[100]  Now we need to see that we have also been joined to God the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.
[101]  The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for the Spirit contains the element of the divine life.
[102]  Therefore, with the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.
[103]  The Spirit within us essentially is the firstfruit as the foretaste of the processed Triune God.
[104]  Romans 8:23 says, We ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.
[105]  The processed Triune God is the full taste, and He has given us the Spirit as the firstfruit to be our foretaste.
[106]  The same Spirit who was breathed into the believers essentially as life in Christ s resurrection was poured out upon them economically by Christ in His ascension.
[107]  In and after His ascension Christ received the all-inclusive Spirit from the Father economically and poured Him out upon the disciples for their ministry and work.
[108]  First Corinthians 6:20a says, You were bought with a price.
[109]  He who was called in the Lord when a slave is the Lord s freedman; likewise, he who was called when free is Christ s slave.
[110]  We, God s redeemed ones, the church, are God s possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ Acts 20:28 .
[111]  Being forgiven of our sins means having our sins forgotten by God in His new covenant.
[112]  Then in verses 10 and 11 three crucial aspects of the new covenant are mentioned: the imparting of the law of life, the blessing of having God and of being His people, and the inward ability of knowing the Lord.
[113]  3 By the Believers Repentance and Faith in Christ
[114]  Acts 2:38 speaks of repentance, and Acts 10:43 says, To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.
[115]  In the foregoing message we saw that the believers have been redeemed by being bought and by being forgiven of their sins.
[116]  In this message we shall see that the believers have been redeemed by being freed, washed, and sanctified.
[117]  Having now been justified in His blood, we shall be saved through Him from the wrath Rom 5:9 .
[118]  In John 3:36 the Lord Jesus says, He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.
[119]  Furthermore, in 1 Thessalonians 1:10 Paul tells us, To wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from among the dead Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.
[120]  Although we have been washed positionally by the blood of Christ before God and in our conscience, we still need the second aspect of God s washing.
[121]  Because God forgives us, our conscience also releases us through the outward washing of Christ s blood.
[122]  In Greek the word rendered sanctified is actually a verbal form of the word for holiness.
[123]  Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.
[124]  In this message we shall see that, as redeemed ones, the believers have been justified and then reconciled to God in the first step.
[125]  Because we have been bought, forgiven, freed, washed, and sanctified, we have no problems before God.
[126]  Romans 3:22 speaks of the faith of Jesus Christ, and verse 26, of the faith of Jesus.
[127]  Some Bible students say that the faith of Jesus Christ refers to our act of believing in Jesus Christ, and others claim that this refers to the faith of Jesus, that the faith of Jesus becomes ours.
[128]  But if we take God s word, stand on it, and obey it, and if we believe in His Son Jesus Christ, God will count our believing in His Son according to His word as righteousness.
[129]  The believers being justified by God is also evidenced by the ascension of Christ.
[130]  In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will convince the world concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father.
[131]  This indicates that the Father has been fully satisfied with the Lord s redemptive death and has accepted Him in His resurrection.
[132]  The proof that the Father is satisfied with Christ s redemption is that the Father resurrected Him from among the dead and exalted Him to His right hand.
[133]  Hence, the resurrection and ascension of Christ are the evidences proving that His redemption has satisfied God and has met all the demands and requirements of God for our justification.
[134]  c In the Name Person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[135]  First Corinthians 6:11 reveals that we are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[136]  This is not justification by Christ s blood in an objective way but subjective justification in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in the organic union with Him through faith.
[137]  Paul in Romans 5:10 tells us that we were reconciled through the death of God s Son, and in Colossians 1:20 we see that this reconciliation was through the blood of His cross.
[138]  The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins Heb 9:28 , not only for our redemption but also for God s satisfaction.
[139]  The new creation is the new man in Christ Eph 4:24 , our being regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , having God s life and the divine nature wrought into us, with Christ as its constituent Col 3:10-11 .
[140]  Regeneration causes us to become a new creation, something which has the element of God within it.
[141]  Originally, we did not have God s element; therefore, we were the old creation.
[142]  First Peter 1:3 reveals that our regeneration took place through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.
[143]  It is crucial for us to realize that we were regenerated when Christ was resurrected.
[144]  5 Of the Spirit to Generate the New Man
[145]  The believers in Christ have been regenerated of the Spirit to generate the new man.
[146]  John 3:5 says, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[147]  Here we see that regeneration requires two elements water and Spirit.
[148]  The believers in Christ have been regenerated to receive the eternal life the divine life as the seed of God John 3:15-16; 1 John 5:11-13; 3:9 .
[149]  The Spirit received by the believers is also the pledge within them of the divine inheritance Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22; 5:5 .
[150]  The pledge of the Spirit, which is actually the Spirit Himself as the pledge, is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us.
[151]  Thus, the Spirit within us is the pledge of God being our portion in Christ.
[152]  God gives the Spirit to us not only as a pledge of our inheritance but also a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.
[153]  We have seen that the believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated and by receiving the Spirit of God.
[154]  Now we must go on to see that the believers have been made a new creation also by having the eternal life.
[155]  Eternal life is the life of God, and the life of God was from the beginning: That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life 1 John 1:1 .
[156]  Eternal life is the free gift of God in Christ.
[157]  Therefore, the divine life has been given to us as the free gift of God in Christ.
[158]  In the two preceding messages we have seen that the believers are made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Spirit of God, and by having the eternal life.
[159]  It is through the death of Christ that the believers have been created into one new man.
[160]  Christ s death on the cross was not only for the accomplishment of redemption but also for the creation of the one new man.
[161]  In order to create the new man, it was necessary for Christ to abolish through His cross the ordinances, the different ways of living and worshipping.
[162]  In His flesh, which was typified by the separating veil in the temple, which was rent Heb 10:20 , Christ terminated the negative things so that in Himself as the essence the one new man might be created.
[163]  As believers in Christ, we have also been transferred out of darkness into light.
[164]  Acts 26:18 speaks of being turned from darkness to light, and 1 Peter 2:9, of being called out of darkness into God s marvelous light.
[165]  The believers have also been transferred out of Adam into Christ 1 Cor 15:22; Rom 5:12, 17, 19 .
[166]  In the sight of God, there are only two men in the universe: Adam and Christ.
[167]  All men are in one of these two persons; that is, all are either in Adam or in Christ.
[168]  Finally, the believers have been transferred out of the evil age, the crooked generation, that is, the religious world, the Judaic religion, the religious fold, into Christ and the church.
[169]  In this message we shall see that, as the last matter concerning the believers being made a new creation, we are made a new creation by being freed.
[170]  Galatians 4 reveals that the believers have been freed from law.
[171]  Verses 4 and 5 say, When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.
[172]  God s chosen people were shut up by law under its custody Gal 3:23 .
[173]  Christ was born under law in order to redeem them from its custody that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God.
[174]  Hence, they should not return to the custody of law to be under its slavery, but should remain in the sonship of God to enjoy the life supply of the Spirit in Christ.
[175]  Christ s redemption brings us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life.
[176]  Galatians 1:4 says that Christ gave Himself for our sins, that He might, rescue us out of the present evil age.
[177]  It is of God the Father that we have been saved 2 Thes 2:13 .
[178]  He is the very God becoming a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full redemption for us, through which He has saved us from God s condemnation and from our fallen condition.
[179]  It is a calling to the suffering of Christ, to the peace of Christ for His one Body, unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, into His eternal glory for the expression of the God of all grace, into God s own kingdom and glory, and for the believers to be separated and made holy unto God.
[180]  The New Testament reveals that the believers are saved from the law, the curse of the law, the bondage of the law, and the labor and burden under the law.
[181]  Galatians 4:4 and 5 indicate that God sent forth His Son to redeem us from under law, and Romans 6:14 tells us that we are no longer under the law.
[182]  First Peter 1:18 and 19 say, Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.
[183]  These verses indicate that the believers have been saved from the vain manner of life handed down from their fathers.
[184]  As those who have been saved from the vain manner of life handed down to us, we now have a life full of purpose, a life with God s goal in view.
[185]  In the foregoing message we saw that the believers are saved by God in His trinity and that they are saved with assurance.
[186]  God s salvation is secured by His irrevocable calling, which is based on His selection.
[187]  God selected us, chose us, before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .
[188]  It was not we who selected Him but He who selected us John 15:16 .
[189]  God has called us not according to our works but according to His own purpose 2 Tim 1:9 .
[190]  In John 10:28b the Lord Jesus declares concerning His believers, No one shall snatch them out of My hand.
[191]  The Son s mighty hand is for our protection.
[192]  Not only the Father s hand but also the Lord s hand will keep us from perishing.
[193]  First Thessalonians 1:9 says that the believers turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.
[194]  To turn to God from idols is not only to turn away from false gods, with the Devil and demons at their back, but also from all things that replace God.
