   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Forsaking the Past Ministries</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jonathan stood between Saul and David.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was one man standing between two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What he should have done was to follow the second ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, because Jonathan's relationship with the first ministry was too deep, he could not disentangle himself from it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to catch up with the ministry of the age, there is the need for us to see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Michal was married to David, yet she did not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She only saw David's condition before God, and she could not tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, she was left behind 2 Sam 6:16, 20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All Being a Matter of God's Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is God's mercy that a person can see and come into contact with the ministry of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet, it is altogether a different thing for a man to take up the courage to forsake the past ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a precious thing to see, and it is a blessed thing to come into contact with something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet whether or not one can set aside his past ministry is entirely up to God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CONCERNING THE CONTENT OF THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the relationship between the knowledge of life and the service?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Outward Man Being Broken,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and the Inward Life Being Released</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Nee answered: The word knowledge cannot adequately describe the way we are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether or not a man's ministry can be released depends not only on whether such a one knows life, but whether his outward man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The content of the ministry is fully a matter of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have an outward man, and we have an inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people's outward man is broken, and their ministries are released.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many years ago, I gave a message on the Lord's Day morning entitled "Deep Calls unto Deep."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A man who is not broken outwardly can only have "Shallow Calls unto Shallow."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every one of the brothers from Kiangsu is an eloquent speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet, when a person touches them, he feels that there is something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These brothers are like drops of oil on the water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are shallow, and they do not have any depths.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you ask them to speak, they can speak with their clever minds for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But after their speech, you cannot touch their spirit at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Outward Man Being Broken</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>for the Inward Man to Be Released</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we need today is for the outward man to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the outward man is not broken, the inward man will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything outward has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only when that which is outward is broken can that which is inward be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The earthen vessel has to be broken before the treasure can be released 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as the ointment is in the alabaster box, the fragrance will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when the box is broken will the fragrance be released John 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God deals with us daily through our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, the Lord works in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, He makes arrangements in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, for a Christian there is no such thing as the environment; with him, there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every environment is a discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The purpose of these disciplines is to break our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once a man's thoughts are broken, his inward man flows out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once a man's emotions are broken, also his inward man flows out.</S>
