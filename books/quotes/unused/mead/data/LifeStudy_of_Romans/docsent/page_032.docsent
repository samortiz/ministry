   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE EIGHT THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF JUSTIFICATION 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Paul wrote the book of Romans, he must have had the Old Testament in view.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 1 we find a clear reference to the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The phrase, the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, refers to Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The invisible things, meaning God s divine attributes, may be apprehended from creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, Paul began the book of Romans with an allusion to the first chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, Paul s account of the condemnation on mankind follows the stages f the fall of man recorded in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 4, Cain gave up God, disapproving of holding Him in his understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the time of Genesis 11, the entire fallen race had exchanged God for idols.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They exchanged the God of glory for idols of vanity and degenerated into fornication and confusion, which were manifested in the extreme at Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This resulted in the practice of every imaginable evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul used this history of the corrupted race as the background for the section on the condemnation of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Romans 3 Paul alludes to the picture of the ark with its cover as he portrays Christ as the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Romans 3 was also written with the Old Testament in view.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, when Paul came to the conclusion of justification, he employed the history of Abraham as a full example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abraham s history affords a complete pattern of the genuine and subjective justification of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we only had Paul s teaching in Romans 3, we could never appreciate the depths of God s justification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We would only have the seed of justification without the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE TRANSFUSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I feel the need to share more about the subjective experience of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In my spirit I am burdened that Romans 4 be fully opened to the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As I have said already, Romans 4 is a deep chapter, far deeper than we realize.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It presents Abraham s experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham is an example of the experience of God s called ones with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not have the adequate human language to describe such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After considering this matter very seriously, I have selected the word transfuse to help us understand the interaction between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The application of electricity depends on the fuse, and we may say that the power of electricity is applied through the fuse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The heavenly electricity is far away in the heavens, but the place where this electricity must be applied is here on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If this divine electricity is to come to us, we need a transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, God transfuses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we have this transfusion, we will experience a spiritual infusion as God s essence infiltrates our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This infusion of God s element will saturate and permeate us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Transfusion brings in infusion, and this infusion permeates us with God s element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FAITH AS A REACTION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This permeation causes a reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spiritual virtues and divine attributes that have been transmitted into us will react within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first reaction is believing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the highest definition of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Faith is not our natural ability or virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Faith is our reaction toward God, which results from God s transfusing Himself into us and infusing His divine elements into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God s elements permeate our being, we react to Him, and this reaction is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Faith is not a human virtue; it is absolutely a reaction caused by a divine infusion, which saturates and permeates our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once we have such a faith, we can never lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is deeper than our blood, for it has been infused into us and constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we may try not to believe, we can never succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what the Bible means by believing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If my memory is accurate, Paul never uses the term by faith in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, at least two or three times he mentions the faith of Jesus, a phrase that troubles most translators.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some, finding it difficult to define such a phrase, have changed the preposition from of to in. If we change the preposition, the phrase will read faith in Jesus and mean that we believe in Jesus by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not Paul s meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul means that we believe in the Lord Jesus by means of the Lord Jesus Himself as our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since we do not have the ability to believe, we must take Christ as our believing ability.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to believe in the Lord Jesus by His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have tried to understand this for nearly forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the past I explained faith as Christ working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That was the best definition I had at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, in the last few days the Lord has given me a better term: faith is our reaction to God produced by His transfusion, infusion, and saturation.</S>
