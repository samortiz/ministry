   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWELVE BASKETS FULL 4 Issue No. 7 BUSY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Busy is a common word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the burdens that the Lord gives to us are light and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has not asked us to bear what we cannot bear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is important to remember this, for this fact will afford us much comfort!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some Christians carry with them the slogan: "I am too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am really busy."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are laboring day and night, and there is not a moment of free time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems as if their burdens are indeed heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not just speaking of ordinary believers who labor in their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am also speaking of workers who labor directly in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not the Lord's will for His children to be busy day and night and have no time to be in quietness and solitude, to commune, fellowship, and converse with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither is it the Lord's will for His workers to be fishing day and night without having time to mend their nets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let me say an honest word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people are busy for nothing, and they are busy unnecessarily!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every child of God should pause to think: "Will my job really not get done if I am not that busy?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am afraid that many bustlings are needless and unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet we are still confusingly busy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is either caused by Satan's instigation or by the demand in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How harsh are these two masters: Satan and our environment!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan's way is either to pull back or to push forward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he cannot draw us back and keep us from going on, he will push us and cause us to go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am afraid that many of the bustlings are instigated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is there a minute that the demands in our environment will abate?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every hour and every minute, the demands stand waiting for us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can we take that as our standard?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know that many times we can clearly get by without being so busy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our being busy is a result of the agitation of the environment, and it is unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The best guide to our work is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are all the things that have been keeping you busy all day long the things that God wants you to do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they are not, why are you doing them?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What makes us busy is not the great and important things, but the small and miscellaneous matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are all these matters what the Lord wants us to do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we examine all our works in this way, I am afraid a lot of items will be scratched off from our daily schedule!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Generally speaking, whenever works become numerous and we become busy, our hearts are confused, and we lose the inner peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"But Martha was being drawn about with much serving" Luke 10:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord wants us to maintain our quietness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not want us to miss the top blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to realize that it is not by much work that we receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We receive the reward by carrying out God's will faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If something is not the will of God, what benefit is there for us to do it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not because we want to forsake our duty, but because we want to please the Lord more and have more time to fellowship with Him that we do not allow ourselves to be distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In summary, it is better to be busy in prayer than to be busy in work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person can accomplish more by prayer than by being busy.</S>
