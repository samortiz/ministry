   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FAITH VERSUS REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past two messages, we have seen that the way of salvation on man's side is through faith, rather than the law or works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that salvation is by faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not by faith with the law, nor is it by faith with works Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, besides the law and works, man still tries to use other ways to obtain God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we cannot cover these ways in detail, we hope that we can enumerate all of them in the coming two messages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Besides the law and works, repentance also is often considered by man as a very important condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man thinks that if he does not repent, he will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are acquainted with the Bible dare not say that repentance is the only condition for salvation, but they would say that a man is saved by faith with repentance, or through repenting and believing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I admit that the subject of repentance is not easy to understand in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if one would consider the Word of God itself, he would understand the real meaning of repentance and would find out quickly if repentance is a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE THREE BOOKS ON SALVATION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NOT LISTING REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AS THE CONDITION FOR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we talk about the meaning of repentance in the Bible and its relationship with faith and salvation, we should first clarify a few things concerning repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After that, we will consider what the Bible says about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the entire Bible, there is only one book that tells us how we receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This book is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the very beginning to the very end of the Gospel of John, we cannot find a single occurrence of the word repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word repentance never occurs in this book at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This book tells us how we can have eternal life 3:15, 16b, 36 , but nothing is mentioned about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It mentions repeatedly that man receives eternal life through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a man believes, he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It never mentions repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only does it not mention repentance directly, it does not mention repentance even indirectly or metaphorically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a fact that we have to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, there are two books which tell us how man is justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are Romans and Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The book of Romans does mention repentance, but it never makes repentance a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither of these books has ever made repentance a condition for salvation and promise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we have to remember that of the three books in the Bible that deal specifically with salvation, eternal life, and justification, not once is repentance mentioned as a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In all three books, faith is mentioned every time as the only condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows us clearly that man is saved by faith and not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MAN EMPHASIZING REPENTANCE THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A MIND FILLED WITH THE LAW AND WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why does man pay so much attention to repentance?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is because man's mind has the poison of the law and works remaining in it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Salvation is free, but because man's mind is full of the law and works, he never considers that God would give salvation to him freely.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He never thinks that God would freely bear man's burden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He always thinks that he has to do something good before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether it is the keeping of the law, the performing of good works, or the need for repentance, man always thinks that he has to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems as if man is never willing to be an unconditional beneficiary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He never wants to stand in a position of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although he realizes that it is impossible to do everything, he thinks that he must at least do something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is precisely this doing that has twisted the biblical meaning of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It turns repentance into our repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please remember that the repentance mentioned in the Bible and the repentance that we talk about are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is repentance according to man's mind?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the human concept, repentance is improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to his mind, repentance is not something for the past, but is something to deal with the present and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Formerly, I was sinful, fallen, degraded, and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now I want to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, I have to improve myself from today on and make myself look better.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Chinese word for repentance is hwe-gai.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hwe means to feel sorry, and gai means to change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some have invented a new doctrine, unknown to the New Testament, based on this Chinese word, saying that some people only hwe but do not gai.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, they say that it is not enough just to feel sorry; there must also be a change.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why does man pay so much attention to change?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is because man's thought is full of works.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why he emphasizes works so much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He says that since everything he did before was wrong, he must no longer be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He realizes that he was bad and that he was a sinner, but now, he should not be bad and should no longer be a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Formerly he sinned, and before God he was clothed in rags; he had squandered all of his Father's possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How then can he be accepted when he returns home?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Surely he has to do business, and make some money.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Surely he should have on the best robe and a pair of shoes before he can return home.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man's thought is that he needs a certain degree of improvement before he can return home.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If his clothes are not proper and he looks the same as before, perhaps the Father would not accept him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he would improve somewhat, although there is still no assurance whether the Father would accept him, at least there is a better and greater chance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Man never considers that it is possible to go to God and receive salvation in his present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He always wants to improve himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He admits that he cannot be perfect in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But he thinks that he still has to have something and trust in the Lord for the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To him, it is like gambling; he has to place a bet before he can gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This bet which he places is the repentance that man talks about.</S>
