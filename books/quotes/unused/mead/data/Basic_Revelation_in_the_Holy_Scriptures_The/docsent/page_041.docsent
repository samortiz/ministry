   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Overcoming</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Going Along with God's Transforming Work</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's desire is to have a people who will go along with Him to overcome Satan and all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is possible for us, not in ourselves but by His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To overcome is to experience this full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This salvation includes our spirit's regeneration and our soul's full transformation, issuing in our body's transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say this is easy, but to experience this needs much work of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have been regenerated in our spirit, and we are being transformed in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether we overcome or are defeated depends upon the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we let the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit transform us day after day, we shall be overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even now we are overcomers, because we are going along with the Triune God's transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as we are going along with His transforming work, we are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we do not go along with His work in us, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we are overcomers or defeated ones depends on our attitude toward God's transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God today is within us, working to transform our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is renewing our mind, our will, and our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no problem with our spirit; it has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem is in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is concentrating His transforming work on our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is our attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To obey God is to go along with His work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are all here under His transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this work on our soul is completed, we shall be fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the Lord Jesus will return to redeem, transfigure, our body, and we shall be in glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our Daily Life</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The matter of the kingdom is very much related to our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's transforming work is actually His exercising of His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians have been distracted by soulish pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may also be distracted from God's economy by different forms of amusement, entertainment, or sports.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God the Spirit is working within us, trying to transform our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, as a lover of Jesus you know that you should not go to a dancing party.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may want to go, but the transforming Spirit is struggling within you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Something within you says that this is not the right thing for a lover of Jesus to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, that struggling within you is the working of the Holy Spirit to transform your mind Rom 12:2 concerning the matter of dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He also desires to transform your emotion in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your emotion should not be toward dancing, but toward the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you cooperate with this transforming work?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes the saints are defeated, and they go dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time they are defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, you can take grace to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit and say, "Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I will follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I go along with Your move within me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I will go to the church meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This choice involves more than going to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It means that you are transformed in your mind concerning dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your emotion is also transformed: rather than loving to dance, you love to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This transforming also involves your will because you determined not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You said, "Satan, I will not go to such an evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I will go to the church meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By taking such a stand, your mind and your emotion and your will are all touched.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be touched in this way is to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This illustrates how the Lord as the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling us is doing His transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you go along with it, you are an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, you are a defeated one.</S>
