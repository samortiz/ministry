   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OUTER MAN AND THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The apostle Paul in the book of 2 Corinthians builds upon the foundation laid in the book of 1 Corinthians by pointing out the contrast between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, in 2 Corinthians Paul does not refer to them as the soul and the spirit, but as the outer man and the inner man 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of referring to the soul and spirit as mere parts within the human being, he referred to them as two men the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the soul was just a part within our being, our dealing with the soul would be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same would be true for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the spirit today is not simply a part within us; it is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should realize that each one of these two, the soul and the spirit, is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we have two men within us the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life of the outer man is the self and the life of the inner man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have two men with two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The self-life is the life of the soul, and Christ is the spiritual life of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The unbelievers, who do not have Christ in them as their life, do not have the controversy between the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They just live by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians who have received Christ are complicated because they have received another life into them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have two lives within them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Christians are bothered by the Lord within them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we had not received Christ, we would simply live by ourselves and not have any bothering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since we have received Christ, however, we are involved with Him and are bothered by Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now that we have received Christ, we will be involved with Him for our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may want to divorce Him, but He would not divorce us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason we are bothered is that, although we have Christ as our life, we often do not like to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So there is a controversy, a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we like to have Christ as our life, but on the other hand, we may not like to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have received Christ, but instead of living by Him, we live by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CONSUMING OF THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has been laid as a foundation within our being, but we are not in agreement with the structure to be built upon that foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this kind of situation, we need the outer man to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under the sovereign hand of the Lord, there is the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul mentions that the outer man is decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some translations such as the King James Version say perish, and Darby's New Translation translates this word as consumed, which seems to be a better rendering than perish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be consumed means to be torn down; that is, the outer man is torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This tearing down is that we may no longer live by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not an easy job because from our birth we were raised and educated to live by our self.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, to give up our self is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet the giving up of our self is the teaching needed by today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Normal Christian Life, which was first released in spoken form by Brother Watchman Nee in about 1938 or 1939, has become quite prevailing throughout many of the Western countries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This book is primarily concerned with the foundation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, another book entitled The Release of the Spirit, a series of messages given about ten years later by Brother Nee, contains something as a structure built upon the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the later messages are a development of the earlier ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The breaking of the outer man and the release of the spirit are the messages needed by the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we all must know what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is our life and our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has been put into us as the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now if we are going to build upon this foundation, our outer man must be consumed that we may live not by the outer man but by the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The inner man is neither Christ Himself solely, nor the human spirit itself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The inner man is the human spirit regenerated and indwelt by Christ and mingled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we need to cooperate with this consuming work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we cooperate with this work, the more problems we will be saved from.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we struggle, going against this breaking down work, then we will experience more problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need the real willingness to say to the Lord, "Lord, I have been regenerated and I now have You within me as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am clear that I have to give up my own life, the soulish life, that I have to take You as my life, and that I must live by You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, I am willing to cooperate with You."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a prayer will save a lot of trouble.</S>
