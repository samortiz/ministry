   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c In Danger of Dying and Decreasing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Deuteronomy 33:6 Moses uttered a prophecy regarding Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This prophecy, a judgment according to the law, was spoken through an experienced, sympathetic old man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses said, "Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word implies that, according to the law, Reuben should have died.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to his sin, Reuben should have died Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Reuben should have died, Moses was merciful in executing the judgment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As an old judge, he judged the twelve tribes according to God's righteous law, but he nonetheless judged mercifully and sympathetically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moses was concerned either that Reuben would die or that the number of his tribe would be greatly decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we see that fornication not only causes us to lose our birthright; it may also cause us to die or to be decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must flee fornication 1 Cor 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Joseph received the birthright because he fled from the very defilement that Reuben indulged in 39:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joseph did not go in the house purposely to be with Potiphar's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was a servant working in the house, and she tempted him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Joseph fled from this temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever this temptation comes, the only way to deal with it is to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not talk or reason with the other party run away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Reuben lost the birthright because of his defilement, and Joseph obtained it because of his purity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is righteous, just, and fair.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Reuben was on the dark side, and he lost; Joseph was on the bright side, and he gained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Reuben was in danger of dying, or at least of being reduced, Moses prayed that he would not die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anyone in the church life who commits fornication will be in a very dangerous position.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will not only lose the top portion of the enjoyment of Christ; he will be in danger of dying or of being reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the experience of Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The birthright is composed not only of the double portion of the land, but also of the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the firstborn, Reuben should have inherited all three blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Due to his defilement, he lost not only the double portion of the land, but also the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have seen, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph, the kingship was given to Judah 1 Chron 5:2 , and the priesthood was given to Levi Deut 33:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This typifies that today, if we allow ourselves to be defiled, we shall lose the double portion of enjoying Christ, the kingship, and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>6 Concerning Simeon and Levi a Receiving No Blessing because of Their Cruelty</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that Simeon and Levi received no blessing because of their cruelty 34:25-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their cruelty in slaughtering and plundering the city of Shechem frightened their father to such an extent that he could not give them any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their indulgence in their disposition caused them to lose the father's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>b To Be Scattered in Israel</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jacob was frightened by Simeon and Levi's cruel disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, he would not allow them to dwell together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, he exercised judgment over them to scatter them among the children of Israel so that they would not be able to behave cruelly according to their disposition.</S>
