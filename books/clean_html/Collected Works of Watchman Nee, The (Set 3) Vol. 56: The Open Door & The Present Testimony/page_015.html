<h2 class="head2">It Was Given by Him (Shenyang)</h2><p>After a conference with Brother Fang Ai-guang from Peking, we established the Lord's table on January 29 of this year. There were more than forty brothers and sisters. We preached the gospel during the first month of the lunar calendar, and the Lord gradually has added the saved ones to the church. There were two baptism meetings in April and in June. We added fifty-four newly saved brothers and sisters. With the addition of the brothers and sisters who migrated to Shenyang from other localities, we now have one hundred twenty people. There was only one room in our old meeting hall on Minzhu Road in the Hoping District. We experienced great difficulties with every meeting and dared not expand the gospel work. Consequently, all the brothers and sisters cried constantly to the Lord and begged Him to meet the need. The church began to pray on December 13 of last year. We saw the Lord accomplish the matter of a meeting place on July 20 of this year. What He has given us is far greater than what we asked or thought. We moved into the new meeting hall and began the meetings there on the twenty-second of this month (the Lord's Day).</p><p>The brothers and sisters do not have much financial supply; many brothers are unemployed and have problems making a living. Because the Lord's gospel could not be preached and sinners could not be saved, we still earnestly beseeched the ever-living God. He heard the prayers of the church and finally showed us His glory. All the obstacles were broken through. When we remembered the Lord for the first time in the new meeting hall on the twenty-second (the Lord's Day), all the brothers and sisters were happy and rejoicing. We could not refrain from dancing, shouting thanks, weeping, and praising because we saw that the Lord has performed a miracle in Shenyang! We were all in an inexpressible, indescribable condition. There was a gospel meeting on the Lord's Day morning. The brothers and sisters all served in one accord. Those who brought new ones brought many; those who cared for people really cared. The place was nearly full. When we drew the net, forty-six people left their names. Since May we have recorded the names of more than two hundred people who are interested in the gospel.</p><p>In the matter of service, we have made some arrangements concerning visitation and making up the new believer edification lessons. We are seeing the Lord's blessing. Many of the brothers and sisters have given themselves to the Lord with tears. They have given their whole lives and do not want to go out free. They are willing and happy to serve. But the work ahead and the needs on all sides are too many and too great. We are immature and shallow in life; we cannot bear this burden. Since the Lord has made this arrangement, we can only prostrate ourselves, looking to Him for mercy so that He would lead us in the way before us. We hope that all the brothers and sisters would remember us before the Lord and pray for us.</p><p>From the brothers in Shenyang,<br />Ren Li-ping, Shan Jing-zhou, Shen Yu-shi, and Kuan Yu-nong<br />October 31, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord's Grace Was Greater than Our Capacity</h2><p>After arriving in Ch'ang-ch'un, we prayed for a period of time. We are in a wilderness area, and the Lord has placed us small and weak ones here. We have no other way but to kneel before Him. Recently, the Lord has shown us that He is the Lord of the work. He is the One who opens a highway in the wilderness. He is the One who brings the rivers to the deserts. He operates in the church to accomplish His work. Therefore, we did not look at our smallness but went to Dalian and Shenyang to prostrate ourselves before God with the brothers and sisters so that He would give us a new vision and leading. Through the fellowship of the Body, we communicated with the entire church what we had seen and touched in the Holy Spirit. We asked the Lord to give us more so that we could serve all God's children. We have no other way but to humbly look to God to take us on each step of the way. We hope to encounter God's power more in the work. The Lord is also leading us to live in faith by His faithfulness.</p><p>Concerning the conferences in Dalian and Shenyang, the Lord's grace was greater than our capacity. At Shenyang brothers and sisters came from more than ten other localities. Sister Kang gave the sisters some leading. After the meetings we helped them coordinate together; this built up the service of the entire Body. Once the church has been graced, it must continue with the proper service. Otherwise, it will appear as if it has run out of the proper vessels to contain the grace. May our arrangements all be according to the Lord's desire.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Hua Tien-min and Xing Zuo-hsin<br />December 8, 1950</p>
