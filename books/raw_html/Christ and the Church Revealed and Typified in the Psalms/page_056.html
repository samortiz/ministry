<p>Suppose now that the leading brothers of that particular local church hear these two young brothers speaking in such a way and are deeply offended. They arise to defend themselves and assert their authority. If the leading brothers react in this way, it means that they also are not under the headship of Christ, that they also are not giving Christ the pre-eminence. They should bow down and say, “Lord, the pre-eminence is Thine, the first place is Yours. Though we may be the leading ones, we are nobody. The young brothers are not wrong; we are really poor.” Perhaps the brothers and sisters in that place may, in a sense, be poor, but they are giving the first place to the Lord, the pre-eminence to Christ. There you will see the restoration of God’s house. If they fight one with another, the young people against the leading ones, and the leading ones against the young people, there will only be desolation. The young people will attempt to justify themselves, and the leading ones will vindicate their position. This is nothing but desolation. They are desolating the church. Whenever Christ loses His pre-eminence among us, the church is wrong. We all must submit ourselves to His headship and say, “None among us is anybody; You are the only One, Lord, who has the pre- eminence. We give You the pre-eminence, Lord.” Regardless of how weak we are, regardless of how poor we are, if we take this attitude, there is the possibility for the restoration of God’s house. The desolation will be past; it will be swallowed up by the restoration.<p>Christ must be afforded the proper position by the people of God. God has already given Him the highest place in the universe. Now every one of us, both the young brothers and sisters and the elder brothers and sisters, must give Him His due place. Never take the pre-eminence among the Lord’s people in the local church; the pre-eminence must always be given to Christ. The first secret for us in maintaining the house of God and restoring it from desolation is to give the pre-eminence to Christ.<p>Sometimes the sisters in the local churches cause the problem by not giving the pre-eminence to the Lord. Philippians 4 speaks of two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, who caused a problem in the church at Philippi. It is strange that I have never heard of parents naming their daughters by these two names. At the beginning, the situation in that church was excellent, but then a problem arose due to these two sisters. Many times, simply because of two sisters, there is disunity in a church. In one of the local churches recently, I referred to these two sisters in Philippians 4, and on the very next day a sister stood up, weeping, confessing her faults and asking another sister to forgive her. Both of them wept. Some of the brothers said to me later, “When you spoke from Philippians 4, you prophesied concerning the condition here. These two sisters were the problem in this local church.” If any of us, especially any of the sisters, fail to give the pre-eminence to the Lord, there will be desolation in the church. The church life will be restored if we will always say, “We are nobody; Christ is the only One; we give Him the pre-eminence.”<p>You must pray-read these two verses, Psalm 80:15 and 17, and stay with them for some time. “And the vineyard maintain which thy right hand hath planted, and the son that thou madest strong for thyself.…Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.” This is Christ, the unique Man, the unique Son. This is the One who has been approved at the right hand of God the Father. He has the pre-eminence, the first place in the entire universe, and we must recognize this. If we as God’s people will give Him such pre-eminence, the restoration of the church life will take place. The desolation of the church is due mostly to Christ not being given His rightful position.
