This does not refer to our spirit being right versus being wrong. A right spirit is an upright spirit. This means that it can stand as something constant. Some versions say that this is a steadfast, constant, or firm spirit. An upright spirit is a spirit that is immovable, unshakable, standing constantly as something firm and steady.</P><P>Psalm 51 was the psalm of David for his repentance. He repented that his spirit was not upright. In other words, his spirit did not stand upright constantly. His spirit was not steady, not firm, so he was able to be seduced, or tempted, and he fell. In his repentance he prayed that the Lord would let him have an upright spirit, a constant, firm, steady spirit. In his prayer for restoration, he asked the Lord to renew such a spirit within him. We always need an upright spirit, which is always steadfast, firm, constant, immovable, and unshakable so that we can never be tempted, seduced, or misled.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Life &nbsp; pg 92</div><br></body></html>
