   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter twenty-three is the easiest chapter in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter contains only teachings; it does not have any doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 1:"Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Lord's preaching, He never mixed the multitude with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the mixing here is quite unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason the Lord mixed them together is that the following teaching put the disciples in the position of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The teaching in this chapter is specifically for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2:"Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in Moses' seat."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Seated themselves in Moses' seat."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Jewish history, since the time of Moses the Jews underwent several significant changes: wicked kings, captivity, and destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, people had become ignorant and no longer observed the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only exception was a group of zealous individuals who came out publicly to lead the Jews back to the original law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of people were the forefathers of the Pharisees and the scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the beginning these people were genuinely standing in the position of Moses to execute and teach the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet generation after generation went by until the time of Jesus, when only the name remained but not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here the Lord did not deny that, nominally, they were still sitting in Moses' seat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 3:"Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Do and keep" all the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before the death of the Lord, the Jews still had to observe the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law did not cease until the Lord died.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time they were not yet free from the law; hence, the Lord charged the Jews and His disciples to observe the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The principle in this verse is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today among the churches there are two opinions concerning the law: 1 A person is saved by grace and not by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After one is saved, he still does not have to keep the commandments, except the commandment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 A person is saved by grace and not by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if one desires to be sanctified, he must observe the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first opinion is the correct one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the main focus of the book of Romans, a sinner cannot be justified by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Galatians, a saved person cannot be sanctified by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, these two books are sufficient to prove that justification and sanctification can never be obtained by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The teaching in Romans 7 shows that a saved person who still keeps the law is an adulterer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he still keeps the law, then the law is not yet dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he then desires to marry Christ, this is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we must die completely to the law in order that we may gain eternal life through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the period of time the disciples were in then, the Lord spoke concerning the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the Lord resurrected, He did not mention this matter anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"They say things and do not do them."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is altogether contrary to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord is "powerful in work and word" Luke 24:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today many preachers also can say things but cannot do them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 4:"And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders" means that based on the law, they created more laws besides the existing laws, and bound them on men's shoulders; yet they themselves would not follow the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Originally, they decided that 1 the transgressor of Moses' law would be punished, but the transgressor of their law could be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2 Gradually the two laws became equally important; transgressors of both laws would be punished equally.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3 Finally, it was the transgressor of the law of Moses who could be forgiven, and the transgressor of their law who had to be severely punished.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They considered their law the essence of Moses' law, and that they were, therefore, more important.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The corban was one example of this Mark 7:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today's charters, creeds, beliefs etc. are of the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among the laws, they observed the easy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those that they could not observe, they charged the multitude of Jews to observe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today men are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They take the easy ones among the commandments in the Scriptures to be for the Gentiles, and the hard ones such as Matthew 5 7 to be for the Jews or for the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Can it be that they have learned from the Pharisees?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 5:"And all their works they do to be seen by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes of their garments."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here the Lord pointed out that "all their works they do to be seen by men."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord exposed their true form and real image and pointed out that this was most dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Donations and preachings are but the false masks of some who want to show off their zeal and "spirituality."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Phylacteries" the Jews strapped Scripture quotations to their bodies see Deut 6:8; 11:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Fringes" the borders of the garments; the Scriptures were sewn on the borders of their garments.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verse 6:"And they love the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is pride before men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The following verses are concerning men.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 7:"And the salutations in the market places and to be called by men, Rabbi."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The same is true with men today: they like to be others' teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nevertheless, here the Lord wants us to see clearly their goal and intention.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many times we are very zealous, and we do many good works.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But what is the goal and the intention of all these?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 8:"But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord turned the subject here for our instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"But you, do not be called Rabbi."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All believers are equal on earth, and no one can be higher than another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the church, the term pastor is but another name for Rabbi.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Elders and deacons are appointed only for the purpose of service; there is no existence of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whoever receives a clerical rank or a clerical position has degraded to the position of the Pharisees.</S>
