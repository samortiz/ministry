   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT TWO KINDS OF OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Gen 3:7, 21; 2:15; 4:1-8; Rom 8:6-8; Phil 3:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 2 4 are very familiar to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often preach the gospel from them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But what God says to His children in these chapters is actually more than what He says to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through these few chapters of the Bible, God shows us the way He has established for us to walk in.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After Adam sinned, he immediately employed a way and a method to save himself: He used fig leaves to sew himself an apron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fig leaves were grown from the ground, and they were the result of Adam and Eve's dressing and keeping of the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, they tried to use what they produced themselves to cover their shame.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man realized before God that he had fallen and sinned, so he quickly devised ways to remedy the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first act of man after his fall was to improve his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we first believed in the Lord, we did not realize the depth and extent of man's works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thought they just stemmed from man's wish to do good to save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, man's work implies that, after his fall, he wanted to satisfy God with the best that he could produce with his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He realized that he was naked, that he was shameful, and that he was not acceptable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, he devised a way to cover himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He wanted to do good to satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While man was struggling with his own ways, God gave him a revelation by making coats of skin to cloth them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This signified that not only did the redemption of man require blood and the death of another but also that man's own works could not cover his shame before God or satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since man has sinned, there is only one way of obtaining salvation, and that is through the cross and through death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Coats of skin signify not only the death of the Savior but also the death of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Corinthians 5:14 clearly says, "One died for all, therefore all died."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not say that since one died for all, then all do not need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It says, "One died for all, therefore all died."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In making coats of skin for Adam and Eve, God was pronouncing death upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time of the Passover, the blood of the Lamb was put on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God said, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" Exo 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By clothing Adam and Eve with coats of skin, God showed that salvation not only requires the forgiveness of sins through the death of the Savior, but also the death of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Salvation involves not only resolving the problem of our sin but also the termination of us as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God dealt not only with sin but also with our person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; this was sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They sewed aprons of fig trees; this was their good work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must realize that God rejected not only the eating of the fruit but the sewing of the aprons as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a man sins, he displeases God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he performs good works by his own effort, he also displeases God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man's need consists not only of blood but also of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we understand Genesis 3, we can readily understand chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After Adam sinned, he sewed aprons with the result of his labor the fig leaves to cover himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cain, the son of Adam, followed the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He offered the produce from the land, the results of his own cultivation, unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Cain did exactly the same thing as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only difference was that Adam's work was for himself, while Cain's work was offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Adam wanted to cover himself with his works in the hope of making himself a good man, whereas Cain offered God the produce from the land in the hope of pleasing God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In principle, their works were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While this was occurring in Genesis 3, God clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skin, signifying that the cross must be upon them and that death must work upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was God's revelation to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Genesis 4, Abel took God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Abel offered unto God the firstling of his flock and of their fat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What was so special about Abel was that he understood the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He realized that man had sinned and had to die and that without his death man could not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What were the results of the offerings of Cain and Abel?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible tells us that "the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God accepted Abel and his offering, but not Cain and his offering because Abel pleased God in accordance with the way of salvation established by God, while Cain tried to please Him through his own flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Cain's offering implied that even though man had sinned and was fallen, he did not need to die; rather, he could work on his own and use the labor of his work to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man thinks that the leaves he cultivates can cover his shame and produce from the land can be offered to God to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Cain relied upon his works to come before God; he had not passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He thought he could please God by his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God did not look upon it and would not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Abel's offering seemed to say, "O my God, the skin You have ordained enabled me to be a proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I now offer You the fat under the skin to please You.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The skin is for me and the fat is for You."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Both the skin and the fat are the results of death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only through death could Abel obtain skin to clothe himself, and only through death could he obtain the fat to offer to God.</S>
