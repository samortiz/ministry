TO KNOW THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>
<p>The requirement concerning revelation is even higher, because a revelation is God making known the intent of His heart. Psalm 25:14 says, &ldquo;The intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him.&rdquo; Intimate counsel carries a sense of revelation, indicating that if we want to receive God&rsquo;s revelation, we must be those who draw near to Him. If we are those who draw near to God, contact Him, and are joined to Him, we will be one spirit with the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; If we are joined to the Lord in spirit, we will surely receive revelation. Revelation is different from teaching and is deeper than teaching; it requires us to be those who draw near to God, fellowship with God, be one spirit with the Lord every day, and labor on the Bible continually; if we are such persons, God will reveal much to us through the words of the Bible. This kind of revelation does not necessarily come to us in the church meetings but is obtained through our reading the Word and praying at home during our daily living.</p>
<p>Revelation primarily enables us to know the mystery of God, which in the New Testament is God&rsquo;s economy. This New Testament economy consists mainly of two great mysteries: the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. Hence, Christ and the church are the two great mysteries in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is not a teaching; it is altogether a revelation.</p>
<p>A person does not receive this kind of revelation by memorizing the Bible. A person may be familiar with the Bible and adept in linking together verses in the Bible, yet he may not have any revelation or light. We must realize that we will not necessarily have light simply because we are familiar with the Bible. Having light is altogether a matter of our spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible is a great book. Though people may expound it using their wild imagination, it never loses its greatness and authenticity. I was born into fundamental and organized Christianity and read a number of books after I was saved; nevertheless, it was not until I met the Brethren that I began to know some of the fundamental and accurate truths. The truth that the Brethren taught was pure and accurate. This was a great adjustment and cleansing for me, allowing me to become clear concerning all the improper doctrines that I had received. Later, I came into contact with Brother Nee. He was a person who knew the Bible very well. Both of us had contacted what fundamental Christianity passed down.</p>
<p>In the history of Christianity from the sixth century to the sixteenth century, a total of ten centuries, the Roman Catholic Church locked up the Bible, causing the church to fall into the Dark Ages, an age without God&rsquo;s word, revelation, and light. In the 1500s Martin Luther rose up to introduce some reforms. Prior to Luther, people such as John Wycliffe and John Huss had already begun the work of reformation. The state churches and private churches that were produced by the Reformation were all orthodox. Then in the eighteenth century, John Wesley rose up. At the same time, in the southern part of Germany Count Zinzendorf opened his estate to the Lord&rsquo;s believers because of his love for Him. This resulted in the producing of the Moravian Brethren and brought in a great revival. A century later, the British Brethren were raised up. All the Brethren groups were orthodox. In the interval the mystics were also raised up, and they too were orthodox. Later, William Law made mysticism practical and brought in the matter of the inner life. We have inherited everything orthodox from the past nineteen hundred years.</p>
<p>Bible exposition has its unchanging principles, which have been established through the studies by Bible scholars throughout the generations over the past nineteen hundred years. We must solemnly say that through our collecting and compiling work, most of these riches have been &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; in the Recovery Version of the New Testament. If we read the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament carefully from beginning to end, we will see that all the principles are contained in it. These principles form the standard that secures our understanding, comprehension, and expounding of the Bible so that we would not stray from the truth. These principles also apply in our expounding of the prophecies, types, plain texts, and history of the Bible. Because the Bible is the revelation of the mystery of God, our application of these principles will preserve us from straying off.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to receive a revelation we must be proper persons. Our being must be right, and we must be those who seek the Lord Himself and are able to teach something. This is the minimum requirement. Second, we must advance further. Not only must we be right, but we must also know the spirit and have deep fellowship with the Lord in spirit. Hence, we need to be teachers who are able to teach something and prophets who are able to speak for the Lord. In prophesying, we speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. A large part of prophesying consists of revelation. For example, the praise offered by Mary is a prophecy, but it is also full of light and revelation. She said, &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior&rdquo; (Luke 1:46-47). This word is a word of revelation. If we want to prophesy in such a way, our person must not only be right, but our spirit must also maintain close fellowship with the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
