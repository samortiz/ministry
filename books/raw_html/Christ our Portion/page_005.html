<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REALITY OF BEING IN SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10; 8:1-2, 9-10; 10:6-8; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1><h2 class=head1>RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF CHRIST AND SAVED IN HIS LIFE</h2><p>Romans 5:10 says, “For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.” In this verse two important things are mentioned: His death and His life. Through the fall of Adam we became enemies to God, but through the death of Christ we were reconciled to God. Now, having been reconciled, we shall be saved more and more by the life of Christ. The death of Christ was sufficient for us to be reconciled to God, and the life of Christ is good for us to be saved from many negative things.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN YOU—THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE BOOK OF ROMANS</h2><p>Christ in you is the central point of the book of Romans. Romans 8:9-10 says, “But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.” The book of Romans tells us that Christ was put on the cross in order to accomplish redemption (3:24; 4:25), He was then resurrected from among the dead (4:25), and then He ascended to the heavens (8:34). Here in Romans 8:10 the Christ who was put on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens is in us. Today Christ is in us. This is the central point of the whole book of Romans.<p>In addition, Romans 8:9-10 reveals three divine titles: the Spirit of God (v. 9), the Spirit of Christ (v. 9), and Christ Himself (v. 10). This simply means that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>FIRST CORINTHIANS AS THE ENTRANCE TO COLOSSIANS</h2><p>In order to understand the book of Colossians, 1 Corinthians and Colossians must be combined together. Without 1 Corinthians there is no entrance to the book of Colossians. There is the need to combine these books because both of them reveal that Christ Himself is our divine portion (1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 30; Col. 1:12). First Corinthians tells us that Christ, the portion allotted to us, is our wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:30). Righteousness is for our spirit to be regenerated, sanctification is for our soul to be transformed, and redemption is for our body to be transfigured. The day we received Christ as our Savior, He became our righteousness, we were justified through Him, and by this justification, our spirit was regenerated (Rom. 5:18). The regeneration of our spirit has been accomplished through the righteousness of God which is just Christ Himself (Rom. 3:22, 24). From the time we were regenerated until the present day, we have been in the process of sanctification, which is the transformation of the soul. Our spirit has been regenerated. Now our soul must be transformed. Ultimately, in the future when the Lord returns, our body will be redeemed. Our body will be transfigured, not only by Christ but with Christ. Christ is regeneration to our spirit, Christ is the transformation to our soul, and Christ is the transfiguration to our body. Christ has been allotted to us by God as our unsearchably rich portion.<p>If 1 Corinthians revealed only this much to us, we would still need a door, an entrance, in order to enter into and realize all of these wonderful things. Therefore, in 15:45 we are told that this Christ, who is the portion allotted to us by God, became a life-giving Spirit. This word concerning Christ being the life-giving Spirit is one of the most crucial truths in the entire New Testament.
