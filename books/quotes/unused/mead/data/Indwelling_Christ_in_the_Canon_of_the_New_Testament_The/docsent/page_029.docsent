   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FATHER S HAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everything is ordered by our Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In doing everything, including the Lord s work, we expect it to be one way, but it turns out to be another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times, we simply cannot tell the reason why it happened that way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may inquire why, but the answer is always the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Father s hand ordered it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You need it, and I need it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, the Chinese people like to take much time, with the help of their parents, to select their partner in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the American young people are more simple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After getting to know each other for two months, they marry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But regardless of how selective we are, it does not depend on our selection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is all under the Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You don t know what kind of wife you need, but the Father knows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And you don t know what kind of husband you need, the Father knows.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No wife is a wrong wife, and no husband is a wrong husband.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were all selected by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we get is exactly what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Father s hand could never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may think that we made the wrong choice, but God the Father still is right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If His little finger touched our marriage plans just a little, that marriage could never occur.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A number of times I made some mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I regretted much, but then I started to thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Father, I thank Thee that I made a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I realized that without making such a mistake I would never have such a good opportunity to experience the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To talk about taking Christ as our person is easy, but to get to the experience requires much pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, we would not give up our independence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be pressed out of our measure, beyond our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must even despair of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul said, But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead 2 Cor 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To have the sentence of death means that, to Paul s understanding, he should die.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was resurrected!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of us expect to have a good job.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And in doing business, everyone likes to make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, sometimes, the profit is taken to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Father s hand ordered it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He ordered it just to press us that we should not trust in ourselves, but in the living God who raises the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE OUTWARD MAN CONSUMED,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE INWARD MAN RENEWED</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul s autobiography opens with tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This man who experienced Christ was a man under pressure beyond his strength.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He felt he was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He even had the sentence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He despaired of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What was the meaning of all this?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was simply the killing of the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The putting to death of Jesus was indoctrinated into his life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And that death of Christ was doing the killing work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was not only by the living Spirit within, but also through all the circumstances without.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why he said, For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is consumed, yet the inward man is renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The inward man is our spirit with Jesus living within it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our regenerated spirit with the indwelling Christ is the inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ lives with our inward man, but the problem is this: who is doing the living, He or we?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every day, from morning to night, by whom do we live?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do we live by our self, or by Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have heard many messages telling us to take Jesus as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But who is really our person?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We really have to pray, O Lord Jesus, forgive me, I didn t take You as my person very much today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I just didn t live by You.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>SOMETHING UNDER PRESSURE</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must realize that the indwelling of Christ is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is a daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we all have a daily experience of the indwelling Christ, it will enrich the church life and strengthen the church s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But we can never get into this experience by being taught.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It has to be accomplished under pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to be pressed out of measure, beyond our strength, that we may despair even of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We even need to have the sentence of death in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is God s purpose, because only death brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all have to be brought to the end. Then we will trust in the living God who raises the dead.</S>
