   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day God became a man to court man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Incarnation was God s courtship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a man courts a woman, he does not come to her in his original way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, he makes himself another person so that he can reach and gain her.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s courting was in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His courtship God did not remain in His original form; He became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Incarnation was a mother who gave Christ, her Son, a crown, a treasure, that is, His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Christ s human wife transformed into His divinity, we are a part of Christ s crown.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But on the positive side, it is to make an exhibition of Christ, to celebrate His glorious triumph.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That will be the Lamb glorified, exhibited, and celebrated triumphantly in an eternal marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we can see three ages: the church age, the kingdom age, and the eternal age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the church age we are betrothed to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our wedding day will be the kingdom age of one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then our marriage life will be in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These three ages are the story of the union of Christ s lovers with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The entire Bible is a condensed photo of this divine romance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Song of Songs is an abridged form of this romance, and the Bible is the entire revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After the lover of Christ has experienced the breaking of her self, her natural man, by the cross of Christ and after she has seen the flourishing riches of Christ s resurrection by which she was empowered and encouraged, she became a spiritual, steady person signified by the unshakable pillar of smoke, the same as God was to the children of Israel in their exodus from Egypt to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, she was linked to God in His moving for the accomplishment of His economy and united with Christ in His three prominent attainments:</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>1 His marvelous victory over all the enemies of God in the church age, signified by a bed in the night with sixty mighty men during the war.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She is the bed and Christ is the sleeper in the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This implies the union, the oneness, of the lover with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>2 His glorious triumph in His kingdom, signified by the palanquin in the day in the triumphant glory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>3 In His espousal and marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His espousal began from the time of incarnation, when incarnation as His mother crowned Him with His humanity, and goes through the church age in which all His believers are espoused to Him as virgins 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ s espousal and marriage life cover the church age, the kingdom age, and the eternal age.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the church age Christ has been fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the time of His espousal.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In 2 Corinthians Paul was fighting, and at the same time he was betrothing the believers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He fought to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even Paul s fighting was a part of God s dating.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we preach the gospel, we go out to represent God in His dating of His selected sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ s espousal also includes His wedding in the kingdom for one thousand years Rev 19:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Ultimately, His marriage life will be in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity 21:1 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The bed in the night signifying the church age , the palanquin in the day signifying the kingdom age , and the marriage life in the ages all refer to the one lover of Christ the Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be a corporate Shulammite, including all of God s chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the significance of moving with God and being united with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today we should be people linked to God in His moving in union with Christ and eventually united with Christ in His victory over the enemies in His celebration in the kingdom age and in His eternal marriage life, that is, the New Jerusalem.</S>
