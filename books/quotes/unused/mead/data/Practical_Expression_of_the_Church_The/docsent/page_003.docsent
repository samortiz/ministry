   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSATION OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 3:9-11, many great and significant terms are used because they are related to God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse nine, the word "fellowship" should be translated "dispensation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must all know the dispensation of God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This mystery has been hidden in God for generations from the beginning of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even before the foundation of the world, God was exceedingly clear regarding this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the creatures do not know this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It has been hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you could ask a tiger or a lion why they are here, they would tell you that they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And if you were to ask the university professors the meaning of life, I believe they all would answer that they simply do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But praise the Lord! this mystery has been made known.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know why God is in three Persons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know why the creation of the heavens and the earth and so many billions of items is necessary and why mankind was brought into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know because God has made known to us this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know what is the dispensation of the mystery which has been hidden in God from the beginning of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is all for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE DISPLAY OF GOD'S MANIFOLD WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With this eternal purpose of God, God's manifold wisdom is shown; and it is made known not only to man, but to the principalities and the powers in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God makes a show of His wisdom to all these angelic powers through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah, this is real wisdom!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is made known by the church, not by individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why we all must respect the church and realize how much we need the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as we are in the church, it is a glory to God and a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But as long as we are out of the church, it is a shame to God and a kind of boast to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are chosen, redeemed, saved, and regenerated not for heaven, but for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is God's aim.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is the center of God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GIFTED PERSONS AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 4:11-12 tells us that all the gifted persons the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are for the perfecting of the saints, that the building up of the church may be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is indeed regrettable that today so many so-called Christian workers, ministers and teachers are doing a work without much regard for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They only care for their work; they care little for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The work they are doing, in a sense, is frustrating, destroying and damaging the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the gifted persons must be for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be an apostle must be for the church.</S>
