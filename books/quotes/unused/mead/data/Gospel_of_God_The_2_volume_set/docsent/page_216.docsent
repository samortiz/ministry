   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, after reading so many verses, we can know the meaning of the verse, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The portion of Hebrews from chapters seven through ten, with the exception of chapter eight, says that the work of redemption, once finished, is eternally accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you do not want Christ, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ only offered Himself once as the sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do not want the redemption of Christ, but turn to Judaism, you will no longer find any other sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So, it is not a matter of being saved or perishing here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is said here is that the work of Christ is accomplished once.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you do not want this sacrifice, you will no longer have a second one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you take heed to the words "no longer," you will see what they are linked to.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The foregoing verses repeatedly mention the words "once for all," and the following verse says, "There no longer remains."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is equivalent to saying, for example, in chapter eight, "Here is the only pencil."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in chapter nine I repeat, "Here is the only pencil."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again in chapter ten I say, "Here is the only pencil."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After this I may explain, "If you do not want this pencil, or if you want to exchange this for another one, there will not be another one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Take this one if you want it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not want it, there is no other one left for you."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse does not mean that after receiving the knowledge of the truth, and then sinning willfully, you will not receive forgiveness anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not a matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a matter of the truth, a matter of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you forsake the Christian faith and look for another Savior, another sacrifice for sins, you will not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of the Jews at that time probably thought that if they rejected the Christian faith, they could still go back to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They could still go back to the altar and have the priests offer bulls and goats for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this would indicate another sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews during that time still had the priests and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their believing in Christ was different from our believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To them, they could choose to believe or not to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were not like the Gentile believers, who could only go back to idol worship if they did not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Gentile believers wanted God, they could choose God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if they did not want God, their only choice would be the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They did not have a third choice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the Jews, it was different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Jews thought that if they did not want Christ, they could still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they did not want Christ, they could still have redemption for sins, because they still could keep the priests and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they had more money, they could buy a bull.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they did not have that much money, they could still purchase a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostle was telling the Jews that Christ had already offered Himself once for all and had completed the eternal redemptive work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God had already abolished the old covenant together with the old sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the coming of Christ, the bulls and goats could atone for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But after the coming of Christ, the sacrifices of the bulls and goats could no longer take away their sins; these sacrifices have actually been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what Hebrews chapters seven through ten point out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God not only gave His Son as the sacrifice, but He abolished the sacrifices of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first half of chapter ten mentions that God does not take pleasure in bulls and goats, nor does He take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God prepared His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bulls and goats cannot redeem men from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only His Son can redeem us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sacrifice of bulls and goats in the Old Testament were only types and shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They refer to the Son of God as the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God said that the old covenant is a thing of the past; the types are over, and the reality is here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will no longer be acceptable if they reject God's Son, that is, if they reject the reality and offer up the types.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to God, there is only one sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Besides Him, there is no other sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hebrews 10:26 tells us that if we forsake Christ to look for another Savior, we will not find one.</S>
