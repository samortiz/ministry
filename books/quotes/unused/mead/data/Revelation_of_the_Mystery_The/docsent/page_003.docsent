   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE EXPLANATION OF GOD AND THE UPHOLDER OF ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A mystery is a story.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A story that can be clearly explained is not a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if there is a story that cannot be clearly explained, it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A mystery is a story that cannot be made known or explained in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is a mystery because although God is a story in the universe, no one can explain Him or describe Him thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is a mystery, and this mystery is in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus Christ is God's mystery, God's story.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you want to know God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must look at Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you want to know more concerning what God is all about?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must come and see Jesus, and then you will know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is God's story, God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has put all the fullness of His Godhead in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the embodiment of God, the depository of God, and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is not merely God, He is God's embodiment, depository, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is hidden, but Christ is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is inexplicable, but Christ is explained.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not understand God, who is a mystery, you only need to come and see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ explains God, who is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Christ is God expressed, God explained, and God spoken forth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Word is God explained and God coming forth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You cannot find God outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has put all that He is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's intention is to head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today God is still proceeding with this work of heading up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I stand, is it my two legs that support my body, or is it my head that holds up my body?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those with a shallow view will say that the feet and the legs uphold the body, but actually, according to the inner life, it is the head that holds up the body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone were to cut off your head, your body would immediately collapse and drop to the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apparently, when I stand, it is my legs that support my body, but actually it is my head that holds up my body, heading up all the members in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The head heads up and holds up the entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the universe is in a state of collapse and disarray because it does not acknowledge Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The United Nations is actually a group of quarreling nations because not one nation acknowledges Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day all the nations of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time Christ will head up all the nations as their Head in order for God to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all must see that God needs to obtain a corporate man to be His expression, and He also needs all things to be headed up in Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST WITH THE CHURCH AS THE UNIVERSAL, GREAT MAN</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This corporate man is the Body, and Christ is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ and this corporate man together form a universal, great man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Head of this universal man is Christ, and the Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This universal man is God's full manifestation, God's full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is God's eternal plan, God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to see that this is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our destiny is not to make a fortune, to have a good family, or to have longevity, but to be the members of the corporate man with Christ as the Head to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the meaning of the universe, and this is the meaning of human life.</S>
