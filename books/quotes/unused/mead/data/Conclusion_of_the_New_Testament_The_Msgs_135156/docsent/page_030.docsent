   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In a very real sense, Christ's sufferings have not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consider Paul's word in Colossians 1:24: "Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the Head, Christ's sufferings for the accomplishment of redemption are complete, but the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body are not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such sufferings are also called "His sufferings."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, in Colossians 1:24 Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of what is lacking of Christ's sufferings for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, Paul indicates in Philippians 3:10 that we still need to share in Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sufferings of Christ for His Body are still going on, and we need to share in them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ was on earth, He suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As those who follow Him, we must share in His sufferings for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would know Christ by experiencing the power of His resurrection, we must share His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a difference between those sufferings which are for our transformation and those which are for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul's word in 3:10 does not refer to suffering for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we compare 3:10 with Colossians 1:24, we shall see that the sufferings about which he is speaking in 3:10 are those which make up the lack of Christ's afflictions for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is when we suffer for the Body that we experience the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to experience Christ, we must be in the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot be in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we know the power of Christ's resurrection, the more we shall participate in the sufferings of Christ and thereby have the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To know Christ in these aspects is truly to experience Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is crucial for us to realize that Christ is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we experience Christ in His resurrection, we are infused with all the elements of resurrection, and this infusion enables us to partake of His sufferings for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we must have the dispensing of Christ's resurrection so that we may experience His cross, His death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is by knowing Christ's resurrection that we experience His death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The following stanza from a hymn written by A. B. Simpson indicates this:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>'Tis not hard to die with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When His risen life we know;</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When our hearts with joy o'erflow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His resurrection power</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has come to dwell in me,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And my heart is gladly going</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hymns, 481</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whereas Christ first passed through death and entered into resurrection, we first enjoy His resurrection and then we experience His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we know His resurrection, the more we shall be put into His death to share in the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul speaks of being called by God into the fellowship of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All believers desire to enter into the fellowship of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, in Philippians 3:10 Paul speaks of the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, something in which we are not naturally inclined to share.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the more we experience Christ's sufferings, the more we shall gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, the more we experience the cross, the more we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God gives us the cross, and the cross gives us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to have more experience of these things.</S>
