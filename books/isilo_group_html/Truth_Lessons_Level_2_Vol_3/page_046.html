The Head</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 11:3 the apostle Paul said, "I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man...and God is the head of Christ." Here the headship of Christ over every man pertains to individuals. In Ephesians 5:23 Paul also said that Christ is the Head of the church. Here the headship of Christ over His Body pertains to His Body. And in Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul said that Christ is the Head over all things. This pertains to all things. Therefore, Christ is the Head of every man, He is the corporate Head of the church, and He is the Head over all things that He may head up all things in Himself (Eph. 1:10).</P><P>Revelation 4 and 5 show us that Christ, the slain, resurrected, and ascended Lamb, is now in the heavens carrying out God's administration under God's headship. Satan takes the lead to rebel against God, and the whole earth is filled with rebellion. But in the midst of all this rebellion, Christ has gained a group of people who have been redeemed and baptized into the Triune God, and He has constituted them to be the Body of Christ. As the Body, they are freed from rebellion and are subjected under the headship of God. Just as Christ is in the heavens submitting to God's headship for the carrying out of the divine administration, so we the believers and the church, which is constituted with us, should also submit ourselves to Christ as the Head, honor Him as our Head, and express His submission to God's headship for the carrying out of the divine administration. When we thus take Christ as our Head and submit ourselves under His headship, we participate in and enjoy His headship.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
