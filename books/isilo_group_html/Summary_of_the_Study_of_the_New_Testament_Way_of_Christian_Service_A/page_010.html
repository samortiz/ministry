We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally. Actually, however, our service in the New Testament is not like this.<h2 class=head1>WORSHIPPING GOD ACCORDING TO HIS NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2><p>In John 4 the Samaritan woman talked with the Lord Jesus about worshipping God. Her talk was altogether natural. She said, &#8220;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&#8221; (v. 20). Then the Lord Jesus adjusted her by saying that the worship the Father God seeks after is absolutely different from this. God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth (v. 24). Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit. But it requires much understanding for us to realize what it is to worship God, the very Spirit, in truth.<p>Truth in John 4:24 refers to God&#8217;s truthfulness in which we participate. Then this truthfulness of God becomes our virtue in our human living. Actually, this is Christ lived out in our daily life. We worship God in such a Christ. Christ is the reality of the Triune God, and this reality is God&#8217;s truthfulness. This truthfulness in which we participate becomes our enjoyment. Then it becomes the virtue in our human living, which is Christ lived out in our daily life. Today we worship God in such a Christ and in our spirit. This is altogether not natural. According to my study and observation, many of the brothers in the recovery talk about how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach with a natural view. This is wrong.<p>If we want to see something concerning the biblical, God-ordained way to meet, to serve, to function, and to preach, we must forget what we think that we understand. We must let go of the things that we have heard in the past concerning the traditional way. How can we escape the tradition of the old, vast, and heavy system of Christianity? In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 through 7, the first blessing is the blessing of being poor in spirit (5:3). To be poor in spirit is to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation, but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. To the Jews, to be poor in spirit meant to empty out all the old knowledge of the Jewish religion, all the old knowledge concerning Moses, concerning Elijah, concerning the Old Testament temple, priesthood, offerings, etc. Everyone who was born as a Jew knew a lot. Then something new came embodied in this one person, Jesus. He told us that if we are going to be blessed with the kingdom of the heavens, we first have to empty ourselves in our spirit. We need to unload whatever we have in our spirit. Then we are empty, and the Spirit of truth can come in to unveil the things concerning this wonderful person, Christ, in an absolutely new way.<p>During Jesus&#8217; time on the earth, Judaism occupied the Jews and filled them up. In the same way today, Christianity is an old religion that has occupied us and is still filling us up. Whenever we talk about the things concerning God, we have many opinions, concepts, and views which are mostly according to tradition. When we talk about how to meet, we may have the concept that we need to be reverent and exercise a certain amount of fear toward God. Even the architecture of the cathedrals built in the Middle Ages-with the steep roofs, stain glass windows, and dark, dim atmosphere-was for creating fear toward God. In such places the people sit in pews, and in the Catholic cathedrals there are places to kneel down. This is the concept of worshipping God in Christianity.<p>In John 4, however, the Lord Jesus revealed that the way to worship God is to drink God as the living water (vv. 14, 24). Furthermore, the New Testament reveals the Lord&#8217;s table as the very central worship we render toward our Triune God. When the Lord established the table, did He tell us to kneel or to prostrate ourselves? What He told us to do was to take and eat the bread, which signifies the body He gave for us. He said to do this in remembrance of Him (1 Cor. 11:23-24). To worship the Lord, to remember Him, is to receive Him into us by eating Him. To remember Him is to eat Him, to masticate Him (John 6:57). To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. This is a new thought concerning the worship we render to the processed Triune God according to the New Testament economy of God. Instead of this new thought, the natural thought of worshipping God, in principle, is within us.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Summary of the Study of the New Testament Way of Christian Service &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
