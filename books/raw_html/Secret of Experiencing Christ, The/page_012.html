<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Jesus&#151;Jehovah the Savior</H2><P>As a man, this Christ is Jesus, which means "Jehovah the Savior" (Matt. 1:21; Luke 2:11). Jehovah is the Triune God, and He became Jesus. This means He became our Savior.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ&#151;God's Anointed One</H2><P>Christ is also the Christ (Matt. 16:16a), which means the anointed One. As God's Anointed, Christ's commission is to carry out God's purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Redeemer of All Created Things</H2><P>Christ is the Redeemer of all created things. Colossians 1:20 says that not only man, but also all things in the heavens and on the earth have been reconciled through Christ. Furthermore, Hebrews 2:9 says that Christ died to taste death on behalf of everything. This is clearly typified by the redemption of Noah's ark, in which not only eight persons, but all other living things created by God were saved (Gen. 7:13-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Peacemaker</H2><P>Christ is the Peacemaker, and as the Peacemaker He is our peace (Eph. 2:14-15). He has made peace between us and God and among all the different peoples. The Jews could never be one with the Gentiles, and the Germans could never be one with the British. But Christ died on the cross to abolish all the differences between the peoples (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:11). He made peace for all the different peoples so that we all can be one in Him. As a man, He is the Peacemaker.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Grain of Wheat</H2><P>Finally, as a man, Christ was a grain of wheat which brought forth many grains through death and resurrection. He told us in John 12:24 that He, as the grain of wheat, had to fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains. We the believers are these many grains to be the members of His Body (1 Cor. 10:17). Therefore, the issue of Christ's being a man is the producing of His Body.</P>
