   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. In His Victory over the Jebusites</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A number of matters in 2 Samuel 5:6-25 are evidence that God had established David and had exalted his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first of these is recorded in verses 6 through 8, where we see that David was established by God in his victory over the Jebusites.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>B. In the Building of Zion</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>as His Stronghold and of Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>and in His Becoming Greater and Greater</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>David's being established by God is seen also in the building of Zion as his stronghold and of Jerusalem v. 9 . Furthermore, "David became greater and greater; and Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him" v. 10 . This indicates that David had God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In serving the Lord, we need to have the assurance that we have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are really following the Lord for the fulfillment of His economy, we will certainly have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If in any matter we do not have the inner sense that the Lord is with us, we must be careful and consider our way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Saul first lost the presence of God 1 Sam 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That should have helped him to reconsider his way, but he did not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Lord's recovery, whenever we do anything, we must take care of the sense of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. In Hiram King of Tyre Supplying Him</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Materials for the Building of a Palace for Him</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hiram king of Tyre sent David materials and workmen for the building of a palace for him 2 Sam 5:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was a further strong evidence that David's being established as king over Israel was really of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such an assurance is very important and is necessary in our working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need to learn the lesson of caring for these two things: the inward presence of God and the outward confirmation in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. Begetting More Children,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Including Solomon, in Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to verses 13 through 16, in Jerusalem David begot more children, including Solomon.</S>
