<h1 class="title">FOUR LIFE EXERCISES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:8-9, 12; 3:17-18; 4:6-11; 5:9, 14-15; 6:4-10; 12:7-10; 13:3, 5</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning spiritual pursuit and life exercises. Although we have spoken much concerning this in the past, the saints still do not have a strong desire for the Lord. They have heard many messages, but they are still veiled, and there is still not much growth in life among us. Hence, we need further fellowship concerning the way of life. May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to have a heart for Him so that we would be unveiled to receive light and to walk on this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THAT CHRIST IS OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>Every form of life in the universe has its law, and God&rsquo;s life is not an exception. God&rsquo;s life will operate in us the same way that it operated in Paul two thousand years ago. In the Scripture Reading we listed many verses in which Paul speaks of himself. We hope to receive light from these verses and to see from his experience the basis for spiritual pursuit and life exercises. First, Paul&rsquo;s experience shows that a person who pursues life must know that Christ is in him as life. In 2 Corinthians 4:6 and 7 Paul says, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts...But we have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; According to these verses, the God who shined in Paul&rsquo;s heart became the treasure in him. This treasure is Christ, who became flesh and has entered into His believers as the life-giving Spirit. This is the first basic knowledge that we must have in the exercise of life. Unless we have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit to see that Christ has shined Himself into us to be our life and our treasure, we cannot pursue life.</p>
<p>In order to pursue life, we must first know that Christ is life in us (Col. 3:4). Paul&rsquo;s word to the Corinthians confirms this: &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:5). The first item in the exercise of spiritual life is to see that Christ is in us to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing High and Profound Revelations<br />
as Well as Small and Simple Experiences</h2>
<p>The truth and light in the Bible concerning being in Christ and concerning the cross are always high and profound, but what the Bible says concerning the experiences of being in Christ and of the cross is not so high or profound. In Ephesians Paul says that Christ is far above all, that He has been given to be Head over all things to the church, and that the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:21-23). In Colossians he says that Christ is all things and that Christ is in all things (1:15-19). However, in 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul does not speak of his experience as being high or profound. Second Corinthians speaks of being in Christ and of the cross. In comparison to Ephesians and Colossians, however, 2 Corinthians appears to be rather simple and plain. In 2 Corinthians we do not see the Christ who is all in all filling us, nor do we see Christ being all things and being in all things. On the contrary, here Paul says that Christ is the treasure in earthen vessels so that the power of God can be manifested in the weak (4:7).</p>
<p>According to church history, there was a group of people who focused on experience. Their writings do not contain high revelations or profound light but seem simple and insignificant. We must not treasure only the messages on the all-inclusiveness of Christ or His all-inclusive death on the cross. The death of Christ is indeed all-inclusive, but it is of little value if we do not die. Christ is all-inclusive, but what does this mean if we do not experience His all-inclusiveness? Paul did not write only Ephesians and Colossians; he also wrote 2 Corinthians. In Ephesians he writes that Christ fills all things and that the church is His fullness (1:23). In Colossians Paul says that all things cohere in Christ and that He is in all things (1:15-19). In 2 Corinthians Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels&rdquo; (4:7). In this verse Paul applies Jesus Christ to himself. Paul was a vessel, but the treasure in him was universal. These verses show that when speaking of revelation and light, the Bible presents something high and profound, but what it says concerning experience is not so high or profound.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we need to see something high and profound, but on the other hand, we need experiences that are simple and small. Otherwise, our experiences can be false. If you leap and praise every day and proclaim, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Christ is the One who fills all,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The death of the cross is all-inclusive,&rdquo; I would question whether this is real. In Ephesians and Colossians Paul saw the Christ who is in the universe and in all things. This light is very high. However, in 2 Corinthians Paul experienced the Christ who is in an earthen vessel. He had small and simple experiences of Christ. His living in poverty was in Christ, his fasting was in Christ, his suffering of reproach was in Christ, his being praised was in Christ, and his being in want was in Christ; whether through evil report or through good report, he experienced Christ (6:4-10). This is Christ in our experience.</p>
<p>Some have asked me how God can care about so many trivial things: He cares about the shoes and clothes we wear, whether we watch movies, and how we socialize. The general concept about God is that He is too great to be involved in the trivial and petty matters of our living. We must be clear that the revelation of Christ is high and profound, but our experience is often simple and small. If we cannot experience Christ in small things, the light we have seen is questionable.</p>
<p>This is true not only of our experience of Christ but also of our enjoyment of the things in the universe. For example, the ocean is filled with water, but we would drown if all the water in the ocean were poured on us. We can receive water only one sip at a time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
