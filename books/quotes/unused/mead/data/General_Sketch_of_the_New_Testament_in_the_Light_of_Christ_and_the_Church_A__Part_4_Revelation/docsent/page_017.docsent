   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Temple Measured and the Court Cast Out</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 11:1 says, And there was given to me a reed like a rod, and someone said, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 21:15 mentions a golden reed for measuring, but there it is not like a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A rod is used for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter eleven there is still the need of judgment because of the sinful and worldly things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter twenty-one, however, there is no need of a rod because there is nothing left to judge in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To measure something is with the intention of taking possession of it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the reed in 11:1 is for measuring with judgment in order to possess.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The temple of God mentioned in verse 1 is the temple in the heavens, and the altar is not the altar of burnt offering but the incense altar, because it is with the temple, not outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The measuring of the temple of God and the incense altar in the heavens indicates that during the great tribulation the heavens will be preserved from being damaged, because in that three and a half years Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 2 continues, And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The outer court of the temple signifies the earthly temple and Jerusalem on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That it is not measured means that God will give it up and will not take possession of it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The holy city, Jerusalem, will be given up to the Gentiles to be trampled for forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The insertions in the book of Revelation speak about matters close in time to the events in the nearby chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why we say that the last half of the last week, the forty-two months mentioned in verse 2, will begin with the sixth seal, which is very close to the time of the first five trumpets in chapters eight and nine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Two Witnesses</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 3 says, And I will cause My two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the ancient Jewish calendar, a month had thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Three and a half years, that is, forty-two months times thirty, is a thousand two hundred and sixty days, as in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the last half of the last week of this age, the two witnesses will come to prophesy, clothed in sackcloth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Old Testament, for people to put on sackcloth means that they are mourning, not joyful Isa 22:12; Joel 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 11:4 says, These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The olive trees and the lampstands are seen in Zechariah 4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The two olive trees produce oil for the lamps of the lampstand, so they are called the two sons of oil v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Bible students are of two schools of opinion concerning these two sons of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first school says that these two witnesses are Enoch and Elijah, whereas the second school says that they are Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All Bible students agree concerning Elijah, but they disagree whether the other is Enoch or Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should understand who the two witnesses are according to the record of what they will do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some things they will do are what Moses did in Egypt, and other things correspond to what Elijah did.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition, Revelation 11:4 says that the two witnesses stand before the Lord of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the mountain where the Lord was transfigured, Moses and Elijah came to stand before the Lord Matt 17:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, after Moses death, Satan contended with Michael for the body of Moses Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Michael must have sought to preserve the body of Moses for a definite reason, which was for him to appear on the Mount of Transfiguration and to be one of the two witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the great tribulation, God will send Moses and Elijah back to give a strong testimony for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 5 through 7 say, And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Shutting heaven is what Elijah did 1 Kings 17:1 , and turning water to blood is what Moses did Exo 7:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The beast here is the Antichrist, the man of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is not an ordinary person but an extraordinary one coming up out of the bottomless pit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This beast will make war with the two witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 11:8 says, And their corpses will be on the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This great city is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By this time the earthly Jerusalem will become full of sin like Sodom and worldly like Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verses 9 and 10 continue, And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses for three and a half days, and they will not allow their corpses to be placed in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Three and a half days is similar to the three days in which the Lord was in the tomb Luke 24:46 and the four days in which Lazarus was dead John 11:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the two witnesses are troublemakers, people will celebrate when they are killed and will leave their bodies on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation 11:11-12 says, And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that the two witnesses will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then verse 13 says, And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Literally, men in verse 13 is names of men, or as Robert Govett says, men of names, implying people of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The last half of the last week, that is, the three and a half years, will be the period of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During this time these two strongest of witnesses will come to give a strong testimony to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They will be killed by Antichrist, resurrected miraculously as a testimony to the whole earth, and raptured in a special rapture to the heavens.</S>
