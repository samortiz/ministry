The two Epistles to the Thessalonians were written in the early days, while Paul was still on his second journey of ministry
According to Acts, Paul worked there for three Sabbaths, for about three weeks, not long after his visit to Philippi
Because the church in Thessalonica was so young, Paul's Epistles to the Thessalonians are more or less to those in a childhood stage
Some of what Paul says to the Thessalonians is different from what he says to other churches that were more experienced
It is worthwhile for us to study 1 and 2 Thessalonians in order to know the situation and condition of a young church
These Epistles are very precious, for they render us particular help concerning the young Christian life and church life
Because this Epistle was written to young believers in 11 Paul simply says Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians
It is a particular characteristic of Paul's writing to emphasize the organic union of the believers with the Triune God
Although 1:1 is written in a simple way, it nevertheless includes Paul's characteristic reference to the organic union
On the one hand, the church in Thessalonica was of the Thessalonians; on the other hand, this church was in God the Father
Sinners can be members of a secular organization, but they cannot be components of the church of the living God
It is very significant that in 1:1 Paul inserts the title Father after God and the title Lord before Jesus Christ
He still responds when we call 'Jesus' instead of 'Lord Jesus,' for He realizes that actually we are calling on Him as Lord
It implies that Christ, God's anointed One, is bringing us into the riches of God and is accomplishing everything with us for God
The church is a group of human beings who have been born of God and who have been brought into the organic union with Christ
The faith, the love, and the hope in 1:3 depict the structure of the genuine Christian life, constructed with these elements
Love enjoys the things received and realized by faith and partaken of by hope for nourishing ourselves building up others and expressing God
Such a life originates not from the ability of the believer's natural being, but from the infusion of what God is, in whom they believe
It is marvelous that the Thessalonian believers could live such a life through the apostle's short ministry of less than one month
Do not hold the concept that, as you preach the full gospel, others will not be able to understand what you are saying
We should not have the wrong concept that the Lord will come immediately, so that we need not do anything for the long run
The more we read the book of 1 Thessalonians, the more we realize that it truly was written to young believers
The apostles knew that the brothers beloved by God were chosen in such a manner by God for the fulfillment of His heart's desire
If he accepts the gospel willingly in a positive way, that acceptance is a sign, an indicator, that he surely has been selected by God
We all need to see that in eternity past we were selected by God and that our being in the church today is a sign of this eternal selection
We all should learn that to preach the gospel we must preach in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance
In verse 5 power, the Holy Spirit, and much assurance are linked to the words 'what kind of men we were among you for your sake'
A careless person, one who does not live Christ, cannot preach the gospel in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance
To preach the gospel in this way, we must first live Christ and have a manner of life to match the power, the Holy Spirit, and the assurance
The Thessalonians as new believers became imitators of the apostles, and then they became imitators of the Lord
In verses 7 and 8 Paul says, 'So that you became a pattern to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia
They imitated the pattern and then they became a pattern to the believers in the Roman provinces of Macedonia and Achaia
The new believers will accept this word and follow us to follow the Lord, thereby becoming a pattern for other believers
They should experience Him not only as the object of worship, but also as the all-inclusive Supplier who lives in them
In the same way, everyone worships something in order to satisfy the hunger in his spiritual stomach, the spirit
When many pursue certain forms of worldly amusement, they act without restraint, seeming even to forget their own names
It is somewhat easy to turn others to God from sin, but it is much more difficult to turn them to God from idols
The fact that God controls us and directs us, even in small things such as our thoughts and motives, is a proof that He is living
We must live a life which bears the testimony that the God we worship and serve is living in the details of our daily life
Even some of us who have been in the recovery for years still need to be helped to make up things lacking in the Christian life
We all need to see the difference between understanding the Word in a natural way and understanding it in a spiritual way
Although 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written to new believers, in these books a number of profound terms are used
Of the many Epistles written by Paul, only these two have this expression, the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
The God revealed in the New Testament is not merely God the Creator; He is God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
Although the church in Thessalonica was a new church, the Thessalonians nevertheless had to realize that the church is in God
Those in this young church needed to see that the church is in the Triune God, in the very God who is our Father and our Lord
We may think that we know what it means to turn from idols, to serve a living and true God, and to wait for His Son from the heavens
To say that God has chosen us unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit is to utter something great and profound
The sister went on to say that this proves that God is living, for He had prepared someone to help her in that situation
Do you think that Paul's concept of the living God here is the same as that of the sister who gave this testimony?
When Paul speaks of the living God, does he mean that God will send someone to help you when you are in trouble?
If we read only 1 Thessalonians, it may be difficult to find out what is Paul's understanding of the living God
If we read the other books written by Paul, we shall see that for him the living God is the God who is now living in us
Now, after the cross and the resurrection, the God whom we serve is no longer merely in the heavens, for He is now living in us
Even those who have been in the Lord for years still testify only that the God they serve is objectively living
Because the living God in her did not agree, she did not show such an unpleasant expression toward her husband
In these verses faith is not only subjective, referring to the saints' believing, but also objective, referring to what they believe in
You tell them the story of the gospel, relating how God loves them and how He sent His Son to be a man and to die on the cross for them
We may use photography as an illustration of how, through faith, God is brought into us, and we are brought into the organic union with Him
If you keep these terms in mind, eventually light will come and, gradually, you will have the proper spiritual understanding
In reading or studying any part of the Bible, it is always necessary to find out what was in the spirit of the writer
We know that He was born in Jewish territory, lived in that region for thirty-three and a half years, and eventually died on the cross
In verse 5 Paul points out to the Thessalonians that the gospel came to them not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit
As a battery is the embodiment of electricity so in the spiritual realm the Word of God a divine battery is the embodiment of the Triune God
He must also have told them how one day God the Son became incarnate, how He was born in a manger and given the name Jesus
In this way an organic union took place, and the Thessalonians came to be in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
In 1:1 the phrase 'in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ' not only qualifies the church, but also qualifies the Thessalonians
Alford did not use the expression organic union, but he speaks of communion, which means fellowship and a kind of co-union
The believers at Thessalonica, being in the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, were no longer heathen or Jewish
To serve a living God indicates that we are in God the Father, and to wait for the Son indicates that we are in our Lord Jesus Christ
As we have pointed out, objective faith denotes that in which we believe, and subjective faith denotes the action of believing
Now when the word of the Lord is sounded out, it is not merely an objective word; it is also your subjective faith
In this way we have the complete structure of a holy life for the church life the work of faith the labor of love and the endurance of hope
Although the expression the church life cannot be found in these Epistles the church is mentioned emphatically at the beginning of each book
Corinthians begins in a somewhat different way: 'Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God'
Paul does not use any titles to refer to himself; he does not speak of himself as a slave of Christ or as an apostle
He simply says, 'Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ'
On the one hand, the church is of certain persons; on the other hand, it is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
There Paul says, 'To the church of God which is in Corinth,' describing the church as being in a particular place
It is very positive to say that the church is in God the Father, but it is not positive to say that the church is of the Thessalonians
There is a church in San Francisco today, the church of the San Franciscans in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
If we would understand this, we need to ask a very important question: What is the source of a holy life for the church life?
Those who are thoughtful may wonder why this title uses the term 'The Triune God' when this expression is not found in 1 Thessalonians 1
Such careful readers may wonder how we can speak, again from 1 Thessalonians 1, of the Triune God embodied in the Word
Verse 5 says, 'Because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance'
In verse 6 Paul points out that the Thessalonians 'accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
The Thessalonians in particular did not have a good name; instead, they had a reputation for sinfulness, uncleanness, and immorality
As a result, in that evil city there came to be a church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Today we are neither heathen, nor Jewish; we are the church people in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
The church is composed of those who are no longer Gentiles or Jews, for we all now are in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
In this book we have the revelation that the church is not only of God and of Christ but also in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
In verses 1 and 3 Paul speaks of God the Father; in verse 10, of the Son; and in verses 5 and 6, of the Holy Spirit
In this message we shall go on to consider, also from 1 Thessalonians 1, how this Triune God is ministered to us
You became imitators of us and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
The fact that the gospel was preached in the Holy Spirit indicates that the Spirit is the One who transmits the things of God into us
God the Father selected us, God the Son accomplished redemption to deliver us, and God the Spirit transmits all the divine things to us
When others hear the presentation of such an attractive One, they will appreciate what you are saying and receive your word
By means of this relationship and union we begin our Christian life, a life of holiness, a holy life for the church life
In that verse work does not refer to an activity or a task that we do; it refers to particular deeds in our behavior
The unbeliever accepts the word, faith is produced in him, and through this faith he is born of God and put into Christ
For this reason, when a new believer preaches Christ to his wife, the faith within him may enlighten him concerning his attitude toward her
Before a certain person was saved, he may have been unkind to others and harsh in many aspects of his behavior
Both 1 Thessalonians 1:1 and 2 Thessalonians 1:1 tell us that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
The longer description of the church contains three names not found in the shorter: the Father, the Lord, and Jesus
By reading the New Testament we realize that the first basic matter concerning the divine titles is the revelation of the name of the Father
When the Lord Jesus came and lived on earth in the flesh, what He mainly did was reveal the name of the Father to His disciples
As applied to the Lord Jesus, the title Lord implies incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
In order for Jehovah to become our Savior and our salvation, it was necessary for Him to pass through a long process
Through the steps of His process, He, as the Christ, has fulfilled this commission and has accomplished God's purpose
If we read carefully, we shall realize that 1 Thessalonians 1:1 and 2 Thessalonians 1:1 are very similar, but are not exactly the same
Thessalonians 1:1 says, 'Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ'
Some who were once immoral were saved and regenerated and composed the church in their locality in the Triune God
We have one of the many instances where what the Bible does not say is just as important as what it does say, if not more so
Why did Paul not say 'the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit'?
Eventually we shall see that there is a good reason for Paul to mention the Father and Christ the Son, but not the Spirit
The reason they do not see that the church is in the Triune God is that they are veiled by traditional concepts concerning the church
According to the Bible, there is no such thing as the church merely in God, but there is the church in the Triune God
In the New Testament the first main step regarding the revelation of the Triune God is the revelation of the name of the Father
Caesarea Philippi was far from the holy city with the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled everyone's thought
According to verse 14, they said, 'Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets'
As we know Peter receiving the revelation from the Father answered and said to the Lord Jesus You are the Christ the Son of the living God
In the New Testament we first have the revelation of the name of the Father and then the revelation of the Son of God
The revelation of the Triune God requires the incarnation of Christ, the Lord's human living, and His crucifixion and resurrection
In crucifixion, He accomplished redemption, the termination of the old creation, and the destruction of Satan and death
The church is in the processed Triune God, the One who has become the life-giving Spirit with the Father and the Son
The very God in whom the church is today is the processed Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
For the church to be in God the Father implies that the church is in God's purpose, plan, selection, and predestination
Imagine what would happen if all Christians gave up their own purposes and plans and had only one initiator and originator
Those who take a name such as these indicate by doing so that they are not the church in the Lord Jesus Christ
Whenever we make such a claim, however, we need to check to see whether we are still holding to our culture or disposition
As long as you want others to sympathize with you, that is an indication that in your experience you are not buried with Christ
All the old things, the negative things-sin, the flesh, the self, the old man, the natural life, Satan, death-have been terminated
Rather, He executes, carries out, what the Father has planned and originated and what the Son has accomplished
We all must see that everything the Father has planned and everything the Son has accomplished is now in the Spirit and with the Spirit
For this reason we may say that the Father is in the Son and that the Son is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us
We have emphasized the fact that in 1:1 Paul says that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Although we have emphasized the Father, the Lord, and Jesus, we have not explained fully what it means for the church to be in Christ
Christ is a divine title that mainly denotes the Lord's experience, position, life, and actions after His resurrection
If we speak of Jesus according to the biblical use of this name, we mainly refer to His experience between incarnation and resurrection
It is much more common for Christians today to say Praise the Lord than it was twenty years ago when the Lords recovery came to this country
Our Christ is not only the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven; He is also the One who has descended and entered into our spirit
In the next verse the Lord spoke about the many abodes in the Father's house and about going to prepare a place for them
After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to His disciples to be with them forever, so that they were not left orphans
He appeared to the disciples in the form of pneuma, and He told them to receive the holy pneuma, the holy breath
We also have received the Lord Jesus Christ as the holy breath, the holy pneuma, the life-giving Spirit, and now He is actually in us
The fact that we may not be at all excited about this may indicate that we do not realize that Christ is in us
For the Lord Jesus to be the Messiah, the Christ, the anointed One, means that God's Spirit was poured upon Him
He hears how the Lord Jesus died for him, has been resurrected, and is waiting for him to receive Him by calling, 'O Lord Jesus'
The Lord can respond so quickly to our calling on Him because in resurrection He is now the life-giving Spirit
To be in the Lord Jesus Christ means on the one hand that we are terminated and are no longer in the old creation
We need to be impressed with the fact that to be in Christ is to be in resurrection, in the Spirit, in power, and on the throne
Before we go on to see that to be in Christ is also to be in the kingdom and glory, we need to emphasize the crucial matter of life
It is indeed a tragedy that, under the influence of religion, so many Christians have been distracted from growing in resurrection life
The church today is in Christ, the One who in His resurrection has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
According to both 1 Thessalonians 1:1 and 2 Thessalonians 1:1, the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
What John 14 speaks about is not heavenly mansions; rather, it speaks of abodes, abiding places, in a divine Person, in God the Father
The Lord Jesus was telling His disciples that through His death and resurrection He would prepare the way to bring them into the Father
The Lord Jesus has been there for more than nineteen hundred years, and still He hasn't finished the building of this mansion
A number of other Christian writers have said that, in Christian experience, Christ is identical to the Spirit
In doctrine or in theology it is very difficult to explain how the second of the Trinity, the Son, can be identical to the third, the Spirit
The Spirit certainly does not contain death, but it does include the effectiveness of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
Married brothers and sisters may be concerned about how to have a good marriage or how to be a proper husband or wife
We have pointed out that to be in Jesus Christ means that everything negative and everything of the old creation has been terminated
Power, strength, might, authority, the throne, holiness, righteousness-all the divine virtues are involved with this resurrected Christ
We have placed a strong emphasis on the fact that, according to 1:1, the church is an entity in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Now let us go on to consider 2:12: 'That you should walk worthily of God, Who calls you into His own kingdom and glory'
Our daily life must actually be God Himself, since only God can be worthy of God, match God, or compare with God
Whereas 1:1 speaks of the church in God the Father, many Christians instead speak of the church in God the Almighty
As the Almighty, God does not have any life relationship with you, and you may not have anything to do with Him
The President may be wealthy, and your father may be poor, but certainly you love your father more than you love the President
If he expresses God daily in the office, his fellow workers will realize that there is something unusual about him
From the context of 2:12 we can see that being called into God's kingdom and glory is related to walking worthily of God
When we walk worthily of God, there is with us a particular kind of atmosphere, and this atmosphere is God's kingdom
If today's Christians would walk worthily of God, would walk in a way that expresses Him, the kingdom would come
If you visit a brother's house and find him and his wife glowing, shining, and flowing, you would see the expression of God, God's glory
In 3:12 Paul says, 'And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you'
No matter how many believers there may be in the church-fifty, five hundred, or five thousand-all the saints should love one another
If we truly are a church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, the love we have for one another will increase and abound
Only when we are in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ are we truly separated unto God from everything other than God
Verse 23 says that God will preserve our spirit and soul and body without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
Wherever we may be-at school, at work, at home, or with our neighbors-we shall eventually be fully boxed in to God
In 1 Thessalonians we have seen certain qualifications of the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
As we have pointed out, we should not regard the kingdom and the glory as only something for the future and not for our experience today
We need to increase and abound in love, and we need to be fully sanctified, entirely boxed in, by the Triune God
Verse 14 says, 'To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ'
Of emphasizing the supernatural and the miraculous, Paul takes his living as a factor for the preaching of the gospel
Throughout the centuries the human mind has been interested in things that are fantastic, miraculous, and supernatural
Such a life is characterized by turning to God from idols, serving the living God, and waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus
Our goal, hope, and expectation are not related to things on earth, but are focused on the coming back of the Lord Jesus
Because the apostles rendered such a care to the new believers, the apostles will eventually receive a reward from the Lord
Because many came to believe in the Lord Jesus through the apostles, a church was raised up in less than a month
They were bold not in themselves, but in God, even after they had been outrageously treated by the Philippians
Their speaking, the preaching of the gospel, was not of themselves to please men, but was of God to please Him
When we are put to the test, we shall see what we really are and discover that in ourselves we are not honest, faithful, or trustworthy
Because the apostles had been entrusted with the gospel, they spoke not as pleasing men, but as pleasing God, who proves our hearts
May we be able to say that God is our witness that we do not speak words of flattery or have any pretext for covetousness
How much we shall be used by the Lord and how long our usefulness will last depends on whether we seek glory of men
Those who are believers and also those who are not believers may consider the leading ones, the elders, or the apostles as dignitaries
If we follow this pattern, we shall kill a deadly disease germ in the Body of Christ, the germ of assuming a position
In verse 10 Paul continues You are witnesses and God how holily and righteously and blamelessly we conducted ourselves with you who believe
Holily refers to conduct toward God, righteously to conduct toward men, and blamelessly to all-God, men, and Satan
Verse 11 says, 'Even as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father his own children, entreating you and consoling and testifying'
Verse 12 indicates that walking worthily of God is related to entering into His kingdom and being ushered into His glory
If we would be a proper pattern for young saints, our greed must be dealt with, and money matters must be under our feet
We should never speak words of flattery, we should never have any pretext, and we should never seek glory for ourselves
If you consider the situation among believers today, you will realize that many Christians have no sense of direction
We need to be a pattern to others and foster them, cherishing them as mothers and exhorting them as fathers to walk worthily of God
Paul emphasizes the apostles' coming, their preaching and teaching of the Word, and how the new believers accepted this word
Rather, in verse after verse, Paul mentions his manner of life, his way of preaching, and his being a pattern to the believers
Most Christian workers lack the concept that their work should not mainly be a work of teaching, but should be a work of fostering
We may also say that he is watering, nourishing, and cherishing the tender young plants so that they may grow in life
They advise others not to speak of how they have repented, believed in the Lord, received grace, and have been saved
These teachers insist strongly that we should preach only the Lord Jesus and teach the Bible, but should never say anything about ourselves
By reading the biographies of saints throughout the ages, we nourish ourselves and experience a kind of fostering
How could the Thessalonians have imitated the churches in Judea if they had not heard anything concerning them?
Paul points out that the Jews did not want the Thessalonians to hear the word of the apostles in order to be saved
Would you not be touched if they said that without you life is meaningless, that they are living on earth only for you?
Thessalonians 2:12 does not say that God has called us to heaven, but says that He has called us with the goal of entering into His kingdom
What a glory it would be to any Christian worker for the ones he has fostered to be matured at the Lord's coming back!
Its establishment involves the three main aspects of its structure; that is, it involves faith, love, and hope
In 3:1 Paul says, 'Wherefore, when we could bear it no longer, it seemed good for us to be left in Athens alone'
The apostles had been bereaved of the Thessalonian believers in presence and were intensely eager to see them again
In speaking of the Thessalonians faith Paul returns to the matter of the structure of a holy life for the church life covered in chapter one
Concerning this, Paul says in verse 3, 'That no one be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed for this'
If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good to us according to God's purpose in His appointment
The reason for this difficulty is that in the New Testament there are two aspects of faith, the objective aspect and the subjective aspect
It is because God's economy is so profound and rich in its content that we dare not say that the objective faith has been perfected among us
We need to see that our objective faith includes the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ as the content of God's economy
We still need to lay hold of more of the all-inclusive Christ, more of Christ as the content of our objective faith
We have seen a vision of the indwelling Christ, and we have no choice except to believe that He is actually in us
Because we have seen a revelation regarding the content of God's economy, we cannot help believing in what we have seen
We have been infused with the ability to believe, and now we have subjective faith, the inward action of believing
Whenever someone loses sight of the contents of God's economy, the subjective faith, the believing action within him, also diminishes
The ability within us to believe is always a product, a result, an issue, of having a proper view of God's economy
In the meetings of the church and of the ministry, it is as if we are all watching a heavenly television to see more of God's economy
Paul knew that once we lose sight of the contents of God's economy, we shall be shaken and removed from the line of faith
Verse 7 says, 'Because of this we were encouraged over you, brothers, in all our necessity and affliction, through your faith'
The sound condition of the believers is always an encouragement to God's fellow-workers, who work with them and bear them as a burden
A calamity puts people into a position of having an urgent need for necessary supplies such as food, water, clothing, and housing
Even though the apostles were in necessity, in distress, they were encouraged over the Thessalonians through their faith
If the young believers you are working with stand firm in the Lord, that standing will certainly minister the life supply to you
When Paul wrote the book of 1 Thessalonians, the believers at Thessalonica probably had been Christians for less than a year
Having a greater view of Christ, your objective faith will be broadened and, spontaneously, your subjective faith will be increased
In 3:1-10 Paul has mainly dealt with faith as the first item of the structure of a holy life for the church life
Following faith is love, which issues from faith and works together with faith as an indication of growth in life
How beautiful are the footsteps of the apostles in their carrying out of this One's ministry for the fulfilling of His purpose!
The establishing of the believers' hearts blameless issues from faith and love, as mentioned in the preceding verses
The establishing of a holy life for the church life is thus related to its structure composed of faith, love, and hope
We shall help them to realize that, as genuine Christians, they already have the structure of a holy life for the church life
The Epistle of 1 Thessalonians was written to new believers, to those who had been in the Lord less than a year
For this reason, in 3:10 he expressed his desire to come to the Thessalonians and perfect what was lacking in their faith
To be sure, these new believers were lacking in many aspects of the faith revealed in Romans, Ephesians, and Galatians
Those who are working with young people or with new believers can receive from this book both a direction and an outline to follow
People would never have a chance to indulge themselves in this lust if they did not have some form of social life
In order to have the church life we cannot avoid having a communal life a social life in which we have considerable contact with one another
The facts prove that Christian workers in particular are often snared by fornication because they have so much contact with others
In the same principle, fornication is dealt with in 1 Thessalonians 4 because of the environment of Thessalonica
Knowing that it would be difficult for the church in that city to avoid problems with fornication, Paul issued a warning regarding it
After Paul has completed his task of fostering and establishing a holy life for the church life, he changes his tone
Other sins may not damage us subjectively, but fornication damages our body, contaminates our entire being, and makes us utterly unholy
To keep or preserve man's vessel in sanctification and honor, not in passion of lust, is the safeguard against committing fornication
Man was created for God's purpose with a high standing, and marriage was ordained by God for the propagation of man to fulfill God's purpose
We must know how to possess, keep, preserve, our own body in sanctification toward God and in honor before man
In order to be such persons, we must absolutely abstain from fornication and not give ground for suspicion in this matter
According to verse 5, we should not possess our body in the passion of lust as the nations who do not know God
Literally, the Greek word rendered 'overstep' means to overpass limits, that is, overreach, transgress, go beyond
In verse 6 Paul also says that the Lord is the avenger concerning these things, things such as overstepping and taking advantage of others
If you reject it, you are not rejecting me, but you are rejecting God, the One who gave His Holy Spirit to you'
If we fall into fornication, we reject this indwelling Spirit who is working within us to sanctify us unto God
The words 'brotherly love' are a translation of the Greek word philadelphia, composed of phileo, to love, and adelphos, brother
Those who are too interested in others' affairs should be ambitious to be quiet and attend to their own affairs
In the way we drive, in the way we wear our hair, in the clothes we wear, and in all other things, we shall want to be becoming
The more we read 1 Thessalonians and consider its contents, the more we realize that this Epistle was written to new believers
The book of Ephesians contains many profound terms: the mystery of Christ, the Body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills all in all
He tells us that we have been taught of God to love one another, and then he encourages us to abound in this love
Paul exhorts us to be ambitious to be quiet, not to be busybodies, to work with our hands, and to attend to our own affairs
The answer to these questions is that if we take care of sanctification, brotherly love, and walking becomingly, we shall be perfect
We all need to take care of our sanctification, of our love for others, and of having a proper and becoming walk
He knew that the believers had been in the Lord less than a year, and therefore he wrote them in a very practical way
Concerning this matter, details are revealed in other books of the New Testament, such as Matthew and Revelation
What he says here can be compared to an elementary school teacher giving his students some basic principles of mathematics
He wants to impress them with the fact that the Christian life, which is a holy life for the church life, has a hope
To interpret the verse in this way is to neglect the first half of the verse, where we are told that Jesus died and rose
The fact that verse 16 says that the dead in Christ shall rise indicates that they must be in some place other than heaven
In verse 16 the Greek words rendered 'cry of command' may also be translated shout of command, as a signal for assembling
Some among us may still hold the concept that saints who have died have gone to heaven and are now there with the Lord Jesus
The sinners now in the section of torment in Hades are awaiting the final judgment, which will take place at the white throne of God
They will not rise up to heaven; rather, they will rise up and then be caught up together with the living saints
According to verse 17, those who are living will be caught up at the same time with them to a meeting of the Lord
Why does Paul add the clause 'who remain unto the coming of the Lord' in verse 15 and the clause 'who remain' in verse 17?
The rapture of the overcomers will take place before the last three and a half years, a period known as the great tribulation
Regarding time, these two raptures are different: one takes place before the great tribulation, and the other, at the end of the tribulation
According to 1 Thessalonians 4, the rapture of those who are alive and remain will be to the clouds in the air
We have pointed out that the Greek word for 'coming' in verse 15 is parousia, the same word as used in Matthew 24:3
Probably the Lord will stay in the air concealed by the cloud for a period of time, possibly more than three years
At that time the decision will be made by Him concerning who will join Him in the millennial kingdom and who will not
At His coming back, the saints who have died will rise up from Paradise and the tomb to be caught up with those who are alive and remain
If this book concluded at the end of chapter four, and if we did not have 5:1-11, some believers may be misled
Because they isolate 4:13-18 from the rest of this Epistle, Christians have been misled or even drugged in their mentality
Verse 1 says, 'But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you'
In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, 'For you yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night'
The fact that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night indicates that its coming is kept secret and that it will come suddenly
In verse 6 he exhorts us to watch and be sober: 'So then, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober'
In verse 7 Paul says, 'For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk, are drunk in the night'
The breastplate is of faith and love, covering and protecting our heart and spirit according to God's righteousness
Faith, love, and hope are the three basic structures of the genuine Christian life as depicted in 1 Thessalonians 1:3
Love is related to our emotion, another part of our heart ; and hope is related to our understanding-a function of our mind
At the beginning of this Epistle, the apostle praised the believers' work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope
At the conclusion of the Epistle, he exhorts them to keep these spiritual virtues covered and protected by fighting for them
If we would protect these aspects of the basic structure of a holy life for the church life, we need to be watchful and sober
We have pointed out that in chapter four Paul comforts us with this hope, telling us that at the Lord's coming we shall be raptured
The fact that watchfulness is related to fighting is confirmed by Paul's mention of the breastplate and helmet in verse 8
If we grasp this thought, we shall have in large measure the proper understanding of what it means to be watchful
According to our understanding, to be watchful is simply to look out for something, for example, to watch our step as we are walking
In these verses to be watchful is to remember that we are in a battle, that we are fighting and are surrounded by enemies
When the Lord Jesus comes and we are raptured, we shall be saved from the slavery of corruption of the old creation
Certain slogans on bumper stickers concerning the Lord's coming indicate that many Christians are drugged and in a stupor
We have emphasized the fact that Paul wrote the Epistle of 1 Thessalonians in an elementary way, talking about basic matters
According to verse 8, we should put on the breastplate of faith and love and also a helmet, the hope of salvation
Some who formerly were with us in the Lord's recovery put off the armor and thereby were exposed to the enemy's attack
The date of the Lord's coming is absolutely hidden as a mystery in the Father's heart, and this mystery has not been revealed
After covering the matter of watchfulness and soberness in 5:1-11, Paul turns in 5:12-24 to our cooperation with the divine operation
Paul's concluding word includes a number of crucial things, which Paul did not have the time to cover in detail
In the same principle, in verse 12 the word 'know' means to appreciate and respect those who labor among us and who take the lead among us
The word regard here means to lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion hence it is to think consider estimate esteem regard
It seems that the matters of watchfulness and soberness and respecting the leading ones have no logical connection
The weak here probably refers to the weak ones in general, who are weak either in their spirit, soul, or body, or weak in faith
Do not be bothered when others come to you with problems, even with problems that seem to be small and insignificant
In verse 15 Paul goes on to say See that no one renders to anyone evil for evil but always pursue what is good for one another and for all
If you try to practice these in the opposite order, you will find that Paul put them in the correct sequence according to experience
The believers who live a holy life in faith, love, and hope should abstain from evil in any form and of any kind
The inward burning of the Spirit is the operation of the Triune God within us, an operation with which we need to cooperate
In the second part of the verse concerning our spirit soul and body being preserved we are the ones who should somehow take the initiative
The word 'sanctified' here means to be set apart; it is to be separated unto God from things common or profane
God sanctifies us wholly, so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane
Paul's word concerning our spirit and soul and body strongly indicates that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body
The soul is our very self , a medium between our spirit and our body, possessing self-consciousness, that we may have our personality
The body is our external part, the outer organ, possessing world-consciousness, that we may contact the material world
In the spirit of the regenerated ones, God as the Spirit dwells; in the soul, our self; and in the body, the physical senses
For this God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element our soul from remaining natural and old and our body from the ruin of sin
Paul knew that, no matter how little was their experience in prayer, it still would be helpful for them to pray
The law makes demands on man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands
Holiness refers to the element itself, and sanctification refers to the process of being made holy, the process of being sanctified
To be in holiness is to be in the element, and to be in sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy
After a period of time and some action of stirring, the water will become tea-ified; that is, tea is added to the water and mingled with it
For the tea to be in the water is one thing, but for the water to pass through the process of tea-ification is another
We have seen that this Epistle has a basic structure containing three elements the work of faith the labor of love and the endurance of hope
The result of the proper fostering is that we walk worthily of God, who calls us into His own kingdom and glory
In order to have such a walk, we need to be perfected in our faith, and we need to increase and abound in our love
In 3:12 he goes on to say, 'And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you'
The establishing of our heart is the issue, the result, of the perfecting of our faith and of the increase and abounding of our love
We have turned to God from idols, we are serving the living God, and we are waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus
For this reason, Paul was concerned that the hearts of the new believers at Thessalonica would be set, built up, and established
We need to receive the mercy and grace from the Lord that we may give Him the permission to establish our heart
The Bible tells us that, as human beings, we have inward parts in addition to the outward members of our physical body
Why does Paul not say that the Lord would establish their conscience, or that He would establish their mind, will, or emotion?
Throughout the years we have emphasized the spirit, and we have stressed the importance of turning to our spirit
Now we would ask why in 3:13 Paul does not say that the Lord would establish our spirit or our soul, but our heart
In order to answer this question, let us consider some verses that indicate the close relationship of the heart to the spirit and the soul
Because the heart is our representative Solomon says in Proverbs 423 Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life
Using the illustration of electricity and a switch, we may say that the heart is the switch of our inner being, of our human life
As the flow of electricity depends on the switch, so our daily living is dependent on what our heart switches on and off
As he is reading the Bible and is disturbed by the dog's barking, something within this brother's heart motivates him to shout at the dog
Through fellowship with a saint, through coming to the meetings, or by some other gracious means, your heart may turn to the Lord once again
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
Otherwise, the switch of the heart will be turned off, and God will be cut off in a practical way from our daily living
According to Matthew 1234 and 35 both good and evil things may flow out of our heart For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
The good man out of the good treasure brings forth good things, and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things'
In verses 18 and 19 He goes on to say, 'But the things which go out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies'
For our heart to be holy means that it is separated unto Him, occupied by Him, possessed by Him, and saturated with Him
The water is separated unto the tea, it is possessed and occupied by the tea, and it is even saturated with the tea
If our heart is established by Him, we shall be those whose heart has been separated unto the Lord, occupied by Him, and saturated with Him
We may use the matter of giving medicine to children as an illustration of our need to bear responsibility to be preserved
He may resist the attempt of his parents to give it to him and even make it necessary for them to hold him down
In 1 Thessalonians, a book on a holy life for the church life, we are told that different parts of our being need to be preserved
With the mouth an atheist may say that there is no God, but in the depths of his being, in his spirit, he may sense that there is a God
Realizing the danger of blocked arteries, many watch their diet and are careful to exercise in order to cleanse their blood vessels
According to Romans 12:1, our body needs to be presented to God as a sacrifice, and our mind needs to be renewed
In Ephesians 3:17 Paul says, 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, having been rooted and grounded in love'
Mark 1230 says And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength
Many of us can testify that we have exercised our spirit, but still this did not always work to make us living
Perhaps the mind is not renewed, sanctified, transformed; it may not be saturated with the Lord and occupied by Him
If our heart is dormant or asleep, exercising our spirit to call on the name of the Lord will not be effective
Our mind must be the mind of Christ, our emotion must be saturated with the love of Christ, and our will must be one with His will
God created man as a pure vessel, but Satan injected sin into man with the intention of defiling him and spoiling him
After speaking concerning the sanctification of the heart, the inward being, Paul could not forget to speak concerning the outward being
As Paul was writing chapter three, he probably had the thought of going on to write concerning the believers' outward being
When he comes to the matter of outward sanctification, he deals with the most defiling sin, the sin of fornication
Because Gods will is to keep us always in sanctification we should abstain from everything that is unclean so that the body may be preserved
Once your mind has been defiled by looking at a certain picture, it will be very difficult for you to remove this defiling element
He dealt with the inward being represented by the heart and then with the outward being represented by the body
Inwardly, our heart must be established in holiness; outwardly, our body must be preserved in sanctification and honor
Chapter two tells us that the apostles did their best as nursing mothers and exhorting fathers to foster such a life
The physical body needs to be preserved not only in sanctification before God, but also in honor in the sight of man
We have the breastplate of faith and love to cover our breast, and the helmet of the hope of salvation to cover our head
In our study of the Song of Songs we pointed out that the breasts of the seeking one signify faith and love in Christ
Our head, our mind, the thinking organ with its thoughts, needs to be protected by the helmet of God's salvation
Eventually, in 5:23, Paul expressed his desire that the God of peace would sanctify us wholly, not only in heart or in body
Even though the soul is very much like the heart in its components, there is still a difference between the soul and the heart
It points to the fact that every part of our being-spirit, soul, and body-needs to be sanctified and preserved
In quantity God sanctifies us wholly; in quality God preserves us complete; that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect
For this God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element our soul from remaining natural and old and our body from the ruin of sin
There are some brothers who disturb the meeting by functioning too frequently without any real riches of Christ
If they stand up to release these riches, all the saints will be happy with them because their testimony will be helpful
Verses 16 through 19 say, 'Always rejoice; unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you
Of praising the Lord with the exercise of the spirit, they prefer to save their face by leaving their spirit in a deadened condition
My point is that we need to pull our spirit out of death and cooperate with the operation of the Triune God in sanctifying us
The church had two meeting halls then, one in western Shanghai and the other in northern Shanghai, quite far from each other
If you become contaminated by looking at certain kinds of pictures, your spirit will be defiled, contaminated, and deadened
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the way to preserve our spirit is first to exercise it to have fellowship with God
The way to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart is to make a thorough confession to the Lord
The artery of our mind can be compared to a ditch that is clogged with dirt and needs to be dug out so that water can flow through it
In order to unclog the artery of our mind, we need to confess everything that is sinful in our thoughts and in our way of thinking
As we are making confession in this way, we may confess to the Lord how natural our understanding is concerning many matters
You may understand your spouse, your children, and your family affairs in a natural way, not at all in a spiritual way
It may seem as if we are being examined under a divine microscope, for one by one there will be brought to light all the germs in our will
In particular, we shall realize that we are very rebellious, that we do not know what it means to be submissive to the Lord
Even after the doctor discovers our problem and prescribes the proper medication, we may not feel the medication is necessary
When we take the medication and it does its work to cleanse and heal our bodies, we shall be convinced that the doctor's advice was right
Even though we may not feel that we are wrong in our mind emotion and will we need to go to the Lord and take the medication He gives us
In Romans 8:10 Paul points out that although the spirit is life because of righteousness, 'the body is dead because of sin'
If we would preserve our body, we should live a life that never follows the old man, that never follows our soul
Paul illustrates the importance of preserving our body in this way by giving in chapter four the charge to abstain from fornication
Parents need to train their children, even those in elementary school, to keep away from these contaminating elements
The parents who follow this way in caring for their children surely will reap the harvest of what they have sown
We need to be careful not to look at anything, listen to anything, or touch anything that will defile our body
Pauls aim in writing 1 Thessalonians a book for new believers was that they would live such a sanctified and holy life for the church life
On the one hand, it is of human beings, in this case the Thessalonians; on the other hand, it is in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ
If we read this Epistle carefully, we shall see that a word of encouragement is followed by a word of correction
We have emphasized the fact that the basic structure of the genuine Christian life is constituted of faith, love, and hope
In the first Epistle faith and love are regarded as part of the structure of the believers' life for the church
How God deals in this age with different people is an indication, a token, a proof, of the future execution of His righteous judgment
The persecutions and afflictions are a plain indication of God's righteous judgment that we may be accounted worthy of the kingdom
If you were to ask certain Christians what the goal of their Christian life is, they would probably say that their goal is to go to heaven
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Because many Christians are veiled, they do not understand what Paul means when he says that God has called us into His kingdom and glory
We should live a life in the preliminary stage of the kingdom that will lead us into the full manifestation of the kingdom
In order to be accounted worthy of the kingdom, we need our faith to grow, our love to increase, and our endurance to be maintained
Paul admonished the saints to bear suffering because we need to suffer in order to enter into the kingdom of God
From that time onward, and especially since 1967, the Middle East has been the focal point of the world situation
Instead of being troubled by any kind of opposition, we need to stand with God, with the One who judges those who afflict His people
At the Lord's coming back they will be relieved of their sufferings and enter into the Lord's rest and enjoy its liberty
Although the universe is immeasurably vast in its dimensions, with the Lord there is no such thing as distance
It speaks of God's dealing out vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of Christ
God will deal out vengeance to two categories of people-to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel
Verse 9 continues, 'Who shall pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His strength'
At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory , and on the other hand, He will be glorified in His saints
As believers, we all may have the assurance that we have Christ in us and that this Christ is the Christ of glory
It is according to such a grace that the name of the Lord Jesus will be glorified in us and that we shall be glorified in Him
When we read these verses in chapter one of 2 Thessalonians, we see that they are truly a word of encouragement
Paul gives the Thessalonians a word of correction of the misconception concerning the day of the Lord's coming
At the end of the church age there will be a period of seven years, the last of the seventy weeks prophesied in Daniel 9
We have seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and finally, after a long interval, the last week, the last seven years
According to prophecy, this powerful person will restore the Roman Empire and will become the last Caesar of that empire
For this reason, the Jews will make an agreement with him, and in that agreement he will promise them freedom of worship
The Jews will be very pleased with this agreement, happy to have the freedom to worship the God of their fathers
The great tribulation will be the second half of the last week; it will last three and a half years, or forty-two months, or 1260 days
According to their understanding, the whole of the last week of Daniel's seventy weeks will be the period of the great tribulation
Those who teach that the coming of Christ will be after the tribulation use many verses from the Bible as a strong basis for their teaching
Those in this third school say that neither the pretribulation school nor the post-tribulation school is fully correct
The appearing of the Lord's parousia will be at the end of the last seven years, after Antichrist, the lawless one, has been revealed
In verse 1 Paul says, 'Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him'
Verse 3 tells us definitely that before this period of time Antichrist will be revealed to play the greatest role in the great tribulation
Paul did not want the believers at Thessalonica to be shaken in mind or alarmed with respect to the Lord's coming and our rapture
The phrase 'by spirit' refers to the pretending of a speaking spirit that claims to have the authority of divine revelation
The Greek word translated 'deceived' may also be rendered 'beguiled,' not only making a false impression, but actually leading astray
Those who see one aspect of the parousia teach the pretribulation coming, but those who see another aspect teach the post-tribulation coming
We consider the parousia as a whole and therefore do not stand with either the pretribulation or the post-tribulation school
One day, this temple will be rebuilt, and, according to the prophecy of Daniel, Antichrist will seat himself in it
Although Paul had been with the Thessalonians for only three weeks, he had spoken to them concerning these things
In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, 'And now you know that which restrains, that he might be revealed in his own time'
Although the mystery of lawlessness is already operating, this lawlessness is at the present time restrained, restricted
In verse 9 Paul says, 'The coming of whom is according to the operation of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of a lie'
The entire operation of Satan to deceive people is in its totality a lie, just as he is a liar and the father of it
In verse 11 Paul goes on to say, 'And because of this, God sends to them an operation of error that they might believe the lie'
In verse 12 Paul concludes, 'That all might be judged who have not believed the truth, but have had pleasure in unrighteousness'
The believers have the pleasure of goodness ; the perishing sinners who reject the truth of God have pleasure in unrighteousness
We all need to be clear regarding the Lord's coming and not be shaken or alarmed by strange teachings concerning it
Today some teach that Christians will not pass through the tribulation, but will be raptured before the tribulation
These are the schools of pretribulation, post-tribulation, and the school that considers the entire parousia in detail
We also saw that in 2:1-12 Paul gives a word of correction of the misconception concerning the day of the Lord's coming
At present, although the mystery of lawlessness is already working, there is a restraining factor, but one day this factor will be removed
The Lord Jesus will slay him by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the appearing of His coming
The bringing in of everlasting righteousness refers to the millennium to the thousandyear kingdom when there will be righteousness on earth
The 'people of the prince that shall come' is a reference to the people of Titus, a prince of the Roman Empire
The prophecy here in Daniel 9 regards the two as one: the first, Titus, is the prefigure; the second, Antichrist, is the fulfillment
The Antichrist, the one typified or prefigured by Titus, will according to verse 27 'confirm the covenant with many for one week'
In the midst of the last week, the last seven years, Antichrist will 'cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease'
He will stop the Jews from offering sacrifices on the altar in the temple and will begin to persecute every kind of religion
The time from this completion to the crucifixion of Christ was sixty-two weeks, or four hundred thirty-four years
In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus said that because of His crucifixion God would give up the children of Israel
The history of the church occupies the period of time between the end of the sixty-ninth week and the beginning of the seventieth week
He will force the Jews to stop offering the sacrifices, and he will seat himself in the temple of God, claiming that he is God
The Bible does not say much about the first half of the seventieth week; however, it has much to say about the second half
From the book of Revelation we also know that the last three and a half years will begin after the manchild is raptured
The one hundred forty-four thousand, first-fruit to God and the Lamb, in Revelation 14 will also be raptured to the throne of God
After the apostasy and the revealing of the man of lawlessness, there will be the appearing of the Lord's parousia
The Lord's parousia will begin with His coming from the heavens to the air and will be completed with its public appearing
In this message we come to 2:13-3:5, a portion of 2 Thessalonians that contains a further word of encouragement
He chose us unto His salvation, which is by sanctification of the Spirit, and He called us to the obtaining of the Lord's glory
By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory
Because the church life is a kitchen for God's cooking, the church will not always have an appearance that is neat and orderly
Wait for another period of time and you will see the results of the work that is taking place now in the kitchen'
Because our cooking has been improved, the local churches in the Lord's recovery today may be better than the churches in Paul's day
If you want the food in your local church to be flavorful, you must be willing for your kitchen to be messed up
God chose us from the beginning unto the faith of the truth and unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit
In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, 'To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ'
The words 'to which' refer to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, as mentioned in verse 13
The glory of the Lord is that He is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father's life and nature to express Him
In verse 14 Paul does not say that God has called us unto the obtaining of forgiveness, justification, or reconciliation
The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature to express the Father in His fullness
The glory of the Lord Jesus is that the Father has given Him the Father's life and nature for Him to express the Father
God has called us unto the obtaining of this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the divine Being
Although you may never have considered this before, this is the truth according to the revelation in the New Testament
In 215 Paul goes on to say So then brothers stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught whether by word or by our letter
Have you noticed that in Romans Paul speaks in one way, but in 1 Corinthians he talks about the same matter in another way?
If you see that a brother is weak or disappointed, you may say to him, 'Brother, have you not received eternal encouragement?
In 31 Paul says For the rest brothers pray concerning us that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified even as it is also with you
We all need to learn how to let the word of the Lord run and how to cause the word of the Lord to be glorified in us
The whole world lies in the evil one , but the divine life with which we have been born of God keeps and guards us from him
In verse 4 Paul goes on to say, 'We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that what we charge, you both are doing and will do'
In verse 5 Paul concludes, 'And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ'
The Lord directs our hearts by the leading of the Spirit, through whom the love of God has been poured out into our hearts
Now according to 3:5, we need the Lord to direct our hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ
As we read 1 and 2 Thessalonians, we need to keep in mind that the central thought of these Epistles is a holy life for the church life
In both 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians we see the basic structure of the Christian life a structure that includes faith love and hope
In 1 Thessalonians 3:2 Paul says that he sent Timothy to establish and encourage the Thessalonians for the sake of their faith
From 1 Thessalonians 3:10 we learn that Paul was eager to see them again in order to perfect what was lacking in their faith
In 1 Thessalonians 4:9 Paul goes on to tell the believers that they have been taught of God to love one another
In 1 Thessalonians Paul was concerned that the believers' faith would be perfected and that their love would increase and abound
Paul an excellent writer could not forget the basic structure of his Epistles to the Thessalonians with the elements of faith love and hope
In 1 Thessalonians 3 Paul speaks of holiness; in chapter four of sanctification; and in chapter five, of being sanctified
Paul's word about sanctification here implies all that he has said regarding holiness and sanctification in 1 Thessalonians
The reason may be that you lost your temper with your husband or wife, and this caused you to move backwards somewhat on the bridge
Suppose an old friend visits you and asks you to participate with him in a certain kind of worldly entertainment
If you accept his invitation, you will lose even more sanctification and move back farther on the bridge of salvation
Because he was involved in this battle, we should not blame him for failing to see other aspects of God's full salvation
The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written in an elementary way because they are letters to young saints, to new believers
Paul is saying that God has chosen us with a view to salvation; He has chosen us so that we may enter into salvation
In the foregoing message we pointed out that salvation here can be compared to a long bridge, to a bridge with a very long span
The bridge of God's salvation reaches from time to eternity; it brings us out of this present age into eternity
In order to understand these elementary writings to the Thessalonians, let us analyze some of the words and expressions used by Paul
Following that, God the Spirit came to apply what God had planned and what Christ, the Son of God, had accomplished
One day we were caught by the Spirit, and the Spirit began to apply what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished
Even though our friends, neighbors, schoolmates, and associates may not believe in Christ, we cannot help believing in Him
Because we have experienced the application of the Spirit, we do not have the freedom to do certain things that others are able to do
After speaking concerning profound matters in 2:13-3:5, Paul goes on to give a word concerning correction of the disorderly walk
Some believers thought that the Lord Jesus would be coming back soon, and therefore it was not necessary for them to work
If the young people do not have a proper education, it will be difficult for them to have a proper human living
If you want to do a certain thing and the brothers do not feel good about it, you should hesitate and reconsider
If we would have a proper church life, we need to learn to walk in an orderly way and to stay away from anyone who walks disorderly
Some who insist on following only the Lord may reply, 'We should study the four Gospels and see how the Lord Jesus walked
There were practical reasons for Paul to charge the Corinthian believers to follow him as he followed the Lord
Many believers today are confused concerning whom to follow and whom not to follow, whom to imitate and whom not to imitate
Because these traditions are free from the influence of the religious background, it is safe for anyone to follow them
In verse 12 Paul continues Now such we charge and entreat in the Lord Jesus Christ that working with quietness they may eat their own bread
It is only when the Lord is enjoyed by us as grace that we can keep the church life from any kind of misleading and disorderliness
Both to live a proper church life and to keep it in order, we need the enjoyment of the Lord as the supplying grace
Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians are concerned with such a holy life, a life that is separated unto God and sanctified wholly by God and for God
The two Epistles to the Thessalonians also emphasize the basic structure of the Christian life a structure composed of faith love and hope
