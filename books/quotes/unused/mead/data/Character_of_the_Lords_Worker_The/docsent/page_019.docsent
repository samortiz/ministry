   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is not a matter of how much we suffer, but to what extent we can endure suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suffering is not a necessity, but a mind to suffer is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord's intention is not to keep us in sufferings but to wrought such a mind into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No brother or sister learning to serve the Lord will be strong if he or she does not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not have a mind to suffer, we will be the weakest of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as we touch any difficulty, we will give way to self-pity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will weep for ourselves and sigh, "How did I become this way?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On a certain occasion a sister, who had been serving the Lord for years, came upon another sister shedding tears, and she asked her, "Who are you shedding your tears for?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people shed tears for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They consider themselves dear and precious, and they feel sorry for their own fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their tears are shed for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such ones are the weakest of all men; they collapse as soon as they encounter challenges.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The important question when trials and pains come is where our heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, there is the issue of our pain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, there is the issue of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not have a mind to suffer, we will immediately sacrifice the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will be too busy feeling sorry for ourselves and loving ourselves, and there will be no more energy to take care of the Lord's work!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is true that our suffering may go away if we abandon our work, but then the work will suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a mind to suffer is absent or lacking, Satan can force us to abandon and sacrifice our work at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must remember before the Lord that we are here to uphold God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God can order life or death for us, but on our part we have to be faithful to our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot forsake our work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must persist to the end. It is not our desire to see our brothers and sisters go through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If at all possible, it is good for them to take care of their daily needs in moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not asking them to go out of their way to look for sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not impose sufferings on others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our hope is that God would supply all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we must realize that a mind to suffer is very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, we must believe that God has not withheld one good thing from us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, we must have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not, we will collapse as soon as we encounter difficulty or setbacks in our lives.</S>
