<h2 class="head2">Ma-Tsan, Pu-Men, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. X dollars are for Brother and Sister X, and the rest is for the brothers who have boldly and selflessly advanced to the remote border regions according to the Lord's commission and who are suffering for the gospel's sake. They have given their lives and their blood for the Lord. What are our bits and pieces and our crumbs and chips worth in comparison to what they have given? Yet the Lord accepts a cheerful giver. Actually this is what we owe them (Rom. 15:27; James 5:4). This little amount is an expression of the Lord's love as members; nevertheless, we feel quite ashamed. Please forgive us for our lack. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Hankow and to all the gospel messengers everywhere!</p><p>Brothers and sisters meeting in Ma-Tsan,<br />Representative brothers: Fan Pei-jen, Fan Yun-shan,<br />Chen Kung-yuen, August 16</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-ch'un, Kirin Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Thank the Lord that I became clear about the matter of gifts. Now I am able to serve God and the brothers and sisters in the local church. The Lord has arranged a suitable job for me, which requires that I work only one hour a day. The rest of my time is free. I am able to support myself. Praise the Lord. I have not received the Local News and The Open Door from Shanghai for a long time, and I do not know what has happened to the brothers and sisters. I am quite concerned. The brothers and sisters are well here. Please do not worry.</p><p>Brother Jiang Shun-tien, August 15</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We are safe. Brother Hwa Tien-min returned to Manchuria. Brother Jiang found a job and is very free. He can serve the Lord as before. May the Lord cause those who love Him to experience Him as the fortress in the midst of all circumstances, amen. Peace to Brother Ho and all the brothers visiting the Lord's table in Shanghai!</p><p>Brother An Jing-tien</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-chou, Kansu Province</h2><p>I received the various issues of The Open Door from Hankow and received much benefit from it. Your translation of Mr. Paget Wilkes's book gave me light and guidance for my work in every paragraph. Both myself, as well as many Western brothers, are waiting for the book to come out. It will help us as well as those who are working for the Lord. I believe you have heard something from Brothers Lee Geng-shun and Sun Fu-ji concerning the situation in the northwest. During this period the Lord's work has become brighter and more vigorous. We arrived in Lan-chou on August 15. The prosperity here is unmatched in all four provinces of Sinkiang, Ningsia, Kansu, and Tsinghai. We intend to work in Jiu-Chuen. But this is a more difficult region than Tsinghai. Yet when we consider the work of Livingstone in India, the work of Morrison in Canton, or the work of X in Tibet, we feel ashamed of ourselves. Brother Lu Shao-gu, with whom we have fellowship in the Lord, was relocated by his work to Jiu-Chuen in June and returned to Lan-chou on August 14. He has sown some seeds of the gospel there. One can take a bus from Lan-chou to Jiu-Chuen (the cost is $44.40). We intend to conduct evangelistic work in Jia-Gu-Gwan, which is seventy miles from Jiu-Chuen. The brothers and sisters who have been praying for Jia-Gu-Gwan are joining us seriously in prayer and waiting for the Lord's will. We intend to first go west from Lan-chou to Wu-Wei and then decide on how we will work. We would like to draw the prayer-power from The Open Door, and we hope that some brothers and sisters will be sent by the Lord to join us there to serve Him.</p><p>Brother Liang Bin-yu and the co-workers from the northwest,<br />August 28, evening</p>
