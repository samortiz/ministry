<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:24; Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20b; 28:19; Gen. 1:2b; Matt. 12:28; Rom. 8:9a; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17, 18; Rom. 8:9b; Acts 16:7b; Phil. 1:19b; John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6; Rom. 8:2; Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; Exo. 30:22-31; Rev. 1:4c; 4:5b; 5:6; Zech. 3:9; 4:10; John 3:6b; 7:39; Rev. 22:17a</H1><P>In the previous message, we saw the contents of the Christian life. The contents of the Christian life are the Triune God who has been processed and consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit of life through Christ's death and resurrection. The Christian life actually is the composition of three all-inclusive things&#151;the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ, the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the all-inclusive resurrection of Christ.</P><P>The all-inclusive Spirit of Christ is compounded with Christ's death and resurrection. This is typified by the holy ointment in Exodus 30:22-31. The holy ointment is a compound. It is olive oil compounded with four spices. The first spice, myrrh, signifies the death of Christ. The second spice, cinnamon, signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death. Calamus, the third spice, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ. Cassia, the fourth spice, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection. Thus, in this type of the holy ointment there is one basic element compounded with another four elements. We cannot say that the four spices are compounded with the olive oil because the four spices are not basic elements. The basic element is the oil. Today with the compound Spirit, the basic element is the Spirit of God, which is signified by the olive oil. The one Spirit is compounded with the elements of Christ's death and resurrection.</P><P>We all have to learn these things, not merely as a biblical teaching but by our own experience. The most pitiful thing today among Christians is their poverty in life. A number of Christians may use the term life without really knowing what life is. Christ is life has become a slogan to them, but very few Christians really know what the Christian life is. We may say, "The Christian life is just Christ." This is absolutely right, but who is Christ? Perhaps we would say that Christ is Jesus, and Jesus is the Son of God in incarnation. This is right, but how could this Christ who is in the heavens be our life? Some may say that He can be our life through the Holy Spirit, but if you ask them who the Holy Spirit is, they will be forced to say that they do not know. I am sharing this to show us that very few know what the Christian life is. I trust that this series of messages will make us clear concerning what the Christian life is and bring us into the real experience of the Christian life.</P>
