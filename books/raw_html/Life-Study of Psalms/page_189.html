<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Psalmist,<br>under the Persecution of His Enemy,<br>Recalling His Enjoyment<br>with Others in the House of God</H2><P>While the psalmist was under the oppression and persecution of his enemy, he recalled his enjoyment of God with the throng in the house of God (Psa. 55:14). This may refer to the enjoyment of the festivals which the people of Israel used to have three times a year (Exo. 23:14-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE PSALMIST ASKING GOD<br>TO CAST DOWN HIS ENEMIES,<br>WHILE TRUSTING IN GOD AND ENJOYING<br>GOD IN HIS DELIVERANCE OF HIM<br>FROM DEATH AND STUMBLING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist<br>Asking God to Cast Down His Enemies</H2><P>"All day long they wrest my words;/All their thoughts are against me for evil./They gather themselves; they lurk; /They watch my steps,/As they have waited to take my life. /Will there be deliverance for them in spite of their iniquity? / In anger cast down the peoples, O God" (Psa. 56:5-7). On the one hand, the psalmist trusted in God; on the other hand, while trusting in God, he asked God to cast down his enemies. Many of us have done this very thing. While we are praying that the Lord will uphold us and sustain us, we may ask Him to deal with someone who is bothering us, perhaps our husband or wife, or our roommate. Have you not had this kind of prayer? Sometimes we may have such a sentiment within us but may not actually utter it to the Lord in our prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist Trusting in God<br>and Enjoying God in His Deliverance<br>of Him from Death and Stumbling</H2><P>The psalmist trusted in God and enjoyed God in His deliverance of him from death and stumbling (vv. 1-4, 8-13). In verse 8 the psalmist says, "You have counted my wanderings./Put my tears into Your bottle./Are they not in Your book?" This word of David regarding his tears and God's bottle may be a figure of speech in poetry as a comfort to himself under God's kind of care. There might be some readers of this verse who have applied David's word here to themselves and have been comforted by it.</P>
