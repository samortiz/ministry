We accept what the Bible says in full, from Genesis to Revelation, and we reject any thought of man that goes beyond what the Bible says
Although it is beyond our human comprehension, the Bible clearly shows that God is at the same time uniquely one yet distinctly three
The same mutual indwelling also exists between the Son and the Spirit as well as between the Spirit and the Father
We look to His imminent return, when He will come back with the kingdom of God and reign over the earth in the millennium
He is also called the Spirit of Jesus Christ, indicating that He is the source of the bountiful supply to the believers
Based on Christ's redemption, God regenerates the redeemed with His Spirit to consummate His salvation, that they may become His children
