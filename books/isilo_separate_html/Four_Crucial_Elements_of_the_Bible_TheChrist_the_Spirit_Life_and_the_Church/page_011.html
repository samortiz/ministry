These twelve verses may be divided into two sections. The first six verses tell us what Christ is. Romans 9:5 says that Christ is God, who is above all and blessed forever. First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is man, while 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that Christ is the Spirit. First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and Ephesians 3:8 says that Christ is One who is unsearchably rich. The latter six verses give us the way to experience and enjoy Christ. Galatians 2:20 says that Christ lives in us, and 4:19 says that Christ is being formed in us. In Philippians 1:20 Christ will be magnified, as always, in our body, and in verse 21a for us to live is Christ. Philippians 3:8 speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, and verse 10a refers to knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection. These are all very sweet experiences.<p>Among the human race, the Bible is a precious book that has its particular position. It has now been translated into many different languages. In human history, there have not been as many books written about any science, theory, or other topic as there have been about the Bible, a book that is truly comprehensive and exhaustive. For two thousand years there have been innumerable books discussing and interpreting the Bible. The Bible speaks not only of God but also of the origin and creation of the universe. It covers astronomy and geography, as well as the beginning and destination of man. In addition, it covers human culture, the conditions among the human race, and everything pertaining to human life. In it we can find science, philosophy, history, and prophecy. By this we can see that the Bible is truly a comprehensive book.<p>The most particular characteristic of the Bible is that it contains many indescribably sweet terms. In human society we cannot find another book that contains so many sweet terms, such as light, life, love, grace, righteousness, and sanctification. Unfortunately, many Bible readers study the Bible according to their own inclination. Those who are inclined toward science study science in the Bible. Those who are inclined toward geology try to learn geology from the Bible. Confucius&#8217;s disciples, who care for propriety and justice, discover ethics in the Bible. In their study of human history, those who love history must study the historical records in the Bible; otherwise, they cannot become experts in their field. Those who study theology surely must scrutinize the Bible thoroughly because it contains many theological doctrines. Throughout the generations many teachers of theology have studied the Bible devotedly and have written profusely. However, what did God intend when He gave us the Bible? Was it for us to study astronomy or geography? Was it to research science, philosophy, or theology? Did He intend to teach us history and ethics? Moreover, why did God give us so many sweet terms in the Bible?<p>I have been saved for sixty years, and in these sixty years there has not been one day that I did not read the Bible. I also have been writing expositions of biblical truths for over fifty years. After this year, I will have finished writing the notes on the entire New Testament. I can say that not only do I have a general view of the Bible, but I have also studied the Bible in a penetrating and thorough way. In these many years I have spoken a great deal on the crucial subjects in the Bible. I have been constantly considering what this comprehensive Bible talks about and what its essence or extract is. When I first went to Taiwan, I studied the Bible with the brothers and sisters every day. In one year we studied sixty topics, which are the sixty topics in The Fundamental Truths in the Bible. However, after studying that many topics, eventually I have to admit that the extracts of the Bible are nothing other than these four items: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. In the beginning is Christ, at the end is the church, and in the process are the Spirit and life. These four items-Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church-constitute the biblical science as well as biblical philosophy, astronomy, geography, ethics, history, and theology. Everything spoken of in the Bible is for these four items. Only Christ is the reality; He is the body of all things (Col. 2:17). If there is no Christ, there is no Spirit, and neither are there life and the church. If there is Christ, there is reality and substance. Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is life, and life produces the church. Without Christ, there is no Spirit; without the Spirit, there is no life; and without life, there is no way to produce the church. Hence, these four items are the extract, the cream, the essence, of the Bible.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
