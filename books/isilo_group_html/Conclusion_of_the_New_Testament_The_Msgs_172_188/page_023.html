But I say to you, Do not swear at all, neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King. Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than this is of the evil one.&#8221; The old law regarding swearing was that we should not perjure ourselves. The Lord&#8217;s new law regarding swearing is not to swear at all. The new law forbids the believers to swear in any manner, by the heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, or by their head, because the heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and their head are not under their control but under God&#8217;s control.<p>Our word needs to be simple and true. Instead of trying to convince others with many words, we should be brief and clear in our speaking. We should be able to say, &#8220;Yes, yes; No, no.&#8221; Whatever is more than a straight yes or no is of the evil one. Here we see the crucial matter that in our talking the evil one may be present. When we speak more words than are necessary, those words are not of us but of the evil one, the Devil. This indicates that in our talking the evil one is with us. The Lord&#8217;s word in verse 37 indicates strongly that the evil one seeks an opportunity to express himself through our excessive talking. Therefore, we should not say too much but simply say as much as is needed. If we go further than is necessary, talking with excessive words, the evil one will be expressed.<h2 class=head5>(e) Not Resisting an Evil One, but Turning to Him the Left Cheek Plus the Right, and Letting Him Have Their Cloak Plus Their Tunic, and Going Two Miles Instead of One Mile in Compelling, Surpassing Practicing an Eye for an Eye and a Tooth for a Tooth</h2><p>Matthew 5:38 and 39 say, &#8220;You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.&#8221; The old law was &#8220;an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&#8221; This is fair, just, and righteous, but it is too low. The new law, given by the Lord in verse 39, is not to resist one who is evil. Here the Lord says that when someone strikes our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also. To do this indicates that there is no resistance.<p>In verses 40 and 41 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;To him who would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak also. And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.&#8221; If someone claims your tunic, a shirt-like undergarment, give him your cloak also. This will prove that you have no resistance. To turn the other cheek to the striker, to let the one who sues have the cloak, and to go with the compeller the second mile prove that the believers have the power to suffer and to be meek instead of resisting and to walk not in the flesh, nor in the soul for their own interest but in the spirit for the kingdom.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in these verses actually deals with our temper. To resist by claiming an eye for an eye means that we are releasing our temper. If someone demands your shirt, your anger may be aroused. Thus, it is not a matter of a shirt but of your temper. It is the same in principle with being struck on the right cheek or compelled to walk a mile. Through the divine dispensing we, the believers in Christ, must be above our temper, not resisting an evil one.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 172-188) &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
