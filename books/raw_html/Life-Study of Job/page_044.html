<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Crying to the Earth Not to Cover His Blood<br>and Not to Frustrate His Crying Out</H2><P>Job cried to the earth not to cover his blood and not to frustrate his crying out (v. 18). Then he said, "Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven,/And He who vouches for me is in the heights./My friends deride me;/My eye pours out tears to God,/That He would adjudicate for a man in his case with God/And for a son of man in his case with his neighbor" (vv. 19-21). Here we see that Job would not release God, that he would not let God go. Instead, Job expressed his desire that God would adjudicate for him in his case. Job's contending here indicates that he expected to have a time to plead with God concerning his case.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Saying That His Spirit Was Broken,<br>That His Days Were Extinct,<br>and That the Graveyard Was Ready for Him</H2><P>Job said that his spirit was broken, that his days were extinct, and that the graveyard was ready for him (17:1). Job went on to say that his mockers were provoking him, even though he was upright, righteous, and held fast to his way more strongly (vv. 2-16). In verse 9 Job declared, "Yet the righteous man will hold fast to his way,/And he whose hands are clean will wax yet stronger." Here Job was saying that he was a righteous man who held fast to his way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BILDAD'S REBUKE AND WARNING</H2><P>In chapter eighteen we have Bildad's rebuke and warning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. His Rebuke</H2><P>In his rebuke of Job (vv. 1-4), Bildad asked him how long he would hunt for words. Then Bildad inquired of Job, "Why are we considered to be like beasts/And have become unclean in your eyes?" (v. 3). This indicates that Job thought that his friends were like beasts. Bildad continued by asking Job if the earth would be forsaken for his sake.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. His Warning with the Pitiful End of the Wicked</H2><P>The remainder of chapter eighteen consists of Bildad's warning with the pitiful end of the wicked. Bildad declared, "Indeed the light of the wicked goes out,/And the flame of his fire does not shine./The light is darkness in his tent,/And his lamp above him goes out" (vv. 5-6). Regarding the wicked, Bildad went on to say that terrors frighten him all around, that his strength is famished, that calamity is prepared at his side, that he is rooted out of his tent, that brimstone is scattered upon his habitation, that the memory of him perishes from the earth, that he is thrust out from the light to the darkness and is driven from the world, and that he has no posterity and no progeny among his people. Then Bildad concluded, "Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust,/And this is the place of him who does not know God" (v. 21). Bildad tried to give advice, but his words were words of waste. His logic and his warning were based on the principle of good and evil.</P>
