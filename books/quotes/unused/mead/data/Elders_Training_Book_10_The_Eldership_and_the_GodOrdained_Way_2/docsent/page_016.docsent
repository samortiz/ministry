   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIRECTION OF THE LORD'S MOVE TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's move today has a direction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The direction of the Lord's move today is:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 To build up the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and dispensing God in His divine Trinity for His full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The direction of the Lord's move today is, first, to build up His organic Body Eph 4:12 , a Body full of Himself and built up with Himself Col 3:11 as the life-giving Spirit, who is the essence, the element, and the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ Eph 4:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a Body becomes the organism of the processed Triune God John 15:1, 5, 8a , who is dispensing Himself in His divine Trinity 2 Cor 13:14 to saturate the Body of Christ organically that it might be His full expression in the universe Eph 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 To prepare the bride as the counterpart of the Bridegroom for the eternal marriage of the redeeming God with His redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The direction of the Lord's move today is, second, to prepare His bride, the church, as His the Bridegroom's counterpart John 3:29-30 for the eternal marriage Rev 19:7-8 , the universal marriage, of the redeeming God with His redeemed people Rev 22:17; 21:1-2, 9b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This universal marriage was typified by the union of the people of Israel with their redeeming God Isa 54:5; Hosea 2:19 and is clearly revealed in the New Testament Eph 5:25-27, 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3 To bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life for God's eternal administration in the fulfillment of His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The direction of the Lord's move today is, third, to bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into His believers in the church age Luke 17:21; Mark 4:3, 8, 26 and spreading in His increasing John 3:30 to be the enlarged, upcoming kingdom of God, which He will bring in at His coming back Luke 19:12, 15a; Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is signified by the stone Christ that became a great mountain the kingdom in the millennium , as revealed in Daniel 2:34-35.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This upcoming, enlarged kingdom of God will be God's universal government in the new heaven and new earth for God's eternal administration in the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in Christ as God's ultimately consummated household administration in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both God and Christ are aspiring to see the Body of Christ built up, to see the bride prepared, and to see the kingdom brought in, that Christ may have a Body, that Christ may have His bride, and that God may have a kingdom on this earth for His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no other way to accomplish this but the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is my burden, this is my desire, and this is what I am promoting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that you all will pick up this burden and this desire and endeavor to practice the God-ordained way.</S>
