In verse 26 we read, &#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image after our likeness.&#8221; How much is expressed in this short phrase. First, the plural pronoun used calls attention to the fact that God is a Triune Being. We must not think of the Trinity as mathematical; that would be tritheism-three Gods. The word &#8220;triune&#8221; signifies &#8220;three in one,&#8221; a threefoldness. We might use a tree to illustrate this tri-unity:<p class=indent1>A tree has solid matter, leaves, bark and wood fibre, all of which are visible. In addition there are in the building of the tree force and law; it is force that does the building; it is law that governs the building. Hence in its essential composition the tree is a unity; and these three factors and nothing else, two of which are invisible, enter into the constitution of the tree. (L. T. Townsend, D.D.)<p>Dr. Haldeman suggests the three light rays as an illustration of the Trinity as follows:<p class=indent1>Light is constituted of three rays. These rays are distinct from each other. They do not form three lights but three rays and one light...no one ray without the other two is light. If one ray is light it is because the other two are conjoined with it....The three rays are never confounded, neither is the one light divided, but remains one light. Each ray has its separate function. The first originates, the second formulates, illuminates or manifests; the third consummates. The first ray is neither seen nor felt. The third ray is not seen but is felt; the second ray is both seen and felt.<p>The scientific mind will perceive the analogy at once, but perhaps the best illustration for the average person is the relation between the thought in the mind, the thought expressed in word, and the thought received into the mind of the hearer. E.g., a thought is in my mind which I wish my friend to share. Unless the thought is expressed in spoken, written or printed word, it will remain in my mind unperceived by my friend. I express my thought in words and immediately the thought is conveyed in words to the mind of my friend. The thought in the mind of my friend, the thought expressed in words, and the thought in my mind are one; but a threefoldness is at once discernible. The thought in my mind is the thought in its completeness; the thought expressed in word is the same thought but not the thought in its entirety, for my words cannot fully express my thought; while the thought in the mind of my friend is the invisible counterpart of the expressed thought.<p>The expression &#8220;God the Father&#8221; denotes God in His completeness; &#8220;God the Son&#8221; is God visualized; while &#8220;God the Holy Spirit&#8221; is the invisible counterpart of the manifested God. This threefoldness is true of God in connection with all of His acts; therefore while we read in Genesis 1:1 that God created the universe, we also read in John 1:3 that all things were created by the Eternal Son, the Logos-the Word-God visualized; and we also read of the work of the Holy Spirit in reference to creation. (See Job 26:13; 33:4; Gen. 1:2.) We must guard against using phraseology that would indicate three distinct personalities in the Trinity. In our thinking we must not permit ourselves to disassociate God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, and we must remember that no being ever has seen God, or ever will see Him, except as He is manifested in Christ, the Eternal Son. (See John 1:18.) With this in mind let us now consider these words of Genesis 1:26.<h2 class=head1>MAN CREATED IN THE &#8220;IMAGE&#8221; OF GOD</h2><p>What is meant by &#8220;image&#8221; and &#8220;likeness&#8221;? As we study this expression we see that these two words are not synonymous; the former word refers more especially to the invisible part of man-the inner man-while the latter indicates the visible part, i.e., the outer man or body. The inner man was in some way created like God; we may reverently say, patterned after Him; yet how and to what extent we need to understand.<p>Let us carefully examine this subject, remembering that the failure to correctly interpret this passage is the root error of many systems of religious and philosophic thought.<p>God is a thinking, choosing, loving Being, and all of His activities are for the realization of a well-defined purpose which shall completely satisfy His heart; therefore in creating man in His image, we may clearly see that He created him a being capable of making a definite choice concerning a perceived goal which should completely satisfy the longing of his heart as well as the heart of God.<p>In other words, man was created a thinking, choosing, loving being; but we must remember that man&#8217;s thinking, choosing, loving is on the plane of created life, while God&#8217;s thinking, choosing, loving is on the plane of Uncreated Life far above. We must keep the two planes distinct, separate, if we would think clearly and logically.<p>We have said that all of God&#8217;s activities are for the realization of a well-defined purpose which shall completely satisfy His heart. Let us ask then, What was His purpose in creating human beings?<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
