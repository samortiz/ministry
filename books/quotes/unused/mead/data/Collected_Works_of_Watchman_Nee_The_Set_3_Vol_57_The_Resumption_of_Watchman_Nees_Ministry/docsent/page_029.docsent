   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Last Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Coordination in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Manifestation of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With each step that the Lord has taken in His recovery, the content of His recovery has become richer and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today it seems as if there is nothing more to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The recovery has reached the stage of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps this will be the last recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There may be other items of recovery, but as far as we know, when we reach the recovery of the coordination of the Body and the manifestation of authority, we have reached the final recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Taking the Way of Submission</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to arrive at this recovery, God requires that there be the manifestation of authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to take the way of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we submit, God will take the way of increase among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The need today is that such a recovery first be realized in us individually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to be an all-inclusive person, and we should have all-inclusive experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel we preach should be an all-inclusive gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a man receives this gospel, not only are his sins forgiven, but he is brought into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do this, in a few years' time the condition of the church will be entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today the responsibility rests entirely on us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having the Body Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we need today is a Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reality of the Body life lies in the Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is something that cannot be copied or imitated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Kuling one brother asked what his future holds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once this brother asked this question, his future was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Body we do not have an individual future; we only have the future of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would rather be wrong in the Body than be wrong in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would rather submit to the Body than seek for my personal future and offend the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LEADING IN THE BODY The Judgment of the Body Being More Reliable</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother David Hsu: How do I know that I will not lead others into mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Nee: Actually, we are not aware of all the mistakes we make in our own lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who is responsible for these mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, we are responsible for them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since we make mistakes in any case, I would rather make them in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is better to make mistakes in the Body than to make them in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If three, five, thirty, or fifty people know the will of God in the church today, and I do not have the right judgment concerning certain matters or persons, is it not better that I take their judgment than make a judgment myself?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Body we sometimes become more clear when we do not know something, and we become unclear when we know too much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a judgment is made by the Body, the responsibility rests on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes when things happen to us and we are directly involved with them, we become affected by the factors involved and fail to have a clear discernment concerning the matters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the Body is not affected by personal factors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not as easily influenced, and as such, its judgment is more reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not have any spiritual reality with us, these words may sound like Catholic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not have any spiritual reality, Catholicism will indeed come in. But if spiritual reality is with us, we will realize that no matter how good our personal judgments may be, they can never be compared to the judgments of those with spiritual discernment in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot fight against the Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we feel uncomfortable or uneasy, we have to give up and submit ourselves to the Body.</S>
