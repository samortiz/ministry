From the second half of chapter two to the end of the book of Revelation the Bible speaks about the other aspect of Gods work Gods building
At the beginning of the Scriptures we are told that 'the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished'
At the end of the Bible it says that there is a city coming down out of heaven, adorned with every precious stone
When we come to the end of Revelation, we see that the tree of life is no longer in a garden; rather, the garden has become a city
At the beginning everything exhibits the beauty of creation while at the end everything shows forth the glory of building
One picture is a natural, beautiful garden produced through creation while the other picture is a glorious city produced through building
The Scriptures reveal that God's work consists not only of the work of creation but even more of the work of building
We see that God's creation occupies only a little more than one chapter in the Bible while God's building occupies all the rest of Scripture
If God only needed the heavens, the earth, and man, then God would have accomplished His purpose after He had created all these items
God's creation did not accomplish His purpose; rather, the creation of God is altogether for the next step of God's work, which is building
It is only when God has done a further work of building on created man that He will be able to accomplish His purpose
God's creation did not directly accomplish God's purpose; the accomplishment of God's purpose depends on God's building
While fleeing from his brother, he came to a certain place in the wilderness and spent the night there, because the sun had set
He rose up early in the morning, took the stone that he had used as a pillow, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil upon it
In John 4 we see a thirsty Savior asking for water to drink and a thirsty sinner coming to draw water to drink
Even though he was not fully clear, under the authority of the Holy Spirit he spoke some very clear and intelligible words
We may laugh at Jacob's prayer, but we must realize that today there are too many Christians who are like Jacob
He said that if what he had asked for would happen, then the stone, which he had used as a pillow, would become God's temple, God's house
One who prays this way asks for God's blessing at the beginning but somewhat touches God's intention at the end
That day when Jacob asked God to give him food to eat and garments to put on, he was bringing up the matter of his food and clothing
It is strange that when he brought up the matter of a house, instead of speaking about his own house, he spoke about God's house
We have to know that in both the Old and New Testaments whether in Hebrew or Greek these three wordspalace house and homeare all related
When God revealed His intention for the first time in the Scriptures, He revealed it to a wandering, homeless person
From this point onward, the matter of God's desiring to build a house on earth becomes clearer and more concrete
After God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, He told them that He would dwell in their midst and be their God
When the children of Israel came to the wilderness, God charged them to set up a tabernacle for Him to dwell with them
They were wooden boards, yet they were covered with gold on the outside; they were golden boards, yet they were wood on the inside
We have to remember that God's dwelling in the tabernacle in the midst of the children of Israel was just a sign, a figure
God did not consider the tabernacle His dwelling place; rather, He considered the people of Israel His dwelling place
When the children of Israel raised up the tabernacle, the glory of God, which is God Himself, filled the tabernacle
After the children of Israel entered Canaan, God repeatedly blessed them, giving them rest all around and enabling them to live in peace
That day when David first wanted to build a house for God, even Nathan the prophet, who knew God, did not understand this principle
When the condition of the children of Israel before God was normal, God dwelt among them, and that temple was filled with the glory of God
When the children of Israel were in desolation before God God could no longer dwell in their midst and the glory of God also left the temple
Please remember, however, that God wants us not only to be His dwelling place but also to take Him as our dwelling place
God dwells in this abode, taking man as His dwelling place, and man dwells in it, taking God as his dwelling place
If your circumstances were to change a little, or if something were to happen to you, you would not know where to go
What this psalmist seemed to say was, 'Our forefathers throughout the generations all dwelt in You, and today we also dwell in You'
Jeremiah 50:7b says, 'They have sinned against Jehovah, / The habitation of righteousness, / Even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers'
The whole universe needs a building for God to dwell in man as His abode, and man to dwell in God as his abode
In this city, God is in man, taking man as His dwelling place, and man is in God, having God as his habitation
While the work of God's creation took only six days, after six thousand years the building work of God is still not finished
When these two are mingled and built together, they become a building in the universe, which may be called the universal house
Immediately after God appeared to him, Jacob said, 'This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven'
Bible scholars all know that in the Scriptures oil signifies the Holy Spirit and that a stone denotes a saved person
We can see that oil being poured upon a stone signifies that God is poured upon man, that God is mingled with man
In order for there to be the house of God, there must be the mingling of God and man, as typified by the pouring of oil upon the stone
On the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was poured upon those people, this also was a picture of oil being poured upon stones
When the cloud was taken up and the glory of God began to move, they knew that God was moving, so the twelve tribes would set out and follow
When the glory of God set down in a certain place, they knew that God had settled there, so they also settled there and stopped moving
Apparently they were desirous of dwelling in the temple of God, but in reality they longed to dwell in God as their dwelling place
In Psalm 91:1 the psalmist said, 'He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High / Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty'
In Psalm 921213 the psalmist said that the righteous man is like a tree planted in the house of Jehovah and flourishing in the courts of God
All those who understand the Scriptures know that the Old Testament is primarily concerned with the tabernacle and the temple
When the children of Israel were in desolation, God could not dwell among them any longer, and He had no choice but to return to the heavens
When their condition before God became abnormal, when they had a problem with God, God had no choice but to return to the heavens
The center of the entire record of the Old Testament is the temple, which signifies the mingling of God and man
When there is not the proper mingling of God and man, or when there is a problem with this mingling, then this building is destroyed
We must see that this is what God pays attention to and desires to obtain, and this is also what Satan hates and wants to destroy
When people were instigated by Satan to attack the children of Israel, their ultimate goal was to tear down the temple
Today's Christianity constantly pays attention to the story of Bethlehem, saying that a Savior was born there for us
The story of Bethlehem is not only about a Savior but also about the mingling of God and man, about God coming into man
The significance of what happened in Bethlehem is not merely that God came from the heavens to the earth but that God entered into man
The second stage was the temple rebuilt by Ezra and his companions after their return from the land of captivity
The third stage was the temple reconstructed by Herod when he became the king of the Jewish people shortly before the birth of the Lord
Since that day God's work has been to build the Body-the church as the temple of God-upon this rock as the foundation
He said that in Christ all of us who are saved are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
The church is neither solely human nor solely divine; rather, the church is the crystallization of the mingling of God and man
Both of these persons, one with a long face and the other with a frown, have God in them, and both of them have a prayer life before God
Although they do not make a resolution to refrain from having a long face or frowning again, both of them meet God and are touched by God
Now the condition between these two persons is neither hatred nor merely human love, but a love which is of God
At the very end of the New Testament all the building work of God is accomplished and a city appears which is the holy city New Jerusalem
The holy city, New Jerusalem, is a spiritual building as the issue of God being completely mingled with His redeemed people
In the building the saints are not joined to Him individually; rather, all the saints are united with Him corporately
Please remember that in order to be mingled and built with us, God takes this one way-He comes in the form of food to be eaten by us
According to the Scriptures, the first time God appeared to man was not as a God for man to worship but as a tree of life for man to eat
The Lord Jesus Himself also told people clearly that He is the bread of life and that he who eats Him shall live because of Him
These ins reveal that the Lord wants to come into us and wants us to enter into Him so that He and we may be mingled together and become one
It is altogether because we have continually been putting things into us, and these things have been mingled with us
After they were eaten and received into us, they were digested to become our blood, our cells, and all kinds of elements within us
If daily we draw near to God, enjoy God, and receive Him into us as food and drink, then He will mingle Himself with us
1 Peter 2 says that having been saved and having put away sins, we need to long for the spiritual milk so that we may grow
A child who is one year old is not an 'old child,' but after ten years he still looks like a one-year-old, then he is an 'old child'
When you met such a one twenty years ago, he was either blaming this brother for being wrong or criticizing that sister for being improper
Today, twenty years later, when you see him again, he still has no other topic except the mistakes and defects of others
Experience tells us that as long as you have a little growth in life, you can love the brothers and sisters and bear with them
If some brothers and sisters come to visit him, instead of feeling disgusted with them, he will feel that all of them are lovable
Worldly people form associations and join themselves together, but this is absolutely not what we mean by being built together
The more you grow in this life, the more you will love your brothers and sisters and be joined to them, even glued together with them
In order to grow in life and be built together we must pay attention to this one thing-growing up into Christ in all things
Concerning the building of the church, Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things
Our speech is unrestricted and has not been dealt with, and that we have not grown up into Christ, the Head, in the matter of speaking
In this matter, are we in the Lord in our words, in our attitude, in the tone of our voice, and in our intention and thoughts?
If in a certain matter we are not growing up into Christ, then in that matter we cannot be joined to the saints
In the illustration that we gave earlier, the brother who was in the accident with the car was a saved person and had God as his life
After he was hit by a car and was hurt, while he was in suffering and in pain, he opened his inner being a little to let God in
When he prayed and fellowshipped with the brothers, the element of God in him increased, and he grew a little more
Gods desire is that in all things we would learn to grow up into Christ the Head to submit under His authority and to be under His ruling
If we would be serious about learning the lessons in all these matters, then God would be able to do the building work in us daily
Not only so, the two pictures also show us that gold, pearl, and precious stones are related to the flow of the river of water of life
The constant flowing of the life of God issues in gold, pearl, and precious stones and in the building up of the eternal building of God
As a result, the element of God will be constituted into us, and we will be transformed within into gold, pearl, and precious stones
The more the element of God increases in us, the more we will grow and also the more there will be the building
When we are full-grown and fully built up, we will manifest the glory of God and become the expression of the New Jerusalem
If we read through the entire Bible, we will see that God's eternal purpose is of two aspects: to express Himself and to deal with His enemy
Generally, people find it very difficult to understand why there is the need for man in the universe and what is the meaning of human life
By gaining man as a vessel and putting Himself into man to be mingled with man, God can express Himself and deal with His enemy through man
At the end of the Bible when the work of God is complete, we also see that these two aspects of His purpose have been attained through man
If you read the Scriptures carefully, you will see that at the beginning there is a serpent, and until the end there is still a serpent
Revelation 12 shows us that due to the rapture of the overcomers Satan will be dealt with and cast down to the earth
In Revelation 20 Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss ; afterward he will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
After Adam was created, he was placed in front of the tree of life so that he could receive its fruit into him
The tree of life not only signifies God, but even more it signifies the God who desires to be mingled with man by being life to man
At that time in the garden of Eden Adam was standing in front of the tree of life and had not received the tree of life into him
At that time God Himself will be completely expressed through man, and also the enemy of God will be thoroughly dealt with
Sometimes you might not want to pray, yet inexplicably there is always an inner stirring that urges you to pray
He has no peace if he does not attend the meeting; he also has no peace if he attends the meeting but hurries to leave at its dismissal
Please remember that all these instances of having no peace are the stirring of God and the moving of the Holy Spirit within
We may say that the entire living of a Christian is the story of God's moving and constituting Himself into man
On the one hand, the presence of God will be missing, and on the other hand, the activity of demons will be rampant
On that day Peter and about one hundred and twenty brothers and sisters were mingled with God and one with God
We already said that God's building depends on our spiritual growth, and our spiritual growth comes from the increase of God in us
Since you have been saved for several years, you should ask yourself how much of God's element has increased in you
If there is no increase, you should know that you have not had much growth, and you have not experienced much building
Sometimes when you meet a believer, you have the feeling that he is so poor, light, superficial, and short of God
The more he talks about biblical doctrines, the more you feel that this person is destitute and as light as a feather
Since he has been constituted with God you sense that his thoughts are similar to Gods thoughts and his thinking is rich clear and bright
All those who have spiritual experience know that this is the spiritual reality and that God Himself is this reality
As we grow up eventually we will reach a certain stage and arrive at a fullgrown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
He understands God's desire, cares for God's inward feelings, obeys God's will, and walks according to God's word
After you have been with him for a longer time, his condition of being short of the measure of the stature of Christ will be revealed
When others are arguing, saying this and that, he says, 'Brothers and sisters, let us all go back to God and seek Him again'
Very often it is zeal or good intentions which do not issue from God's building that ruin God's work and damage the church the most
Being filled with God is based on Christs making His home in us and Christs making His home in us depends on our experiencing Gods building
The more Christ makes His home in you, the more you are filled with the elements of God unto all the fullness of God
In His building work God not only builds us together with Himself but also builds all of us together with each other
The Head of this universal man is God Himself, and the Body is composed of all the redeemed ones built up together
Not only is every member built together with the Head, but all the members are built together with each other also
Please remember that being joined together equals being in coordination, which is what we refer to as the building
The Scriptures also say that the church is the house being built up by God and that we are the stones used in this building
Just as a house is built with many stones, so the church as a spiritual building is also built with all of us as many living stones
From our experience as saved ones, we can realize that we can be independent if we are any kind of person other than a Christian
In such a meeting you may not feel that you have received anything, but in fact you still have received something
Whenever my hand is detached from my body, it cannot function because it has lost its supply, its protection, and its support
The elders should consider what it would be like if there were only a few elders and no other brothers and sisters in the church
From this you can see that it is not you who are able to manage, but it is the saints who support you in your management
Apparently our legs bear all the weight of our body, yet little do we realize that our whole body also bears our legs
No doubt, after standing for a prolonged period of time our legs will be tired, but when we rest, is it only our legs that are resting?
They seem to be in the water, but actually they are only floating on the water, without being one with the water
On the other hand, there are also brothers and sisters who are always joined, coordinated, and built together with other saints
They did not have spiritual fellowship with God, and even the more they did not know what it meant to be dealt with
We must remember, however, that merely to make someone beautiful through edification does not necessarily make him useful
Little sculptured monkeys and horses surely look beautiful and are admirable, but they are altogether useless for building a house
When you contacted them, you had the sense that they were isolated, exceptional, and that they had the flavor of being above everybody else
Regardless of how spiritual you may be, you still need to coordinate together with the brothers and sisters in your locality
In other words, there are stones above it, below it, and all around it-on the left, on the right, in front, and in back
Corinthians 14:12 says, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
Regrettably, today too few have seen that God wants to do this kind of work, and even fewer allow God to do this kind of work in them!
In many places you can see many Christian groups with a good number of Christians, some of whom are spiritual and zealous
We will no longer pursue merely to be individually spiritual; instead, we will seek to be coordinated and built together with all the saints
For the most part, all the wood that is to be used has to be cut, sawed, planed, and trimmed before it can be nailed and connected together
Everything natural in us, whether it is our ability, our discernment, or our zeal, is unsuitable to be used for the building
Your opinion your concept your capability your eloquence and even your love for the Lord and your material offering all need to be broken
One brother gives a message today to attack the other brother, and the next day the other brother gives a message to fight back
Now, due to the two brothers' ability to preach, the church has become desolate and the presence of the Lord has been lost
May the Lord make us willing to learn to be severely broken in everything, including our zeal, eloquence, ability, and material offering
Among the apostles' Epistles in the New Testament, there are two that are concerned particularly with the building of the church
With respect to Christ, the church is being built up to be His Body, because Christ has committed Himself to the Body
With respect to God, the church is being built up to be the dwelling place of God with God Himself dwelling in it
All the gifted persons who work for God need to see that the gifts given by God are all for the building up of the Body of Christ
Not only are God's children like this in general, even those who work for the Lord today have very little view of building
Their only concern is how they can help people to know the Lord, to pursue spirituality, to serve the Lord, and to live for the Lord
They never consider the question of the building of the church or God's desire to have a house among the saints
In any of the larger cities on earth you can see a number of Christian organizations and a great number of Christians
It is hard to see a group of Christians who are being built up in a locality as a spiritual house in which God can dwell'!
At a certain place the Holy Spirit even asked me, 'Can you see two saved persons here who are truly being built together'?
Later when the brother who was the guest had left, the host brother said to me, 'Brother Lee, you do not know this person
On the surface this one commends that one, and that one compliments this one, but you both feel entirely different within
Two or three of us have been praying together and meeting together here but why is it that there is not much of the Lords presence among us
Please remember that Gods presence Gods power Gods blessing Gods light and Gods grace are given to those who have been built together
Wherever there is a church that has been built together there will be Gods presence Gods power Gods light Gods rich blessing and Gods grace
Although they may not be able to present the truth well or preach the gospel clearly, they are all in one accord
Amazingly, places with this kind of situation usually have only a few people who have been newly saved and brought to the Lord
The preaching in such places may be very appealing, but very few come to listen to it, and even fewer receive it
There were those who were saved, those who loved the Lord, and those who were zealous, but there were not those who had been built together
When people come into the midst of such a group, they not only sense the presence of God but also feel the warmth that is there
It is difficult to find even one place where there is a group of God's children who are being built into the house of God
All the brothers and sisters who are co-workers need to seriously ask themselves what the goal and purpose of their work is
He knows that the house needs doors and windows, so he takes some materials, including wood and glass, and makes them into doors and windows
Naturally you will say that no builder would do this, but today many of those who work for the Lord are certainly like this
Although they are unseemly, they can still somewhat be put together and built into a house as a dwelling place
Since he works in this manner, surely a group of people will be edified by him and will follow him to learn to take the cross every day
The first message he gives is on fellowship, and the second message is still on fellowship; every message is on fellowship
After he has stayed there for a period of time, some brothers and sisters will be helped by him to live daily before the Lord
Those who have just learned the matter of fellowship will say, 'How can you be broken without learning the matter of fellowship'?
Perhaps you would say that it is not possible for those who have truly been broken to show disrespect toward others
In theory this is correct, but in actuality it is quite common for those who have been broken by the cross to not respect others
With them, every day is Christ, every moment is Christ, every matter is Christ, and everywhere is Christ, Christ, Christ!
The first group will then criticize them and say, 'You have to be dealt with by the cross before you can live out Christ'
You have edified many individual saints, but through your edifying work you have caused the entire church to collapse
We help you to know the cross and to know Christ, not for your individual spirituality but altogether for the building up of the church'
The apostle said that as a wise master builder he had laid a foundation, which is Jesus Christ, and that another would build upon it
In response to this, the apostle said that he and his fellow workers went out to work for the building up of the church
1 Corinthians was written not merely for the edification of individuals but even more for the building up of the church
In the Body of Christ you are members one of another, and all the gifts you have received are for the building up of the Body
We can see clearly that the apostle's emphasis in writing this Epistle was not on individual spirituality but on God's building
The apostle's work was altogether based on the blueprint laid out before him, that is, the dwelling place of God
What a pity it is, however, that today many use 1 Corinthians merely for their personal spirituality or for helping others to be spiritual
If you take a closer look, you can see that many who pay attention to individual spirituality eventually lose God's presence and blessing
Please remember that personal spirituality should not be for individuals; rather, it should be for the building of the church
We seem to be persons who receive the breaking of the cross the most, but actually we are the most difficult to be broken
In any group of Christians, the person who is most difficult to be broken is the one who pays the most attention to personal spirituality
Although he continually talks about the breaking of the cross, he is the hardest person to be broken by the cross
May the Lord be merciful to us and grant us to see that we do not need mere edification; instead, we need building
In Revelation 22:1 we see that street is still in singular number, showing again that there is only one street
At the very beginning of the Bible, the tree of life was mentioned with reference to man's relationship with God
In this universe God is not merely edifying individual people but building all the saved ones into Himself to be one entity
God has no intention to edify us in order to make us proper individuals; rather, God's intention is to build all of us into a house
God's desire is not to produce individual vessels by edification; rather, His desire is to produce a corporate vessel by building
If we read the Scriptures from the beginning to the end, we will see that this vision runs through the entire Bible
In the Old Testament we cannot see the tabernacle of God in any one individual, neither can we see the temple of God in any one home
Your work may look beautiful, and it may also appear spiritual, but you have to admit there is a serious problem with it
We should not think that as long as we are spiritual and as long as we pursue God individually, we will be all right
Regardless of where we are, we must not be single stones; rather, we must be built together with at least two or three brothers and sisters
When someone mentions another brother to him, although he does not say anything outwardly, he shakes his head inwardly
They care only about being clean and without a speck of dust before God; they do not care whether others live or die
You can see that there is building among them and that they can be attached to anyone, including the weak and the backsliding ones
Only when the two, God and man, are united will there be a universal home in which man has a place to dwell and God has a place of rest
If there is the presence of God, then any time is proper, regardless of whether it is in the morning, in the afternoon, or in the evening
If we know this principle and live in it, we will never contend with the brothers and sisters while we are serving God in the church
If we talked loudly, they would all fly away, but if we just sat there and talked gently, one by one the doves would come near us again
Perhaps your reasoning is right, and your suggestion is the best, but because we argue, the Holy Spirit as a dove flies away
If we touch the presence of God in all things, we will see that God will be there as the temple, and the building of God will be with us
If they are not unhappy with the responsible ones, then they are blaming the workers, or they are dissatisfied with the church
If we want to know whether a certain church is being built up, we need to see whether there is God's throne and God's dominion among them
While she speaks, her voice may sound very gentle, but the impression is the same: 'Come down from the throne'
We have to admit that this kind of communication and winning-over is not building; instead, it is man's organizing work
They did not greet people before the meeting, neither did they go to the door to shake hands with people after the meeting
In some places the brothers and sisters who rise up to serve the Lord do not know many doctrines but they are one and harmonious in the Lord
When you go to their meeting, you can sense the presence of the Lord, the authority of the Lord, and the moving of the water of life
When a brother rises up to speak a few words, you sense the watering of the living water which quenches your thirst
Due to the raising up of these two brothers the church is filled with death because these two brothers are in discord and against each other
Their messages are truly appealing, but the pitiful thing is that there is neither living water nor living food
All those who have consciousness in their spirit will tell you that neither the presence of God nor the blessing of God is there
That the city has no need of the sun or of the moon means that in this building there is no need of natural light
When you walk into a room like this, everything is clear: you can see chairs, people sitting down, the entrance, and the hallway
Very often when you are in the midst of a builded church, you also will sense that there is light and that it is bright there
If we have these conditions, this proves that we have been built up because only in the building can we have all these blessings of God
If the church has been built up by God, first of all it will have God's presence-God will be in our midst as the temple
God's life will flow among us to be our supply so that the thirsty ones may be satisfied and the hungry ones may be filled
If we have these conditions among us, this proves that we have been built up, that we have God's building among us
It also proves that we are in harmony and in oneness because anything that is built up will be harmonious and one
You will be able to touch the moving of the Holy Spirit as the living water, as well as receive the supply of the bread of life among them
The New Jerusalem has gates , and anyone who wants to enter the city and participate in the building of God has to pass through these gates
There are gates on all four sides: three on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west
The Triune God came to have a relationship with man and to be man's life through incarnation, death, and resurrection
In other words, it is through the Father's entering into the Son, the Son's entering into the Spirit, and the Spirit's entering into man
In the Scriptures the number four denotes the creatures; for example, Revelation 4:6 refers to the four living creatures
For the city to have twelve gates signifies that the entrance to this building is produced out of the mingling of God and man
The gates are pearls, the wall is built with precious stones, and the city proper with its street is pure gold
We recall that Genesis 2 says that a river went forth from Eden and that there were gold, bdellium , and onyx stone
In the spiritual sense, the pearl denotes how we were regenerated to become a new creation in the wound of Christ
By receiving the Lord's death we become a new creation through regeneration with the life that came out of Him
In the wound of the Lord we died with Him, resurrected together with Him, and also live together with Him in the new creation
When he rises to speak for the Lord, his speaking will bear spiritual weight and will be useful for the building up of the church
We have to see that it is truly a terrible thing for our natural being to touch the service of the church without first being dealt with
Their opinions have not been dealt with by the cross and have not passed through death and resurrection; they are all sand and not pearls
In the building up of the church everything must pass through the cross, must be in Christ, and must be the mingling of God and man
With many workers of God and many who take care of the church their ways schemes perception and wisdom are still altogether sandy and earthy
It has not only length and breadth but also height; furthermore, its length, its breadth, and its height are equal
If there are two ways existing at the same time in the church service, it will not be possible for the saints to be built together
Thank God, however, that in the New Jerusalem there will always be only one street of pure gold; there will never be two streets
There is a cross erected at the entrance of the church, and everyone who wants to come in must first be hanged upon it'
When the brothers serve together, the most difficult thing is that they have different dispositions and feelings
Some have a disposition that prefers things to be big while others have a disposition that prefers things to be small
Our view, our way, and our opinion cannot be separated from our feeling, and our feeling cannot be separated from our disposition
All these different human dispositions, human feelings, and human opinions become problems in the building of the church
Not only so, we should arrive at a state where the natural element is reduced to zero, while God's element becomes everything
When someone comes into our midst, no matter who he is, including even the most foolish person, he will be able to touch the way
In such a situation you have to worship God, because here there is the building of God and God has gained all the ground
During the discussion of certain matters, each one of them spontaneously expresses the feeling that they have before God
The amazing thing is that the more suggestions and proposals they have, the more you sense darkness and confusion
In the middle of the street of pure gold is a river of water of life, and on the two sides of the river grows the tree of life
The gates are a powerful filter, filtering out all that is of the natural being and leaving it outside the gates
Everything natural must be brought to the cross of Christ to be dealt with by passing through death and resurrection
After we have rejected all of our natural disposition and natural feeling, all that is left in this building is God's nature
All that remains will be that which is out from God and of God and that which is of the Spirit and of resurrection
They show us that anyone who wants to enter this city and participate in this building must be mingled with God
At the same time, this way of God's nature is filled with the supply of life, and it also leads to the throne of God
These conditions, which we see in the final building of God, should also be the conditions of the church as the building of God today
The seven items we saw in the previous two messages were all related to the gates of the city and the city proper
It also implies that the reason God created the first world and preserves the second world is that He wants to build the New Jerusalem
Revelation 21 clearly says that the wall of the city is jasper and that the light of the city is also like jasper stone
In the picture at the beginning of Revelation there is a throne with God sitting upon it as jasper and a rainbow around it
In addition, the city looks like jasper all around, and the foundations under the wall of jasper also appear like a rainbow
When you compare these two pictures, you see that in the former there is a throne, and in the latter there is also a throne
In the former there is a rainbow around the throne, and in the latter there is also a rainbow around the throne
In chapter four the appearance of jasper is smaller, whereas in chapter twenty-one the appearance of jasper has been enlarged
The area surrounding the city, calculated by multiplying twelve thousand by twelve thousand, is one hundred and forty-four million stadia
That the area surrounding the city is twelve thousand times twelve thousand means that the city is infinitely perfect
At the end of Revelation we see the manifestation of the New Jerusalem as the crystallized product of God's work throughout the ages
The light of this city is like jasper indicating that its shining is altogether the expression of the image of God
Conversely, if you go into the midst of the saints in a church which has not been built up by God, you cannot see the expression of God
If we want to be truly built up, we not only need to be broken by God, but we also need to allow God to do a constituting work in us
We need to be under God's constituting work for many years before we can become precious stones to shine forth God's light
Immediately after Simon Peter confessed that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said to him, 'You are Peter'
In the New Jerusalem the materials used by God for building are not merely ordinary stones but precious stones
One day the driver of our car said to me, 'If all the stones here could be changed into bread, we would be rich'
Sometimes when you meet a brother, you can sense that he is not only a stone but that he is also truly a precious stone
For the building up of the church every brother and sister must experience the work of pressure and the work of heat
Often brothers and sisters ask me, 'Brother Lee, we heard that you are going to such and such a place next week, is it true'?
You can tell how loose many people are by the loose situation of the spreading of rumors among the brothers and sisters
In the face of this you can only sigh and say, 'In the church few people are solid; few have been pressed, burned, and constituted
In other words, everything inside this wall is God's building, and everything outside this wall is not God's building
One time a brother said to me, 'Brother Lee, someone said that among us there is a wall, that we are always separated from others'
One cubit is about one and a half feet, so one hundred and forty-four cubits is about two hundred and twenty feet high
Not only so, frankly speaking, if you watch a movie, you will not be able to have proper prayer for at least a week
That dirty impression will be stamped into your mind continually, and it will always reappear whenever you pray
The situation of the foundation is altogether the same as that of the rainbow surrounding the throne in Revelation 4
Whether in our personal life or in the services of the church, the wall, the boundary, cannot be according to our discernment or view
Not only is this wall constituted with precious stones not only does it have a foundation and not only is it transparent but it is also full
May the Lord show us that this is His building and this is the work that He intends to carry out in the saints
In our midst will be God's presence as the temple, God's throne reigning, God's life flowing as the supply, and God's glory being expressed
May the Lord have mercy on us so that the churches everywhere may manifest all these conditions of being built up!
It was not until the book of Acts that the Lord clearly and specifically spoke concerning the way to practice the building of the church
It indicates that in His building of the church, the Lord intends to build all His believers together locality by locality
Every one of the Epistles written by the apostles to the churches was written to the church in a particular locality
Even the Epistle to the Ephesians, a book which seemingly speaks about the universal church, was written to the church in Ephesus
He wants each local church to be His house on a small scale in each locality and a miniature of the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem may be likened to a big hen, while the local churches in various places may be likened to small chickens
The nature, principle, and content of the New Jerusalem are also the nature, principle, and content of the local churches
Since the church is already in such a state of desolation and confusion, what should we do as as the children of God?
Although the church today is desolate and divided, the proper way ordained by God for the church is clearly set forth in the Word of God
A small number of people represented the entire people of God and returned to Jerusalem for the building of the temple of God
Although the majority of them are in confusion, we cannot neglect the intent of God's heart just because the situation is this way
In the midst of so many sects and denominations we need to discern the way ordained by God according to His heart's intention
It is only according to this way that we can be joined to the believers in our locality to be built together with them
Neither should we be individualistic, caring only for our own interests as a 'guerilla' believer or a 'transcendent' believer
What we need to do now is to get ourselves fixed in a locality so that we can be built together with the brothers and sisters there
If you have problems with the brothers in a certain locality, then no matter where you go, you will also have problems there
You hear that the church in Kaohsiung is quite good and that the brothers and sisters there are very warm and loving
When they were in Rome, they were in the church in Rome; when they went to Ephesus, they were in the church in Ephesus
The brothers in Kaohsiung must be built together in Kaohsiung, while the brothers in New York have to be built together in New York
His reason was that in the hall he was in there was a brother whom he could not stand, and there was also a sister whom he could not bear
He thought that whenever there was a problem in the church service, a transfer to another place would solve the problem
Since God has arranged for us to be in a certain place, we have to remain there in submission and learn to be broken there
You cannot be a choosing person or a jumping person, jumping from the east to the west or from the north to the south
Regrettably, however, almost every one of us has a common sickness; that is, we prefer other localities to our own locality
If you go and listen to Sister Liu, you will also hear her giving her husband a hard time, saying, 'Look at how good Brother Hwang is
If we have been broken and have been built up by God in a locality, we will be satisfied with God's arrangement
If we have truly been broken, we will have nothing to say wherever we may be, and we will be able to accept God's arrangement
Sometimes a grown-up person may have a sickness in a certain part of his body; if so, the function of that part cannot be manifested either
Every brother and every sister should pick up the burden to take care of several new ones and bear them all the time
Your real function does not come from the arrangement of others; rather, it comes out of your direct dealing with the Lord
If you pursue the Lord, receive His breaking, and are willing to be built up, your function will be manifested
We should not have the wrong concept that all the areas of service in the church are the responsibilities of the pastors and preachers
In the church we all need to exercise our function according to our measure for the building up of the Body of Christ
In the building of the church the gifted persons are meant to perfect the saints so that they will become useful ones
In the church we may be doing a very important work, but our work should never replace the service of the saints
The normal situation should be that the more we work, the greater will be the number of those who are perfected by us to serve
These ones may say, 'Since we have these co-workers and responsible ones to do everything, let us relax and enjoy
During the day we have already been so busy working in our offices, teaching in schools, and taking care of our homes
On the other hand, the brothers and sisters ought not to let the co-workers and the responsible brothers do everything
If we believe that only a few persons are able to serve and therefore always depend on them, then the church can never be built up
In the same way, in the church we must believe that the brothers and sisters have the Spirit of God and the life of God in them
We need to guide, perfect, and instruct them in all things, turning over our responsibilities to them so that they may rise up and serve
All ministries should be for the building up of the church locally, but the church should not be required to be for any ministry
He established the church in Corinth after he had been working there for a while, and a group of people were saved
It is true that in the church in Corinth there were four groups of people and that there were divisions among them
Honestly speaking, the problem is not with the brothers and sisters in general but with those who have a ministry
These people who have a ministry and who are especially gifted do a great deal of work after they are raised up by God
The Lord wanted John to build up those churches with his ministry, rather than asking those churches to be for his ministry
The enemy despised and mocked the children of Israel when they returned from their captivity to rebuild the holy city
The enemy tried a thousand schemes to frustrate and falsely incriminate them so that their hands might be weakened
He and his brothers carried out the rebuilding work with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon
In Ephesians, a book on the building of the church, the matter of spiritual warfare is also emphatically mentioned
At that time there were people from the outside saying, 'They are just children playing; after a few days they will be finished
What we were doing was not a small thing; it was not children playing but a testimony raised up by the Lord Himself
Sometimes for no reason at all, a brother would feel that the expression on another brother's face was not good
Sometimes we had problems within, causing us to be discouraged, to be weakened, and to become sick spiritually
When people say that what we are doing is of no significance, we have to bring this word before the Lord and tell Him about it
If the brothers and sisters are suspicious of each other, and if they are jealous of each other, we also have to bring this before the Lord
You will also see that a miniature of the New Jerusalem will be manifested to be a resting place for God and a home for all His children
They will say, 'This is the house of God, this is the gate of heaven, this is Bethel, and this is oil poured upon stone'
