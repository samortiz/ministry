<h2 class="head3">7. To the Fourth</h2><p>We may think that the ordinances in 23:12 and 13 are concerned with man&rsquo;s relationship with God instead of man&rsquo;s relationship with others. No doubt, the fourth commandment, concerning keeping the Sabbath, is related to God. But the details concerning this commandment in 23:12 and 13 are related to man. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.&rdquo; Here we see that keeping the Sabbath day not only involves our relationship with God, but involves our relationship with others. An Israelite was to observe the Sabbath so that the son of his handmaid and the strangers might rest and be refreshed. Hence, the keeping of the Sabbath is related to the Lord and to slaves and strangers as well. Furthermore, according to this verse, God even cares that the ox and the ass have rest. Again we see the sweetness of God&rsquo;s ordinances! God even takes care of donkeys and oxen! Therefore, keeping the Sabbath is related both to man and beast. God cares that man and beast may rest and be refreshed.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Supplements to the Law</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Concerning a Maidservant</h2><p>In chapters twenty-one through twenty-three we also have supplements to the law. In 21:7-11 there is a supplementary portion concerning maidservants.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Concerning Stealing a Man</h2><p>Exodus 21:16 says, &ldquo;He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.&rdquo; We have pointed out that this ordinance is inserted between two verses which speak respectively of smiting one&rsquo;s parents and cursing them. What is the reason for this insertion? In ancient times the purpose of kidnapping was selling into slavery. It may be that those who would steal people for the purpose of selling them were also those who did not honor their own parents. This means that someone who kidnaps a person is also one who does not honor his parents. Smiting parents, cursing parents, and stealing a person were all crimes worthy of death. The deeds differ, but the consequences are the same.</p><p>Those who smite their parents or curse them and those who kidnap people lack human affection. Why would someone smite his parents or curse them? Simply because he has no human affection for them. Likewise, a person who steals another is devoid of human affection. This is especially proved when we consider the fact that in ancient times it was mainly children who were kidnapped. Anyone who does such a thing is a person without human affection. This may be the reason that the ordinance concerning kidnapping is inserted between two ordinances related to honoring parents.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Concerning Damage Caused<br />to Cattle and by Cattle</h2><p>In 21:33-36 there are ordinances concerning damage caused to cattle and by cattle. For example, there is an ordinance related to an ox falling into an open pit and also about an ox that hurts another ox.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Concerning Strangers, Widows,<br />Orphans, and the Poor</h2><p>Exodus 22:21 says, &ldquo;Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&rdquo; In verses 22 through 24 there is an ordinance concerning widows and orphans. Verse 22 says, &ldquo;Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.&rdquo; According to 22:25-27, an Israelite was not to be a usurer with respect to the poor. Verse 25 says, &ldquo;If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.&rdquo; All these ordinances are filled with sweetness. The spirit of God&rsquo;s law is tender and touching, full of care for strangers, widows, orphans, and the poor. Exodus 23:9 says concerning strangers, &ldquo;Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&rdquo; If I had been a stranger among the children of Israel, I would have been deeply touched by such an ordinance. I may have wept out of the sense of sweetness and tenderness pervading God&rsquo;s law. A stranger may have said, &ldquo;Even though I am far from my native land and am a stranger among these people, there is even an ordinance which cares for me. How sweet!&rdquo; The ordinances concerning widows, orphans, and the poor are also deeply touching.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Concerning Helping the Enemy</h2><p>As we have pointed out, in 23:4 and 5 there are ordinances concerning helping one&rsquo;s enemy. This is an especially good example of the sweetness of God&rsquo;s law.</p>
