   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Furthermore, the Bible requires us to perfect the saints that they may do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This should not be done by just a few; it requires every part of the Body to perfect one another, and the best place to do this is in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the group meetings the saints can understand one another, and if there is any problem or need they can pray for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the mutual fellowship issues in mutual feeding and mutual help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, there is mutual discussing of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have found a very good way, that is, to take one of the books of the Bible as a line and pray-read two or three verses every day in sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, when we come to the group meetings, we have more than ten verses that we can bring out for mutual sharing and for discussing together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After we have done this for a period of time, we will be well-nourished in the truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We believe that God will recover this condition among us everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the lambs, and the perfecting of the saints, we have the final item, which is to prophesy for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To prophesy is to speak to men building up, encouragement, and consolation 1 Cor 14:3 ; it is not merely to predict.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every one of us who comes to the meeting should have something that he prepared beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should bring what we have received of the Lord in our daily life and offer it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You speak something, and I speak something; this will edify people and glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Up to the present time, these four things everyone preaching the gospel, feeding the lambs, perfecting the saints, and prophesying to build up the church have not been fully recovered among us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since these things are in the Bible, God will recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These things are rare in Christianity; but since we are here as the Lord's recovery, we need to rise up quickly and press on to endeavor and strive in these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not be content with our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not rich in content; especially in these four things we are weak and are not strong enough, and we are old and not fresh enough.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we need to be revived every morning and overcome every day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we must determine to endeavor to learn in the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we are willing to learn, nothing will be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>ENDEAVORING TO LEARN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My burden is here: Brothers, the Bible shows us that God has an economy in which He wants to have a corporate vessel, the church, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the situation that will be in the New Jerusalem should be the condition of the church on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, when we look at the situation in Catholicism and in Protestantism, and then look at our condition, we see that the entire situation is deficient and does not resemble what it should be, and falls behind what is written in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the Lord cannot gain us, He will go to gain others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sooner or later the Lord will gain a group of people through whom His holy Word can be fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His heart's desire must be fulfilled and His economy must be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, according to the entire world situation, it seems that the Lord is quickly doing this very thing; He is speeding up His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that all the saints in Southeast Asia can also see the light of this revelation and practice and learn with dedication.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not mean that you should immediately do this and do that; you just need to be willing to do these things and to learn, practicing them step by step in earnestness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You do not need to stir up everyone to do them together; that may not be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best way is to take the lead yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, two or three may take the lead to do these things, then gradually there may be five or six, then eight or nine, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way, spontaneously there will be an atmosphere in the church in which everyone is preaching the gospel, feeding the lambs, perfecting the saints, thereby directly participating in the building up, in knowing the truth, in growing in life, and prophesying in the meetings for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, the recovery of the God-ordained way will be widespread; every saint will be filled with the life of Christ and the Spirit of Christ, and everyone will be living, organic, and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the true revival of the church, and it is also the real situation of recovery that the Lord desires to have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Kuching, Malaysia on November 2, 1990</S>
