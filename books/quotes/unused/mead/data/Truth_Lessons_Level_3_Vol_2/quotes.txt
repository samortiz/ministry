[1]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON TWENTY-ONE THE OFFERINGS OUTLINE The basic offerings: The burnt offering.
[2]  The emphasis of the burnt offering is on Christ s being absolutely for God, even unto death.
[3]  In the burnt offering we see that Christ is the righteousness of God, and in the meal offering we see that Christ is righteous before God He is fine, perfect, complete, and righteous in every way.
[4]  This mingling also signifies that Christ s human nature has been mingled with God s divine nature; hence, He is a God-man.
[5]  The divine sequence of the five basic offerings opens with the burnt offering, showing that the primary thing for us is to be absolute for God.
[6]  The burnt offering is followed by the meal offering, which shows that we should take Christ as our life supply and live by Him daily.
[7]  The subordinate offerings are produced out of the basic offerings, such as the breast of the peace offering which becomes the wave offering and the thigh of the peace offering which becomes the heave offering.
[8]  God took the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering...from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings and gave them to Aaron the priest and to his sons for a perpetual statute to be observed by the children of Israel v. 34 . This signifies that God has allotted, in our enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering, the loving capacity and the strengthening power of Christ to us, the New Testament priests, as our eternal portion for our enjoyment in serving God.
[9]  The more we minister Christ as the peace offering and the more we offer Christ as the peace offering to God, the more we will have the loving capacity and the strengthening power of Christ.
[10]  This signifies that Christ, who is mingled with the Spirit without sin, anointed with the Spirit without sin, and saturated with the Spirit as the fine One, as the meal offering in our enjoyment of Him in His conduct, is our peace offering in our thanksgiving to God, having been crucified with the shedding of His blood on the cross Col 1:20 .
[11]  Like the offering for thanksgiving, the offering for a vow or a freewill offering is a kind of peace offering, and it is offered with the peace offering.
[12]  If the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he presents his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten v. 16 . This signifies that the maintaining power of the peace offering for a vow or a freewill offering is stronger than that of the offering for thanksgiving and that its enjoyment can last until the next day.
[13]  However, if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be reckoned to the one who presents it; it will be an abomination, and the person who eats of it shall bear his own iniquity v. 18 . This signifies that our enjoyment in oldness will not be pleasant to God and not right with Him.
[14]  By this, Christ is accepted by God and becomes our peace offering so that we may have peace with God and with man and enjoy Christ together as our peace with God and with man.
[15]  The subordinate offerings are the breast of the peace offering which becomes the wave offering for the priests, signifying the loving part of Christ in His resurrection for the serving ones enjoyment; the thigh of the peace offering which becomes the heave offering for the priests, signifying the strength of Christ in His ascension for the serving ones enjoyment as an eternal portion; the drink offering offered with the burnt offering, the peace offering, and the meal offering, signifying Christ pouring Himself out for God s pleasure and satisfaction; and the offering for thanksgiving, the offering for a vow, and the freewill offering.
[16]  LESSON TWENTY-TWO AARON AND HIS SONS OUTLINE Aaron typifying Christ chosen by God to be the believers High Priest according to the order of man: Being taken from among men.
[17]  Being able to be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses.
[18]  The sons of Aaron: Typifying the believers in Christ being priests to God with Christ: Becoming a priesthood.
[19]  We also saw how the different offerings are types of Christ in revealing the riches of Christ in His various aspects to meet the need of God and man.
[20]  THE SONS OF AARON A. Typifying the Believers in Christ
[21]  In the New Testament, 1 Peter 2:4-5 and 9 says, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ...
[22]  Furthermore, the New Testament believers in Christ need to lead the believers, who have received the compassions of God, to offer themselves to God as a living sacrifice 12:1-2 , and they also need to present the believers full-grown in Christ to God in all wisdom Col 1:28 .
[23]  The New Testament priests also need to be like fathers to exhort and console the saints 1 Thes 2:11 , teaching them all the counsel of God at the appropriate time Acts 20:20, 27, 31 , as the apostle Paul did in admonishing and teaching every man in all wisdom that he might present them full-grown in Christ to God Col 1:28 .
[24]  LESSON TWENTY-THREE THE HIGH PRIEST S EPHOD AND ROBE OUTLINE The ephod: Made primarily of gold thread woven together with fine linen.
[25]  The ephod and robe worn by Aaron, the high priest, typify Christ in His expression of God s glory and beauty in all that He did and in His care for the redeemed saints, the constituents of His glorious church.
[26]  In the ephod blue, purple, and scarlet strands were also woven into the fine linen.
[27]  Hence, in the ephod not only do we see Christ and His divine glory woven into His human beauty, but we also see His heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption.
[28]  Thus, the high priest bearing the two onyx stones fastened to the two shoulder pieces with the two settings of gold and the two gold chains typifies that Christ as God s High Priest has the strength to bear God s redeemed people before God.
[29]  Furthermore, the precious stones become a memorial in the sight of God v. 12 , that is, a memorial of the church set in Christ, a memorial of Christ holding the church, God s redeemed people.
[30]  Since the ephod denotes Christ with the church, the robe is for Christ with the church.
[31]  LESSON TWENTY-FOUR ANIMALS THAT ARE CLEAN FOR EATING OUTLINE Beasts that divide the hoof and chew the cud.
[32]  INSECTS THAT HAVE WINGS AND LEGS ABOVE THEIR FEET FOR LEAPING ON THE EARTH
[33]  HUMAN BIRTH, LEPROSY, AND DISCHARGES OUTLINE Human birth: Woman s relationship to human birth: Woman representing all mankind.
[34]  Leviticus 11 covers what is clean and unclean in the contact of God s elect with people.
[35]  This is confirmed by several cases in the Bible, such as Miriam s rebellion against Moses, who was God s deputy authority Num 12:1-10 ; the rebellion of Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, against Elisha s practices 2 Kings 5:20-27 ; and King Uzziah s rebellion against God s regulation concerning the priesthood 2 Chron 26:16-21 .
[36]  Furthermore, we need to offer Christ as a burnt offering and a sin offering to redeem us from our sin of not living for God and to be one with Him that we may become a burnt offering offered to God.
[37]  The preceding lesson covers different kinds of uncleanness, of which the worst is the leprosy in man.
[38]  This lesson covers the way for a leper, a leprous garment, and a leprous house to be cleansed before God.
[39]  In the matter of the cleansing of the leper, Christ is revealed not only as the two birds, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet strands but also as four kinds of offerings: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering vv.
[40]  From the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his hand the priest shall put some on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and some on the thumb of his right hand and some on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering v. 17 . This signifies that man can solve the problem of his trespasses only by listening to the word of God, doing the things of God, and taking the ways of God in the Spirit of resurrection, based on the redemption by the blood of the Lord Jesus as our trespass offering.
[41]  This signifies that the sinner who is to be cleansed, after being cleansed from the uncleanness of sin and sins through Christ as his sin offering and trespass offering, offers himself in Christ as the burnt offering to God and lives and walks absolutely for God by the life of Christ as the meal offering.
[42]  LESSON TWENTY-SEVEN THE EXPIATION OUTLINE The meaning of expiation.
[43]  The accomplishing of expiation: By slaughtering the male goat of the sin offering for the people: Goats signifying sinners.
[44]  The goat of the sin offering typifying Christ, who was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, being the sin offering for sinners.
[45]  Bringing the blood of the goat inside the veil and sprinkling it on and before the expiation cover: Sprinkling the blood of the goat on and before the expiation cover to fulfill God s requirement.
[46]  Signifying that the blood of Christ was brought into the Holy of Holies in the heavens to accomplish eternal redemption for sinners before God.
[47]  Concerning the Old Testament, the types in Genesis may be considered as a series, from Christ as light and life to the producing of a complete person redeemed, called, and transformed by the Triune God to become a prince of God; the types in Exodus and Leviticus may be considered as another series, from the keeping of the passover and the exodus from Egypt by the people of God to their enjoyment of rest and keeping of the holy festivals with God and for the full mutual enjoyment of the jubilee foreordained by God for His people.
[48]  This feast signifies the resurrected Christ for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection 1 Cor 15:20 .
[49]  This signifies that Christ was resurrected so that we might be justified before God and accepted by God Rom 4:25b .
[50]  In the Feast of Pentecost, two loaves of bread of fine flour baked with leaven as firstfruits were brought and presented to Jehovah as a new meal offering v. 16 . The fine flour typifies Christ at the stage of the firstfruits; two loaves of bread baked with leaven typify the church in two sections at the stage of Pentecost, the section of the church composed of the Jewish believers and the section composed of the Gentile believers; both sections had sins signified by leaven within them, being offered to God as the new meal offering for God s satisfaction.
[51]  The sixth feast is the Feast of Expiation, the Day of Expiation, closely following Israel s repentance unto God vv.
[52]  This signifies mourning, repentance, and sorrow for sin, and offering Christ as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man.
[53]  On the first day you shall take for yourselves the product of stately trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days v. 40 . This signifies the evergreen, nourishing, beautiful, and rich scenery of the humanity of Christ being lived out from God s redeemed people.
[54]  The seven festivals portray our Christian life from our salvation as sinners to our entrance into the millennial kingdom, which God has prepared as the peak of His consummation of the new creation in the old creation, so that God and man may gladly enjoy all the blessings that God s work of new creation accomplished in the age of the old creation.
[55]  THE YEAR OF JUBILEE A. The Jubilee Coming Out of
[56]  The fifty years that consummated in the jubilee comprised eight Sabbath years, being Sabbath upon Sabbath to be an eightfold Sabbath cf. v. 8 , signifying the superabundance of the fullness of God s rest with satisfaction to us.
[57]  For this reason, the Lord then said, If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed v. 36 . Furthermore, Paul declares, Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves; for he who has died is justified from sin Rom 6:6-7 . Then he says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death 8:2 . According to Galatians 5:1, God s jubilee frees us also from the bondage of the law.
[58]  When God created Adam, He gave man dominion over the whole earth Gen 1:26 to recover the earth usurped by Satan so that God s kingdom could come to this earth and God s will would be done on this earth Matt 6:10 .
[59]  The Feast of the Passover in the first month of the year, signifying that Christ as our redemption causes the judgment of God to pass over us and enables us to enjoy God as our feast, begins our enjoyment of God s salvation with God.
[60]  In the first three books of the Old Testament Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus different types are used to portray Christ and the church, Christ s redemption and God s salvation, man s condition and his need, and the believers proper living and service before God.
[61]  Even though God had gone before them in the fire by night and in the cloud by day, seeking out places for them to camp and showing them the way they should go v. 33 , the children of Israel disregarded God s care for them in the wilderness because of the evil report brought back by ten of the twelve men who went to spy out the good land and because they forgot how He had carried them through the great and awesome wilderness v. 31 . Thus, they had an evil heart of unbelief, believing neither in God nor in His promise.
[62]  At Pentecost, the church entered into the good land promised by God in Christ, but because of unbelief, the church later failed to enter into the blessing promised by God in Christ to enjoy His riches.
[63]  KINGS, PROPHETS, AND SHEPHERDS OUTLINE Priests: The priestly ministry: Drawing near to God and waiting in His presence.
[64]  There are five kinds of people with special statuses in the Old Testament priests, Nazarites, kings, prophets, and shepherds.
[65]  Christ, as the offerings presented to God, solves man s problem of sin and man s other problems before God.
[66]  When we experience Christ as the life supply within us, we will be able to spread the Christ whom we have experienced before God as the life supply to God and man.
[67]  When we pray by such a Christ to contact God, turning Christ and the effectiveness of His death and resurrection into prayer, we are accepted by God so that we are brought into His sweet presence to fellowship with Him.
[68]  God s original intention was that all His people would fulfill the priestly ministry.
[69]  Every regenerated believer should grow by being nourished with Christ v. 2 and be built together into a priesthood to serve God corporately, offering up Christ as a spiritual sacrifice for God s satisfaction.
[70]  Although not every Israelite was blessed with being chosen by God, everyone could voluntarily consecrate himself to be a Nazarite and receive the blessing of God s choosing.
[71]  David and the Lord Jesus knew God s authority from their heart and always submitted themselves under God s authority so that eventually they could reign for God.
[72]  Many times when prophets speak for God and speak forth God, they also prophesy, predict, for God.
[73]  In the Old Testament, especially in the books of the major and minor prophets, many of the speakings of the prophets were in the nature of predictions, conveying beforehand things which God would do or things which would happen, so that they might lead God s people to walk in God s will.
[74]  In the Old Testament, in addition to the ministries of the priests, kings, and prophets, there was another ministry related to God s people, the ministry of the shepherds Jer 23:3-4; Ezek.
[75]  LESSON THIRTY-ONE THE FRINGES, THE WATER FOR IMPURITY,
[76]  AND THE CITIES OF REFUGE OUTLINE The fringes: The fringes indicating beauty.
[77]  There are three things in the book of Numbers which are rich in spiritual meaning, functioning as types and symbols.
[78]  Now we shall see the usage of the water for impurity.
[79]  Only the working of Christ s redemption, through His dignified and humbled humanity and with His death and the Spirit of His resurrection, could heal and cleanse the situation of God s people, a situation full of death.
[80]  The cities of refuge were six in number v. 13 . The number six signifies mistake-making man, who was created by God on the sixth day Gen 1:26-27, 31 . Hence, God commanded that cities of refuge be set up that the refuge of God might be brought to sinful man.
[81]  The cities of refuge were provided so that a manslayer who killed any person unintentionally may flee there v. 11b . Verse 12 says, The cities shall be for you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer may not die unless he stands before the assembly for judgment.
[82]  Five seemingly unrelated items the bronze serpent, the one hanging on a tree, the hind of the dawn, and the bridegroom and the bride are considered together in this lesson.
[83]  The first two items signify the crucified Christ, the third item signifies the resurrected Christ, and the last two items signify Christ in His resurrection as the Bridegroom gaining the church as His bride.
[84]  When the people repented and confessed their sins, God commanded Moses to make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, lifting it up, to suffer God s judgment as a replacement for the people and to redeem them from their sins.
[85]  This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man and made man not only a sinner but also sin itself under God s judgment; hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh Rom 5:12; John 1:14 , He was made sin not sinful on our behalf to be judged by God Rom 8:3 .
[86]  THE ONE HANGING ON A TREE A. Being One Who Sinned
[87]  In reiterating the statutes of the law of God in Deuteronomy 21:22, Moses said, If in a man there is a sin, a cause worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree.
[88]  THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE A. Typifying Christ and the Church
[89]  The Bible reveals that God in Christ is the Bridegroom of His elect as His bride.
[90]  OF THE JORDAN RIVER OUTLINE The Jordan River typifying the death and resurrection of Christ: Being the death of Christ into which the believers have been baptized.
[91]  LESSON THIRTY-FOUR RUTH AND BOAZ OUTLINE Ruth: Being one of the Moabites, who were forbidden to enter the holy congregation of Jehovah.
[92]  Becoming a part of Israel and partaking of her husband s inheritance through marriage.
[93]  Both Ruth s husband and his brother died without leaving any descendants, and her husband had no other brother who could marry her to bear children for her husband.
[94]  Nevertheless, she followed her widowed mother-in-law to the land of Judah to be a citizen of Israel and to receive the God of Israel as her God.
[95]  For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God v. 16 . Ruth chose the goal of God and His kingdom in order to participate with God s elect in the enjoyment of Christ.
[96]  Regardless of who we are and what our background is, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ as long as we have a heart that seeks God and His people.
[97]  Ruth s becoming a new wife to Boaz after being redeemed by him typifies the church s becoming the counterpart of Christ after being saved through the regeneration of her natural man v. 4b . Our natural man was created by God to be God s counterpart, taking God as our Husband and Head, but in the fall our natural man put God aside and made himself the husband and head, thus becoming the main part of our old man.
[98]  Ruth 2:1 says, Naomi had a relative of her husband s, a man of great wealth, from Elimelech s family; and his name was Boaz.
[99]  Thus, she became an important ancestor in the genealogy of Christ to continue the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ to accomplish the eternal economy of God.
[100]  She typifies the Gentile church, before her salvation, as men in God s creation and sinners in man s fall, yet the church with her old man as her crucified husband was redeemed by Christ for the recovery of the lost right of her natural man in God s creation.
[101]  FROM THE TABERNACLE OUTLINE The Ark separated from the tabernacle: Typifying Christ leaving the formal church.
[102]  I. THE ARK SEPARATED FROM THE TABERNACLE A. Typifying Christ Leaving the Formal Church
[103]  The Ark being separated from the tabernacle was a very abnormal situation.
[104]  The Ark is a type of Christ as the center of God s testimony.
[105]  Furthermore, he prayed, Arise, O Jehovah, unto Your resting place, / You and the Ark of Your strength v. 8 . His heart s desire was acceptable to God, and God sent the prophet Nathan to tell David that God would give him a son, Solomon, who would be a man of peace and would build the temple for God.
[106]  In the New Testament age, following the desolation and decline of the church, Christ left the formal church to be individually with the believers who love Him with a pure heart and who also have a desire to let Christ make His home in them.
[107]  God s intention, His eternal purpose, is that the believers would be built up to be the universal house of the processed and consummated Triune God, which is the holy temple in the Lord Eph 2:21 , and to be the organic Body of Christ as a great corporate vessel for His expression to consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God in eternity forever and ever.
[108]  LESSON THIRTY-SIX THE TEMPLE OUTLINE The temple being the consummation of the tabernacle.
[109]  The building of the temple being David s desire: David typifying the suffering Christ, who fought for the kingdom of God.
[110]  God desiring that Solomon would build the temple for Him: Solomon typifying the resurrected Christ, who is for the building of the dwelling place of God in the peace of His resurrection.
[111]  The temple typifying the individual Christ as the dwelling place of God: Christ becoming flesh to be the tabernacle of God and the temple of God.
[112]  Whereas Solomon and the temple he built played the strongest roles and occupied a wide span in the history of Israel, Christ and the church as the unique building of God in the universe are the centrality, universality, and goal of God s eternal economy.
[113]  They both signify the incarnated Christ as God s dwelling place on the earth and the church John 2:19-21; 1:14; Matt 12:6 , including all the believers, the members of Christ, to be the enlargement of Christ as God s dwelling place on the earth 1 Cor 3:16; 6:19; Eph 2:21-22 .
[114]  In His resurrection Christ regenerated the believers, who were raised up together with Him 1 Pet 1:3 , that they may have God s life and nature and become God s new creation 2 Cor 5:17 , which comes out of the old creation by its passing through death and resurrection.
[115]  A GREEN FIR TREE OUTLINE The Shoot of Jehovah: Typifying the sprouting of the divinity of Christ in Him: Coming out of God as the branching out of God Himself.
[116]  The Holy Scriptures, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, use various plants, trees, and flowers to signify God, Christ, the church, the saints, and the world.
[117]  This lesson covers eight items: the Shoot of Jehovah, the Shoot of David, a twig coming forth from the stem of Jesse, a branch from Jesse s roots, the root of Jesse, a tender plant growing up before Jehovah and a root out of dry ground, the fruit, and a green fir tree.
[118]  The Shoot of Jehovah typifies not only Christ s divinity but the sprouting and development of Christ s divinity through the incarnation of God.
[119]  The sprouting and development of God in Christ are for the expression of all the riches of divinity in Christ s humanity, that is, for the rich attributes of divinity to be developed into the virtues of Christ, the God-man, in His humanity.
[120]  THE SHOOT OF DAVID A. Typifying the Development and
[121]  The development of His humanity is from His birth as the Son of Man to the uplifting of His humanity into His divinity in resurrection, that is, the mingling of His humanity with His divinity for Him to be the firstborn Son of God with two natures divinity and humanity Rom 8:29 .
[122]  This implies that although He was born of a poor family as a poor and humble person, eventually He became the Christ of God, the Messiah, to be the King of God s elect for eternity.
[123]  Rev 22:16 , and the arm of Jehovah Isa 53:1 , and concerning Christ in His humanity, such as a sprout coming forth from the stump of Jesse, a branch from the roots of Jesse 11:1 , a child 9:6 , a tender plant, a root out of dry ground 53:2 , a lamb, a sheep v. 7 , and an offering for sin v. 10 . The sprout that came forth from the stump of Jesse linked Christ in His humanity not only to Jesse and David but also to the entire royal tribe of Judah, as seen in the blessing with which Jacob and Moses blessed Israel Gen 49:9-10; Deut 33:7 .
[124]  Christ s growing up before Jehovah was a matter before God.
[125]  LESSON THIRTY-EIGHT THE TWO OLIVE TREES OUTLINE Moses and Elijah being representatives of the law and the prophets in the Old Testament.
[126]  Moses and Elijah appearing before the Lord Jesus in His transfiguration on the mount.
[127]  Zechariah 4:2 likens God s people, the Israelites, to the golden lampstand which testifies for God.
[128]  Therefore, Moses and Elijah are the two sons of oil standing before God to supply God s people with the Spirit in God s word as the olive oil that they may receive the rich Spirit to be God s lampstand shining and testifying for God.
[129]  Moses and Elijah minister not only to God s Old Testament people but also to God s New Testament believers.
[130]  The Bible uses not only plants to signify God, Christ, the church, the believers, and the world but also stones to signify Christ and the believers.
[131]  Using stones as symbols, the Bible likens Christ to a living stone, rejected by men but with God precious for the accomplishing of the glorious building in God s eternal economy 1 Pet 2:4 .
[132]  As the divine, massive rock as the foundation of God s divine building, Christ has sufficient strength to uphold the entire building of God in the universe, that is, His universal church.
[133]  As the living stone and the rock, Christ is not only the foundation stone to uphold God s building but also the cornerstone Isa 28:16; Eph 2:20b; Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:6-7 to join the different sides, the different sections, of God s building.
[134]  This is to join the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, to the unique church, which is the holy temple of God in the universe Eph 2:18-21 , so that the Jewish and Gentile believers may become one Body 2:16; 3:6 as the fullness of God v. 19 to be the great universal, corporate expression of God.
[135]  As the rock laid by God, Christ is not only a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling to the unbelieving perverted ones but also a smiting stone to those who rebel against God and oppose God Dan 2:34-35, 44-45; Matt 21:44b .
[136]  Before He becomes the stone to smite God s enemy for the kingdom, He first became the seed of God s kingdom to grow God s kingdom Mark 4:3, 26 .
[137]  LESSON FORTY THE SUN, THE MOON, AND THE STARS OUTLINE The sun, the moon, and the stars signifying the totality of God s redeemed: The sun, the moon, and the stars signifying the whole house of Jacob.
[138]  The sun, the moon, and the stars signifying the totality of the saints in the Old and New Testaments: The New Testament believers as the sun.
[139]  In this last lesson on the types of the Old Testament, we will cover how Christ, the overcomers as His followers, and the totality of God s redeemed people are typified in the Bible by the heavenly luminaries, the three lights created by God the sun, the moon, and the stars Gen 1:14-18 .
[140]  The Bible uses the heavenly luminaries, the three lights, in God s creation as signs to portray God s redeemed, because even though man sees his trespasses, iniquities, defilement, and uncleanness, God sees His people as clean and bright.
[141]  Jacob and his whole house were chosen and redeemed by God, but God chose and redeemed them not according to what they were and did in their natural life but according to the will of God s supreme sovereignty and His abundant mercy Rom 9:10-18 .
[142]  In both the Old and New Testaments the sun is used mainly to signify the Christ of glory.
[143]  Since God s redeemed people have received His perfect redemption, they belong to Christ and are of the same kind as Christ.
[144]  In the eyes of God, Christ is the shining star and the redeemed of God are bright stars.
[145]  According to Daniel 12:3, God s redeemed in the Old Testament, that is, those who turn many to righteousness, who lead people to God, and who do righteousness by God, will shine as stars forever and ever.
[146]  If the redeemed people of God in the Old Testament can shine as stars, the believers who have received God s grace in the New Testament should shine much more as the heavenly stars in today s dark age.
[147]  At His second coming to the earth, to those who fear the Lord s name, Christ will appear as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings, and His shining will be full of the restoring power to eliminate death and decay in God s creation.
