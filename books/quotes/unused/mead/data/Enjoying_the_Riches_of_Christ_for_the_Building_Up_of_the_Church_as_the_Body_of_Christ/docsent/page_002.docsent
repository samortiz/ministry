   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eternal purpose of God mentioned in Ephesians 3:11 is the purpose God made in and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This purpose is something of God's good pleasure and will 1:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three things are related: purpose, good pleasure, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 1:9 speaks of "the mystery of His will."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's will is a mystery because from the beginning of the world God did not reveal His pleasure to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was something hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although today we have the Bible, many people still do not know the purpose of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why was the universe created with the heavens, the earth, and billions of creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why was man created?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the purpose of man's creation?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These questions have puzzled many great men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout time, many strong, clever, and thoughtful men have been puzzled by such questions and have tried in vain to discover the purpose of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may say that the purpose of creation with all the beauty of nature is to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apparently, this answer is good, but it is merely something that we have inherited from the Christian religion; it comes short of revealing what God's purpose is according to the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD'S PURPOSE BEING TO HAVE THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's purpose is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 1 reveals that God created the heavens and the earth with billions of items.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's intention in creating billions of items with man as the center is to have the church.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is according to God's plan, God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 3:10-11 says, "In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eternal purpose can be translated "eternal plan."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God planned in eternity and for eternity to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God planned to have the church because this is His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may compare this to eating dessert; we eat dessert because it is our pleasure to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The good pleasure of God's will is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians talk about the will of God, yet few know what the will of God is.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our marriage and education are a part of the church, then they are something in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they are not a part of the church, although we may consider them to be in God's will, in reality they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To repeat, God has only one will, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has a plan, and this plan was made according to the pleasure of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In past ages this plan was a mystery, but today this plan is no longer a mystery; it is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's will is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's purpose and plan are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's good pleasure is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The book of Ephesians clearly reveals that the church is God's will, His plan, and His good pleasure.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah, now we have seen this, and today we are in it!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to always be under His enlightenment, from morning to evening, day and night, today and unto eternity, to see that God's plan, His purpose, His will, and His good pleasure are to have the church.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some people have condemned me for being too much for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all should be "too much" for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We care for the church because God cares only for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God dreams about the church and desires to have the church.</S>
