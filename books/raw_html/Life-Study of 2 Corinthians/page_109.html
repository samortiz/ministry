<h2 class="head2">As Unknown and Well Known</h2><p>In verse 9 Paul says, &ldquo;As unknown and well known.&rdquo; The apostles were as unknown in that they did not display themselves. But they were well known in the way of bearing witness to the truth of God. We also should be unknown in the sense that we do not advertise ourselves or make a display of ourselves. As a result, others do not know us. However, at the same time we may be well known because we testify the truth of God. First we should be unknown and then well known. Do not get a name by advertising yourself, but be faithful always to testify God&rsquo;s truth to others.</p><h2 class="head2">As Dying, and Behold, We Live</h2><p>The apostles were as dying in suffering persecutions (1:8-10; 4:11; 1 Cor. 15:31). But they were living in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (2 Cor. 4:10-11). We also should be those who are put to death, those who are as dying, and also those who are living in resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">As Being Disciplined,<br />and Not Being Put to Death</h2><p>In verse 9 Paul also says, &ldquo;As being disciplined and not being put to death.&rdquo; In the superficial realization of the opposers, it was as if the apostles were disciplined. But in the sovereign care of the Lord, they were not being put to death. As we are suffering, those with a very superficial view of things may say, &ldquo;These people are under God&rsquo;s punishment. If they are not being punished by God, why would they suffer so much?&rdquo; Nevertheless, at the very time we are suffering, we are still under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign care and are not put to death. Thus, we are suffering, and yet we live.</p><h2 class="head2">As Made Sorrowful, Yet Always Rejoicing</h2><p>The apostles were as made sorrowful by the negative conditions of the churches (11:28). Yet they were always rejoicing in the sufficient grace and resurrection life of Christ (12:9-10).</p><h2 class="head2">As Poor, Yet Enriching Many</h2><p>In verse 10 Paul also speaks of the apostles &ldquo;as poor yet enriching many.&rdquo; They were as poor in material things, yet enriching many in spiritual riches (Eph. 3:8).</p><h2 class="head2">As Having Nothing,<br />and Possessing All Things</h2><p>Finally, in verse 10, Paul says, &ldquo;As having nothing and possessing all things.&rdquo; They were as having nothing in a human way, but possessing all things in the divine economy.</p><p>We need to ask ourselves if we are the seven kinds of persons described in these verses. We should also check with ourselves concerning the first eighteen qualifications and concerning the three groups of things. What we have in these verses is eighteen &ldquo;ins,&rdquo; three &ldquo;throughs,&rdquo; and seven &ldquo;as&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Regarding the seven kinds of persons, we should be as deceivers and yet true, as unknown and well known, as dying and yet living, as disciplined and yet not being put to death, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet enriching others, and as having nothing and possessing all things. On the one hand, we should seem to be as deceivers, as unknown, as dying, as disciplined, as made sorrowful, as poor, and as having nothing. On the other hand, we should be true, well known, living, not put to death, always rejoicing, enriching many, and possessing all things. Not only should we be rich in spiritual things, but we should also make others rich. Furthermore, we should be well known at least to the angels.</p>
