   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMMEASURABLE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter three of Ephesians reveals three important things regarding Christ: that His riches are unsearchable, that He is making His home in our heart, and that His dimensions are universal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who can say how broad is the breadth or how high is the height?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oh, we may experience the unsearchable riches of the immeasurable Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah for Christ in His immeasurable dimensions!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to ask ourselves whether or not we know such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Christ is immeasurable, He is still making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The immeasurable Christ is a wonderful Person who makes His home in our hearts in a very intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for Christ to make His home in our hearts, we need to be strengthened with power through the Spirit into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The immeasurable Christ who is making home in us is the Spirit, on the one hand, and the very God of fullness, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are strengthened by the Spirit and Christ makes His home in us, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not say that Christ is only the Son, but not the Spirit and not God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Be careful that you are not under the influence of the systematized doctrine of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is too wonderful to be systematized in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He makes His home in us, the Spirit is strengthening us, and we are being filled unto the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you noticed that in Ephesians 3 Paul speaks of the Spirit, Christ, and God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit strengthens us, Christ makes home in us, and we are filled unto the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the Spirit who strengthens us, the Christ who makes His home in us, and the God who fills us unto His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many of us have read the book of Ephesians without ever seeing the vision of such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May we all see that the Christ whom we have received is the Spirit who strengthens and the God who fills us unto His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can testify that the Christ I enjoy is such a wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE DESCENDING AND ASCENDING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 4:9 and 10 Paul says, Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He Who descended is the same Who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ has done a great deal of traveling in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Firstly, He descended from heaven to earth in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He descended further, from earth to Hades, the lower parts of the earth, in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, He ascended from Hades to earth in His resurrection, and from earth to heaven in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through such a journey, He cut the way that He might fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ ascended up on high, to the third heaven, that was not the end of His traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After He ascended, He descended into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Christ is the One who descends, ascends, travels, and comes to us in gracious visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today Christ is still traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is still ascending and descending.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, His traveling takes place mainly within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our experience we may be up or down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are down, Christ comes down to where we are and brings us up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times during the course of a day we may be brought by Christ into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From our experience we can testify that within us Christ descends and ascends; He goes up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although He is always steady, He does not stand still.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, He does a great deal of traveling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is difficult to say where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is He in heaven or on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you say that He is on earth, you may have the sense that He is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if you say that He is in heaven, you may soon realize that He is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, Christ is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to 4:9 and 10, He descended and ascended in order to fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you think that Christ will fill all things in the universe without also filling you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through His descending and ascending, Christ will fill us with Himself.</S>
