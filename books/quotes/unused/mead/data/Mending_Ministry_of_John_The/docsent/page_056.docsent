   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHRIST'S HEAVENLY ADMINISTRATION IN GOD'S UNIVERSAL GOVERNMENT Scripture Reading: Rev 1:5a; 4:1-2; 5:1-8; 6:1; 7:2-3; 8:1-6; 10:1-3; 18:1-2; 19:11-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the verses above, Christ is revealed as the heavenly Administrator in God's universal government.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It may seem that this administration has nothing to do with us; actually it concerns us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous two messages we discussed how Christ's heavenly priesthood is a ministry to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we shall see that His priesthood requires His rulership in order for this ministry to the churches to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE RULER OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice the greeting to the churches in Revelation 1:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The greeting in Paul's Epistles is usually, "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"; this contrasts with the greeting here in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus is called here the faithful Witness; this witness is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He is called the Firstborn of the dead; this is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally He is called the Ruler of the kings of the earth; this is for the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our heavenly Christ is God's faithful Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the Firstborn of the dead to be Head of the church, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth; all nations are under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you doubt His rulership over the nations?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The whole world uses Christ's calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not Alexander the Great nor Napoleon whose calendar is in use.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the nations, whether communist or "Christian" or neutral, use Christ's calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To use His calendar is to acknowledge that He is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The whole world is Christ's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE PRIESTHOOD CARRIED OUT BY THE RULERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without Christ's heavenly rulership it would be hard for His heavenly priesthood to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Circumstances Leading to Your Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just consider how it came about that you were brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Christ were not the Ruler of the whole earth, many of you would have had no chance to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as the Ruler of kings arranges the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was because of His ordering that you were brought to the locality you are in. Then perhaps an economic situation forced you to move from one part of town to another, which happened to be near the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Next door lived a neighbor who happened to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a little while he brought you to a meeting and you got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You got saved because He was interceding for you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knew that you were one of those chosen before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Father, You chose that one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now he is wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Father, there is a church in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Bring him in."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the Father might have answered, "You are the Ruler of the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You administrate to bring him in."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He arranged all kinds of situations in your work and family so that eventually you were brought to New York, then from Manhattan to Queens, and then close to the meeting hall, where you heard the gospel and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your intention might have been to make money in real estate, but all your moves were arranged by Him for His purpose.</S>
