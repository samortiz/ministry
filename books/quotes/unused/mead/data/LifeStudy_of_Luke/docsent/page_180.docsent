   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING OF A GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Man-Savior went through a long process not to save us by snatching us out of hell, but to carry out His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The term dynamic salvation means that God became a man and lived a man s life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although He lived a man s life, He did not express man He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Man-Savior lived such a life on earth, the angels and demons could testify that He was man living a human life for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the Man-Savior s God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The four Gospels tell us of the One who lived the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Luke 2:40-52 we see the Man-Savior growing and advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He became twelve years old, He went with His parents to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover according to custom vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke also tells us that the Lord Jesus began His ministry when He was about thirty years old 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only in the Gospel of Luke are we told what happened to the Lord Jesus at the ages of twelve and thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason is that Luke presents the Lord Jesus as a genuine and typical man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Gospel of Luke we see that the Lord was a real man, a normal man; He was not a magical person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord grew in a normal, human way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, at the age of thirty, He had come to maturity for the divine ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Old Testament, a Levite had to be thirty years of age before he could enter fully into the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, the Man-Savior was fully grown when He entered into His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Man-Savior s living was a God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He was on the earth, the Lord Jesus lived a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This living is a fact recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We thank the Lord that we can study the account of the Lord s God-man living recorded in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more I study the four Gospels and the more messages I give on them, the more convinced I become that the Lord Jesus truly was the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A MAN EXPRESSING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen that the Man-Savior did not live a life expressing man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He lived a man s life, yet this life expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the Lord s living was a God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He lived a life in which God was expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have used the illustration of a hand and a glove to show how God was expressed through the Man-Savior s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A glove contains the hand and expresses the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the hand in the glove moves, the glove also moves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But as the glove moves, it does not express the glove; it expresses the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a similar way, the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man, but He did not express man; He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He lived a life expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When people saw Him, they saw a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, what they saw in Him was the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They did not see a man expressing man; they saw a man expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning the expression of God in the Lord Jesus, John says, We beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Glory is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, when the disciples saw the Lord s glory, they saw the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Apostle John was one of the sons of thunder Mark 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although he was bold and impetuous, he was attracted to the Man-Savior and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He and his brother James were the second group attracted to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first group was composed of Peter and Andrew.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord called John and James, they were in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets Matt 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But they were attracted to the Lord and left the boat and their father and followed Him Matt 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the next three and a half years they saw the God-man s living, although they did not understand what they were seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But after the Man-Savior s resurrection, their eyes were opened, and they began to understand the Man-Savior s God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When John wrote his Gospel, he was very old, probably in his nineties.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He testified that God became flesh and that they beheld His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man was living and walking with them, and in this One they saw the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He was with them in the flesh, they did not understand that the Lord was a man living a human life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But after His resurrection they came to realize that they had seen God expressed in Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Gospels record the history of the Man-Savior s God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now this history needs to be written into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a forthcoming message we shall see that God s desire is to reproduce in us the Man-Savior and His God-man living.</S>
