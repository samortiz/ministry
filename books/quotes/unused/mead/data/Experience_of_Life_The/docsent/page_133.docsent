   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Recognizing Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third proof of our knowing the Body is the recognition of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether or not one knows the Body depends upon whether or not he recognizes authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who do not recognize authority do not know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Knowing the Body and recognizing authority are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Recognition of authority is related to what we have mentioned regarding individualism in the first proof.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If one recognizes authority, he cannot be an individualist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If one wants to determine whether or not he recognizes authority, he simply needs to determine whether or not he is still able to be an individualist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If he is still able to live as an individualist and feels that he can serve God alone without being coordinated with others, he demonstrates that he does not recognize authority, nor has he come to know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Authority can only be manifested in the Body and in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If one member is individualistic and isolated, he has no relationship with others as far as authority is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we have seen that God wants a Body, and that we, being members of this Body, can never go on alone for once we are alone we are disjointed , we will learn to recognize authority, keep our position in the Body, and coordinate with all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is authority?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Authority is simply the authority of Christ the Head, which is revealed in the order of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Take our physical body as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The head is uppermost and is the authority of the whole body; from it, order is expressed throughout the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Below the head are the arms, the trunk, and the legs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the members follow a definite order; therefore, any member, unless it is detached, falls into such an order.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Any member that is attached to the Body surely comes under this order.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On one hand, it is under the authority of some of the members, and on the other hand, some other members are under its authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example: above the palm of the hand is the elbow, and below are the fingers; the elbow has authority over the palm, and the palm has authority over the fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This authority is in accord with their respective order in the body and is also the authority of the head as shown forth in the order of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we speak of authority, we mean the authority of Christ manifested through the order of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we are all members of the Body of Christ, we naturally have our right position and order.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have been taught in our spirit and have been indeed led by God to recognize the flesh, if we have had self dealt with and the natural constitution broken, we will immediately recognize our own order when placed among brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will know who is in front of us and who is behind us, who is in authority over us and over whom we are in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The authority of the Head in me and the authority of the Head in others makes it clear who is over me and who is under me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is just like a family, where brothers and sisters know their own order who should submit to whom and who is the authority of whom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of authority is not assumed nor is it by election, but is the natural order in life, which Christ the Head has manifested in all the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only those living in the flesh, walking according to self-opinion and the natural constitution, are able to engage in ugly conflicts with one another in rivalry for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All those who have learned their lessons can recognize the authority of the Head over the Body and can rest in their own order in a very natural and satisfactory manner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This has nothing to do with either humility or pride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Coming under authority is a natural procedure, far removed from forcing oneself to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of people recognize authority and know the Body, because recognizing authority is equal to knowing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, this matter of knowing the Body can also be called knowing the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not know our order in the Body, we demonstrate that in our experience of life we have not reached the fourth stage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If in the first three stages we have passed through various kinds of dealings, being earnest and thorough, especially in dealing with the flesh, the self-opinion, and the natural constitution, then the Holy Spirit within will lead us in a very natural manner to know our respective order in the Body of Christ, causing our life and service to be full of the flavor of the coordination of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus the Body of Christ will gradually become manifest among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In conclusion, when we have come to know the Body, we can be aware of it, even though we may not know when we attained to this knowing; but if we have it, we will know it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is similar to recovery from an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The exact time of recovery is difficult to discern; but we know that we have recovered, for in appearance as well as in feeling we are different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, in all true spiritual knowing, it is not easy to tell precisely at what day, hour, or minute we gained entrance, but the after-effect is clearly discernible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, if one has a real knowing of the Body, sooner or later he will demonstrate the three proofs which we have mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, he can no longer be an individualist.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, he can tell when others are not in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, among brothers and sisters he knows clearly, without any special effort, his own order in the Body who has authority over him, and over whom he has authority, that is, in whom rests the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These three points are proofs of our knowing the Body.</S>
