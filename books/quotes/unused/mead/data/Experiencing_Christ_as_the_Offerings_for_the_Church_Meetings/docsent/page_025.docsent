   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEMPTION IN OUR DAILY EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the fact we know that Christ redeemed us 1900 years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some teachers have stressed this very much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we need to stress the experiential redemption as well as the factual redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need the redemption in our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every morning when we begin our day the first thing we need to do is to offer Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Don t think this is too repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to realize that life is altogether the totality of repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been eating breakfast 365 days a year for seventy-seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I shouldn t say that I am disgusted and bored with breakfast, so I won t eat it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Life is the totality of repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OFFERING CHRIST AS THE SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>EVERY MORNING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every day you have to repeat the offering of Christ for your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you don t have a good breakfast in the morning you cannot have a good day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In like manner, in the morning you must have a proper offering of Christ as your sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You need to offer Christ as a big bull for your sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to have good health is to have a good breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way to be healthy spiritually is to begin by offering Christ as your sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don t say that you have no heart to offer Christ as a sin offering and that your spirit is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is your laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some who do not eat a proper breakfast say they have no appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have no appetite because they don t eat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more you eat the more you have an appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eating gives you an appetite and even enlarges the capacity of your appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Don t excuse yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is your duty to take a good breakfast, and it is your duty to keep yourself healthy spiritually by offering Christ as a sin offering early in the morning to begin your day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Don t say that you don t have a heart and you don t have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is your obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Try to do this and you will see that you will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope to hear many prayers such as this: Lord, thank You that You have helped me to begin my day by offering You as a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, thank You that You are such an offering to me for this day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But mostly when you pray, you pray in the ordinary, regular, and religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You don t have any prayer offered to the Lord according to the riches of the typology in His holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prayers you have offered are too common, too religious, and too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are no riches inherited from the rich word of God s Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that after reading these messages your prayer would be changed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Don t offer those old-fashioned prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, offer something according to the rich typology of the Word, offering Christ as all the offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST AS OUR TRESPASS OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now let us talk about the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose you began your day by offering Christ as your sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when you came to the breakfast table it was just a mess and breakfast was not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Right away the flame rose up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You were offended with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually you said something to let her know that you were not so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But once you got into the car and were driving on the highway you were condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You asked the Lord to forgive you because you were in your flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thank You, Lord, You are not only my sin offering but also my trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means you offered the Lord Jesus as a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need Him to be our trespass offering many times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At work you have many opportunities to be offended by your colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is another chance for you to trespass.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But by confessing to the Lord you enjoy Him as your trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While you are driving home another driver may offend you, and you may blow the horn at him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then right away you would realize that you have trespassed again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You would offer Christ once more as your trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank You, Lord, You are my unlimited trespass offering.</S>
