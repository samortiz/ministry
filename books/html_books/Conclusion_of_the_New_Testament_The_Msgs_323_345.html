<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(29)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Galatians. The subject of Galatians is Christ replacing the law and being versus religion and tradition. At the time the apostle wrote this Epistle, the Judaizers were exercising a negative influence on many Jewish believers in both Judea and the Gentile lands, especially in Asia Minor. The Judaizers negatively affected not only the Jewish believers but also the Gentile believers, because among the churches, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers were meeting, worshipping, and serving together (Acts 13:1; 18:1-2, 18; Col. 4:7-17). Paul wrote this Epistle not only for the sake of the churches in Galatia but also for the sake of the truth of the gospel. In this book Paul reveals that Christ is unique; He is versus religion, the law, traditions, and rituals. As a human religion, Judaism was the highest product of human culture, and the law, which was even called the law of God, was ordained through angels and given by God through Moses (Rom. 7:22; Gal. 3:19; John 1:17). Although the law, Jewish religion, Jewish traditions, and Jewish rituals are the peak of human culture, Paul in Galatians annuls all of them by exalting Christ and by revealing that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, Christ is everything, is versus everything, and replaces everything.</p>
<h2 class="head3">50. The One Who Rescues Us out of the Religious Age</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Giving Himself for Our Sins That He Might Rescue Usout of the Religious World according to the Will of God</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1:4 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.&rdquo; This verse reveals Christ as the One who rescues us out of the religious world.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Giving Himself for Our Sins That He Might Rescue Us<br />
out of the Religious World</h2>
<p>Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age. An age is a part of the world as the satanic system. An age refers to a section, an aspect, the present or modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which he uses to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. The world system of Satan has different ages or sections. We may regard each decade as a distinct age or section of Satan&rsquo;s world system. The present age is the present section of Satan&rsquo;s cosmos, his world system. Whereas sins are devilish, the present age is satanic. As the devil, the enemy of God is involved with sins, and as Satan, he is involved with the evil age. God&rsquo;s enemy is subtle, lurking behind sins and the evil age. Apart from the crucifixion of Christ, we have no way to deal with sins, behind which the devil hides, or the evil age, behind which Satan hides. Christ was crucified for our sins so that He might rescue us from this evil age. This indicates that only Christ can save us from the devil, Satan. Both sins and the evil age have been dealt with by the crucified Christ. He gave Himself for us on the cross according to the will of God. He died for our sins so that we might be delivered from the present evil age. Therefore, if we would be delivered from this evil age, our sins must be dealt with. If we, through the preaching of the gospel, help others to receive the forgiveness of sins, they will begin to realize that they need to be rescued from the present evil age.</p>
<p>Literally, the Greek word translated <em>rescue</em> in Galatians 1:4 means &ldquo;to pluck out of, to draw out of, or to extricate from.&rdquo; According to the context of this book, the present evil age here refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. Paul tells us in verses 13 and 14 how he conducted himself in the present evil age, the religious world under Satan&rsquo;s usurpation: &ldquo;You have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.&rdquo; That in this book the present evil age mainly refers to the religious world and not the secular world is also confirmed by 6:14-15, where circumcision is considered a part of the world&mdash;the religious world, which to the apostle Paul was crucified. Here the apostle emphasizes that the purpose of Christ&rsquo;s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law (3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word Paul indicates what he intended to deal with: he wanted to rescue the churches, which were distracted by Judaism with its law, and bring them back to the grace of the gospel.</p>
<p>At the time of John 10 God&rsquo;s people, His sheep, were in the fold of Judaism. But as Galatians 1 makes clear, Christ came to bring His sheep out of the fold and to form them with the Gentile believers into one flock, the church (John 10:16). Hence, the fold is religion, whereas the flock is the one universal church, the one Body of Christ, consisting of all the believers in Christ. Today in the sight of God the various denominations, sects, and independent groups are folds. Furthermore, a fold is anything formed into a legality. Anything that is first used by God and then becomes a legality is a fold. For example, baptism by immersion is correct, but if we make this a legality, we will form another fold. Today Christ is seeking to rescue His sheep out of the various religious folds and to bring them together as the one flock.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came into the fold, opened the door, and led the sheep out of the fold. The Judaizers crucified Him, but through His death on the cross, the Lord gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the religious fold. The principle is the same both with the believers in Paul&rsquo;s time and with us today.</p><h2 class="head5">2) According to the Will of God</h2>
<p>Although many Christians know that Christ died for our sins to deliver us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and the lake of fire, few realize that Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us from the religious world. This is a crucial matter because Christ gave Himself for our sins to rescue us out of the religious world, not according to His choice but according to the will of God. It was not because Christ was rejected by the Jews that He hated Judaism and went to the cross in order to rescue His disciples out of Judaism. Rather, it was according to God&rsquo;s will, that is, His plan, His economy, that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us out of the Jewish religion. In His economy God planned that Christ would rescue His chosen people out of Judaism, the law, traditions, and rituals.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians reveals that the will of God is to have the church as a living Body for Christ (1:22-23; 3:10-11); it is not to have an organization but an organism. The will of God is not to have the Jewish religion or the religion of Christianity. Rather, it is to have the organic Body of Christ. The will of God is not to have circumcision or uncircumcision. Rather, it is to have a new creation (Gal. 6:15), which is the church as the new man (Col. 3:10).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; According to the context of this chapter, the will of God is the Body life (vv. 4-5). We need to enter into the Body life. As long as we are outside the Body life, we are outside God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In contrast to the will of God, which is to have the Body of Christ, Satan&rsquo;s aim is to systematize people into his world and keep them away from God&rsquo;s will. In Paul&rsquo;s day Satan used Judaism to systematize all Pharisees, scribes, priests, and elders among the Jewish people. Today Satan uses the religion of Christianity to systematize many of the Lord&rsquo;s people away from God&rsquo;s will, the organic Body of Christ. Just as Paul was delivered out of the age of Judaism, today genuine believers and seekers must be delivered out of the religious system of Christianity to accomplish God&rsquo;s will to have the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. To Him Being the Glory Forever and Ever</h2>
<p>After mentioning that Christ died on the cross to deliver us from Jewish religion according to the will of God, Paul declares, &ldquo;To whom be the glory forever and ever&rdquo; (Gal. 1:5).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. God Having Called Us in His Grace</h2>
<p>In verse 6 Paul tells us that God has called us in the grace of Christ. The grace of Christ is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;processed to become our enjoyment. This grace is versus the law of Moses. John 1:17 says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In John 1:16 we are told that &ldquo;of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; To receive grace upon grace is to continually receive of the processed Triune God for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Christ gave Himself for our sins on the cross that He might rescue us out of the Jewish religion. On the other hand, God has called us in the grace of Christ for the purpose of bringing us out of the Jewish religion and into Christ as the green pasture for our enjoyment of Him. Christ is the living and rich pasture as the feeding place for the sheep. As believers in Christ, we should enjoy Him as our pasture for us to feed on and receive nourishment for growth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (John 10:10b). This means that because He is their pasture, Christ came to impart Himself as life to His sheep. As long as the sheep stay in the pasture, they will have the abundant supply of life. By feeding on the pasture, the sheep will enjoy the abundant life supply, for the Lord Jesus is their abundant life. They will enjoy Him and experience Him as their life.</p>
<p>The pasture is a place of tender grass, a place full of the supply of life. When sheep are in the pasture, they do not lack food. Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In our daily Christian life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.</p>
<p>According to John 10 Christ came as the good Shepherd to enter into the fold, which signifies the Jewish religion with the law. God used the Jewish religion as a fold to protect His chosen people, just as a shepherd uses a fold to protect his sheep during the night, a storm, or winter weather. The Jewish religion, as a fold, was sed as a shelter to keep God&rsquo;s people in the custody of the law for Christ. But when Christ came as the true Shepherd, He entered into the fold and led His believers out of the fold, the Jewish religion, into Himself as the green pasture to feed them as His flock.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul was charged by the Lord to lead God&rsquo;s people out of the fold of religion into Christ as the living pasture. Although Paul was sent to preach the gospel in the Gentile lands, when he visited Gentile cities, he often went to the synagogues. He went to the synagogues not to participate in the Jewish religion but to preach the word of God&rsquo;s gospel (Acts 13:14-15; 17:1-2; 19:8), just as the Lord Jesus did in His ministry (Matt. 4:23; Luke 4:16). In the synagogues Paul spoke the word of God so that God&rsquo;s chosen people might hear the Lord&rsquo;s voice and follow Him as their Shepherd to go out of the fold of the Jewish religion and to enter into Christ as the pasture to feed on Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(30)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">51. The One Revealed in the Apostle</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1:16 Christ is presented as the One revealed in the apostle. When Saul of Tarsus, on his way to Damascus to bind those who call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, was opposing Christ and persecuting the churches, Christ appeared to him. When Christ met him there, he saw Christ, was captured by the appearing of Christ, and became Paul the apostle. Years after his conversion, the apostle declared in Galatians 1:15-16 that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him. Here Paul did not say that Christ revealed Himself to him but that the Father in His pleasure revealed Christ into Paul. This revelation was not merely an outward vision but an inward seeing. Paul had an inner vision of Christ; inwardly he began to see Christ. This inner vision made him and qualified him to be an apostle in order that he might present the very Christ who had been revealed in him, rather than merely teaching doctrines and theology according to a certain religion.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Apostle Receiving the Gospel<br />
through the Revelation of Him</h2>
<p>In 1:11-12 Paul says, &ldquo;I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Paul&rsquo;s gospel was not taught by man, that man was not the source of his gospel, and that he received a marvelous revelation of the gospel directly from the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The apostle received the gospel through the revelation of Christ. Here the revelation of Christ does not refer merely to a revelation received through Jesus Christ or to the revelation concerning Christ. Rather, it refers to the person of Christ, who was revealed in the apostle. Paul received the gospel through such a personal revelation. Revelation is the opening of the veil in order to show something hidden from view. One day God opened the veil to Paul, and he immediately saw the revealed Christ.</p>
<p>The gospel that the apostle received through the revelation of Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s revelation in the New Testament (Rom. 1:1, 9). Paul&rsquo;s gospel is a revelation of the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Gal. 3:2, 5, 14). His gospel is centered on the Triune God being our life in order to be one with us and to make us one with Him so that we may be the Body of Christ to express Christ in a corporate way (Rom. 8:11; 12:4-5; Eph. 1:22-23). The focal point of Paul&rsquo;s gospel is God Himself in His Trinity becoming the processed all-inclusive Spirit to be life and everything to us for our enjoyment so that He and we may be one to express Him for eternity (Gal. 4:4, 6; 3:13-14, 26-28; 6:15).</p>
<p>Christ, a living person, is the focus of Paul&rsquo;s gospel. Hence, the book of Galatians is emphatically Christ-centered. Christ was crucified to redeem us out of the curse of the law and rescue us out of the present evil religious course of the world (3:1, 13; 1:4, 15-16). Christ was resurrected from the dead that He might live in us (v. 1; 2:20). We were baptized into Christ, being identified with Him, and we have put on Christ, clothing ourselves with Him; thus, we are in Christ and have become of Him (3:27-29; 5:24). Christ has been revealed in us, He is now living in us, and He will be formed in us (1:16; 2:20; 4:19). To Christ the law has conducted us, and in Christ we are all sons of God (3:24, 26). In Christ we inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit (v. 14). In Christ we all are one (v. 28). We should not be deprived of all profit from Christ and thus be separated, severed, from Him (5:4). We need Christ to supply us with grace in our spirit that we may live Him (6:18). God&rsquo;s desire is that His chosen people receive His Son into them; this is the gospel (1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. It Pleasing God to Reveal Him,<br />
the Son of God, in the Apostle</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1:15 and 16a Paul says, &ldquo;It pleased God, who set me apart from my mother&rsquo;s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me.&rdquo; The Son of God, as the embodiment and expression of God the Father (John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb. 1:3), is life to us (John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (1:12; Gal. 4:5-6). As the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16), He is far superior to Judaism and its traditions (Gal. 1:13-14). The Judaizers had bewitched the Galatians into considering that the ordinances of the law were above the Son of the living God. Hence, in the opening of this Epistle the apostle testified that he had been deeply involved and had become far advanced in the realm of Judaism, but that God had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God&rsquo;s eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience he realized that there was no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions handed down from his forefathers.</p><h2 class="head5">1) God&rsquo;s Pleasure to Reveal His Son in Us</h2>
<p>In 1:16 Paul emphasizes the fact that the Son of God was revealed <em>in</em> him. This indicates that God&rsquo;s revealing of His Son to us is in us; it is not outward but inward, not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. It is not an objective revelation but a subjective one.</p>
<p>Moreover, Paul says that it <em>pleased</em> God to reveal His Son in him. This indicates that to reveal the Son of God brings pleasure to God. Nothing is more pleasing to God than the unveiling, the revelation, of the living person of the Son of God.</p>
<p>At the time appointed by God, when Saul, zealous in his religion, was persecuting the church, the Son of God was revealed to him. God could bear with Saul&rsquo;s zeal for the traditions of his fathers, for this produced a dark background against which to reveal Christ. At a time which was pleasing to Him, God revealed His Son in Saul of Tarsus. God was pleased to reveal to him the living person of the Son of God. To reveal His Son in us is a pleasure to God. It is Christ, the Son of God&mdash;not the law&mdash;in whom God the Father is always pleased (Matt. 3:17; 12:18; 17:5).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Son, a living person, is versus man&rsquo;s religion. This was true at the time of Saul of Tarsus, it has been true throughout the centuries, and it is true today. Instead of focusing his attention on this living person, man has a natural tendency to direct his attention to religion with its tradition. But from Genesis 1 through Revelation 22 the Bible reveals a living person. God cares only for this living person.</p>
<p>The record of the experience of the disciples with the Lord Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration illustrates this (Matt. 17:1-8). After bringing Peter, James, and John up into a high mountain apart, the Lord Jesus &ldquo;was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light&rdquo; (v. 2). Along with the other two disciples, Peter saw the Lord&rsquo;s glory. He also saw Moses and Elijah speaking with Him. Although it is doubtful that Moses and Elijah were in glory, they nonetheless were speaking with the glorified Jesus. According to Matthew 17:4, Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&rdquo; In making this suggestion, Peter was elevating Moses and Elijah to the same level as that of the Lord Jesus. He was heir of the centuries-old tradition concerning Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets. To the Jews, Moses and Elijah were the representatives of the entire Old Testament. Hence, even on the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter was zealous for the traditions regarding Moses and Elijah. But while Peter was still speaking, the record says, &ldquo;Behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!&rdquo; (v. 5). Moses and Elijah then disappeared from the scene. When the disciples lifted up their eyes, &ldquo;they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone&rdquo; (v. 8). This indicates that in the eyes of God there is no place for religion or tradition&mdash;only the living person of His Son has a place.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Christ, the Son of God,<br />
Being the Embodiment of the Triune God<br />
Realized as the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>It is significant that in Galatians 1:15 and 16 Paul does not say that God revealed Christ in him but that God revealed His Son in him. Speaking of Christ does not lead to the same kind of involvement as does speaking of the Son. The reason for this difference is that whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit. According to the writings of Paul, to have the Son is to have both the Father and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the Spirit for our enjoyment (2 Cor. 13:14). Hence, when Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him, this means that the One revealed in him was the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the processed, all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles we see that the Son is the mystery of God, the embodiment of God, and the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (Col. 2:2, 9). One day, through incarnation, the Son of God became a man called the last Adam, who, through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Putting all these verses together, we see that in incarnation the Son of God, the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, became a man and that in resurrection this One is now the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ as the Son of God, there are two &ldquo;becomings.&rdquo; According to John 1:14 the Word, the Son of God, became flesh. In other words, He became a man. Furthermore, according to 1 Corinthians 15:45 this One, called the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. This is the reason that Paul can say explicitly in 2 Corinthians 3:17 that the Lord is the Spirit. The Son of God is thus the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit. This wonderful person is versus man&rsquo;s religion.</p><h2 class="head5">3) God&rsquo;s Unique Intention to Give Us<br />
His Son as a Living Person</h2>
<p>The focal point of the Bible is not the practices, doctrines, or ordinances. Rather, it is the living person of the Son of God who is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit for us to enjoy Him, partake of His riches, and live Him (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; Phil. 1:19; Gal. 6:18). The heart of God is fully occupied with the living person of His Son. God&rsquo;s unique intention is to give us His Son as a living person. However, because of the fall, we are easily distracted to care for other things in place of Christ. It is crucial for us to have a vision of this all-inclusive living person. This person includes the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; He includes divinity and humanity. Although this living person is so all-inclusive, He is very practical to us, for, as the life-giving Spirit, He is in our regenerated spirit. On the one hand, He is in the heavens as the Lord, the Christ, the King, the Head, the High Priest, and the heavenly Minister (Acts 10:36; 1 Tim. 6:15; Heb. 4:14-15; 7:26; 8:2). On the other hand, He is in our spirit to be everything to us (2 Tim. 4:22). He is God, the Father, the Redeemer, the Savior, man, life, light, and the reality of every positive thing. This is the living person of the Son of God.</p>
<p>From the time this living person was revealed in Saul, the veil was taken away and Saul was enlightened concerning the Son of God. Henceforth, he cared for this person and no longer cared for religion or tradition. We need to pray that we may see such a vision of the living person of the Son of God and care for Him more than anything else. Without this living person as the reality and content of the church life, even the church life will become a tradition. It is vital that we see this living person.</p>
<p>We should not treasure anything, including our Bible knowledge or spiritual experience and attainments, in place of this living person. Daily and hourly, we need to experience this living person. The church is the Body of this person, His practical and living expression. As the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, He is within us to be whatever we need. He is versus everything. Without Him, everything is a tradition made either by others or by ourselves.</p>
<p>Apart from Christ, the living person of the Son of God, whatever we have is religion. This living person is the embodiment of the processed, all-inclusive Triune God realized in our spirit as the life-giving Spirit. In our spirit we enjoy Him, experience Him, partake of His riches, and live Him. To be a Christian is to be one who is occupied with the living person, not with religion. Judaism is a religion formed by man in dead letters with vain traditions. But the Son of God is life, the uncreated, eternal life of God (John 14:6). For our experience and enjoyment, this One is the all-inclusive Spirit with the divine reality (1:14; 1 John 5:6).</p>
<p>As a living person, Christ is spiritual and mysterious. Apart from God&rsquo;s revelation of His Son in us, no human being would be able to see this living person. Christians may read the Bible and study it carefully but see very little of Christ. From the beginning of the Bible to the end, especially in the New Testament, Christ occupies the central place. God&rsquo;s revelation throughout the Scriptures is altogether focused on Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) The Need to Drop Our Concepts,<br />
to Turn Our Heart to the Lord,<br />
to Pay Attention to Our Spirit, and to Spend Time<br />
in the Word in a Spirit of Prayer in Order to Receive<br />
a Subjective Revelation of the Son of God</h2>
<p>Concerning the revelation of God&rsquo;s Son in us, Paul covers two cases in 2 Corinthians 3 and 4&mdash;the case of the Jews in particular and the case of the unbelievers in general. When the Jews read the Old Testament, they read it with their understanding veiled. In 2 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, &ldquo;Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.&rdquo; Here the veil refers to the religion of Judaism. In 4:4 Paul goes on to say that the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of those who do not believe. The god of this age is Satan. Those who are blinded or veiled think that they do not worship anything. Actually, their god is Satan. Atheists worship Satan without knowing what they are doing. Nearly all people today, whether primitive or highly cultured, have been blinded by the god of this age.</p>
<p>We need to apply this word about veils to ourselves. It is crucial that we be on the alert, for it is possible for anything that is not Christ Himself to be used as a veil by Satan, the subtle one. If we would receive the revelation of the Son of God, we need to drop our concepts. Every concept, whether spiritual or carnal, is a veil. To have revelation we need to drop our concepts.</p>
<p>God today is shining everywhere. This age of grace is an age of light. God is shining, and the Bible also is shining. Moreover, the all-inclusive Spirit moving on earth is full of grace. However, even while the Bible is shining and the Spirit is moving, many still do not receive revelation. The reason is that they hold to certain concepts and are veiled by these concepts.</p>
<p>With respect to receiving revelation, there is no problem on God&rsquo;s side. On His side everything is ready. The problem is altogether on our side. We need to drop the veils; that is, we need to drop our concepts. It is important for us to pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me to drop everything that is a veil.&rdquo; If we hold on to our concepts while reading the Bible, we will be like the ancient Jews who had a veil on their mind whenever the Scriptures were read. But if we drop our concepts as we read the Word, we will read it with an unveiled face. Then the light will shine into us subjectively.</p>
<p>We also need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I trust in You to defeat the god of this age. Apart from You, I do not worship anything. Lord, I turn my heart to You, and I drop all my concepts. I don&rsquo;t want to worship anyone other than You.&rdquo; If we pray in this way, the light will shine, and we will receive revelation. If we drop our concepts and turn our heart to the Lord, the veils will be taken away, and the god of this age will have no ground in our being.</p>
<p>The revelation of the Son of God is an inward revelation. This inward revelation is in our spirit through our enlightened mind. Because the mind plays an important part, it is crucial that we drop our concepts, all of which are in the mind. If we hold on to the concepts in our mind, the revelation may be in our spirit, but it will not be able to penetrate our veiled mentality. We need to drop our concepts so that our mind may be released and become transparent. Then when the Spirit shines in our spirit, this shining will come into our transparent mind. Then we shall receive an inward revelation.</p>
<p>If we would see the revelation of Christ, we must also turn our hearts to the Lord. According to 2 Corinthians 3:16, when the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. The more we turn our heart to the Lord, the less ground the god of this age will have in our life and in our being. We should tell the Lord that we hold on to nothing besides Him and that our heart is wholly for Him. Then we will be under the shining of the heavenly light, and we will receive the revelation of the living person of the Son of God.</p>
<p>This inward revelation of Christ is subjective, and this subjective revelation is given in our spirit by the Spirit (Eph. 1:17; 3:5). Both our spirit and the Spirit of God are realities. We cannot deny that within us we have a human spirit. Neither can we deny that the divine Spirit is in our spirit. In order to receive the revelation of the Son of God, we must take care of the depths of our being, that is, our spirit. It is in our spirit that the Spirit is shining, revealing Christ in us and speaking to us concerning Christ. It is also helpful to pray-read the word, especially verses from the Epistles of Paul (6:17-18). This will enable us to see Christ and to receive a subjective revelation of this living person.</p>
<p>In brief, in order to receive an inward, subjective, and spiritual revelation, we all must learn to drop our concepts, turn our heart to the Lord, pay attention to our spirit, and pray over verses from the writings of Paul. Then the Spirit will enlighten us and speak to us of Christ. As a result, we shall receive a subjective revelation of the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head5">5) Christ Revealed in Us Being the Center of God&rsquo;s Plan</h2>
<p>Christ revealed in us is the center of God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s plan is neither to have a religion nor to have many religious works accomplished. God&rsquo;s plan is to reveal Christ into us, to make Christ our life and everything, and to regenerate and transform us to be members of Christ.</p>
<p>When God the Father reveals His Son in us, He sows Christ into us as the seed of life. For God to reveal Christ, His Son, in us is for God to dispense Christ into us. When the Son of God is revealed in us, something divine is added to us. Selection and calling do not cause anything to be added into us, but the revelation of the Son of God in us causes divinity to be added to our humanity. God Himself is added into our being to become our life. He who has the Son has life (1 John 5:12). Hence, to have the Son of God revealed in us means to have God added to us to become our life.</p>
<p>God made the apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him (Gal. 1:15), and revealing His Son in him (v. 16). At the time of Paul&rsquo;s conversion, God was pleased to reveal Christ in him. Paul then realized that what matters to God is not for him to keep the law, to worship Him, or to do good works but to have Christ, the Son of God, as a living person revealed in him. The central point of the gospel is that the Son of God would come into us as our person to become our life and life supply, to be formed in us, to make Himself one with us, and even to become us.</p>
<p>The New Testament tells us that Paul was a pattern to all the believers (1 Tim. 1:15-16). Therefore, just as God revealed Christ into Paul, God must reveal Christ into each of the believers. We, the believers who have been genuinely regenerated and saved, can testify that since the time we heard the gospel, there has been an unveiling of Christ within us. We could not have been saved unless we had had such an unveiling of Christ within us. From the time we heard the gospel, the scenery of a person, the Son of God, began to shine within us, and day by day He is unveiled to us more and more. Today Christ is still shining in us, and we are continually seeing more of Him. This unveiling of Christ is God&rsquo;s doing. Every aspect of the Christian life comes out of this unveiling. We live the Christian life according to the Christ whom we have seen. Our Christian life comes out of the Christ whom we see day by day. Christ must be continually revealed in us. Since the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, God&rsquo;s unveiling of Christ should continue in us; this unveiling should never cease.</p>
<p>The more revelation we receive of the Son of God, the more He will live in us. The more He lives in us, the more He will become to us the unique and central blessing of the gospel which God promised to Abraham. This means that He will be to us the all-inclusive land realized as the all-inclusive, processed, life-giving Spirit. If we drop our concepts, turn our heart to the Lord, pay attention to the spirit, and spend time in the Word, Christ will be revealed in us, live in us, and be formed in us. Day by day He will become more of an enjoyment to us. As a result, this living person will make us a new creation in a practical way. The book of Galatians eventually brings us to the new creation by way of the inward revelation of the living person of the Son of God. Paul&rsquo;s burden in writing the book of Galatians, and our need today, is that we be brought into a state where we are full of the revelation of the Son of God and thereby become a new creation with Christ living in us, being formed in us, and being enjoyed by us continually as the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. That the Apostle Might Announce Him<br />
as the Gospel among the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Christ was revealed in Paul so that he might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles (Gal. 1:16). From the time he first met the Lord on his way to Damascus, God&rsquo;s revelation of Christ began to shine within Paul. He received not only a revelation of Christ but also a burden to preach, to minister, and to present this One to others. The apostle Paul did not preach the law but announced Christ, the Son of God, as the gospel; he announced not merely the doctrine concerning Him but the living person Himself.</p>
<p>The proper preaching of the gospel is not the preaching of a doctrine; it is the preaching of the person of the Son of God. The Son of God is the embodiment of the Father and is realized as the Spirit. To preach the gospel is to preach this person. Whenever we preach the gospel, we must impress those who hear us with the living person of the Son of God. No matter what the subject of our gospel message may be, the focal point of our preaching must be this living person.</p>
<p>According to Acts 26:16 the Lord&rsquo;s appearing made Saul of Tarsus a witness both of the things in which he had seen Him and of the things in which He would appear to him. The Lord said to Saul that He would reveal other things to him, not in the way of mere teaching but by means of His appearing. We must see the things concerning Christ by having Christ appear to us. All that the apostle Paul ministered to others were the things in which the Lord appeared to him. Being a witness of Christ is not a matter of teaching and knowledge; it is a matter of appearing and vision. The things in which the Lord appears to us are the things which we must minister to others. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, appear to me that in Your appearing I may see something and then tell people of what I have seen.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, the Lord Jesus will appear to us, and His appearing will give us a vision. His appearing will make us witnesses; we will tell others of what we have seen in the presence of the living Lord. It pleased God to reveal His Son in us that we might announce Him as the gospel. Our preaching must be the issue of what we have seen. We do not preach doctrine; instead, we minister and witness what we have seen in Christ&rsquo;s appearing. After we have seen the vision, we need to contact others, telling them that Christ has appeared to us and that we have seen Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(31)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">52. The Sphere of Freedom</h2>
<p>Galatians 2:4 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the sphere of freedom. In this verse Paul speaks of &ldquo;the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.&rdquo; Such strong negative terms as <em>false brothers, stole in,</em> and <em>spy out</em> should impress us with the fact that freedom in Christ is a great and precious matter. Here we see the contrast between freedom in Christ versus slavery under law. The Judaizers perverted the gospel of Christ by secretly bringing the observances of the law into the church, and they troubled the genuine brothers in Christ in order to bring them into slavery under the law (1:7). The Judaizers were slaves under law; they did not realize how much they were suffering under the slavery of law. Christ is the Emancipator of the Jewish people. Exodus reveals that Christ, typified by Moses, delivered the children of Israel from the slavery of Pharaoh (3:8; Heb. 3:2). In the New Testament, Christ came to release them again from another form of slavery, the slavery of law. In Christ the believers have freedom from the slavery of law.</p>
<p>Freedom in Christ has at least four aspects. First, freedom in Christ implies liberation from the bondage of the law. Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law, its ordinances, practices, and regulations (Gal. 2:19). Anyone who tries to keep the law makes himself a debtor to the ordinances, practices, and regulations of the law. Because we all have human shortcomings, we cannot fulfill the requirements of the law. Throughout history, only one person&mdash;the Lord Jesus&mdash;has kept the law (Matt. 5:17). The requirements of the law are too heavy for us to fulfill. Hence, if we try to keep the law, we will come under the yoke of the law, place ourselves under the slavery of the law, and serve the law as a slave (Acts 15:10). Freedom in Christ, however, liberates us from all such obligation.</p>
<p>Second, freedom in Christ includes satisfaction with a rich, supporting supply. If we are free outwardly but do not have anything to support us or satisfy us, this freedom is not genuine. Proper freedom is not only liberation from obligation; it is also full satisfaction because of an adequate supply. In contrast, under the law there is no satisfaction because there is no supply. The law makes demands, but it offers no supply to meet those demands.</p>
<p>Third, to be free in Christ is to enjoy true rest without being under the heavy burden to keep the law. If we strive to keep the law, we will not have true rest because our efforts to keep the law place us under a heavy burden. But in Christ we have true rest.</p>
<p>With slavery under law, it is not possible for us to be at rest. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; This promise was spoken especially to those who were trying to keep the law. It refers in particular to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations. To have rest here means to be set free from labor and burden under law and religion. In making this declaration, the Lord indicated that those who are striving to keep the law and are burdened under the law should come to Him so that He would set them free from the yoke of the law and give them true rest in Him.</p>
<p>Fourth, freedom in Christ implies the full enjoyment of the living Christ. Those who place themselves under obligation to the law have no satisfaction, rest, or enjoyment. But because we are free in Him, we enjoy all that He is.</p>
<p>If we would have a proper definition of freedom in Christ, a definition that matches our experience, we need to see that such a freedom involves liberation from obligations, satisfaction through the Lord&rsquo;s rich supply, genuine rest, and the enjoyment of Christ. Those who have this kind of freedom are not enslaved by anything. Although Satan may sometimes put us into a difficult situation, we can still be at rest. We need not be enslaved by any situation. Instead, we can enjoy the Lord. This means that we are free in the depths of our being. This is our freedom in Christ.</p>
<p>Freedom in Christ is a treasure. Satan, the subtle one, sent in the Judaizers to spy out this freedom and to deprive the Galatian believers of this treasure. He wanted to take away their liberation from obligation, their satisfaction, their rest, and their enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>Those who strive to keep the law do so not by the Spirit but by their flesh (Gal. 3:3). For this reason, they do not participate in God&rsquo;s promise and have no enjoyment of life in grace by the Spirit. Life, grace, and the Spirit have nothing to do with the keeping of the law. The law does not have life, does not give grace, and does not depend on the Spirit. Hence, in the keeping of the law we have no life, grace, or Spirit. Instead, we have only our striving in the flesh.</p>
<p>As we consider the matter of freedom in Christ, we need to see that Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life by grace. Grace is God processed to be our enjoyment. In 1:15 Paul says that God called him through His grace. This indicates that when God called us, He called us by Himself as the One processed to be our enjoyment. Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life into us by the Triune God who has been processed to become our enjoyment. As a result, we have been united to the Triune God. In this organic union we are absolutely one with the Triune God and released from slavery under law. In this union we enjoy the freedom that is ours in Christ.</p>
<p>We should praise the Lord for our freedom in Christ. We are not in slavery under law; we enjoy freedom in Christ. We are free from obligation, and we have satisfaction, rest, and enjoyment in Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">53. The Means of Justification</h2>
<p>In Galatians 2:16 Christ is revealed as the means of justification: &ldquo;Knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fallen man cannot be justified by works of law. In 2:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law.&rdquo; At the end of this verse Paul declares, &ldquo;Out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.&rdquo; The word <em>flesh</em> in 2:16 means fallen man, who has become flesh (Gen. 6:3). No such man will be justified out of works of law. Furthermore, in Galatians 3:11 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;That by law no one is justified before God is evident.&rdquo; In these verses Paul tells us clearly that no one is justified out of works of law.</p>
<p>The New Testament says that if we keep all the commandments except one, we transgress the whole law (James 2:10). Romans 7 proves that we cannot keep all the commandments. In verse 7 Paul refers to the commandment about coveting: &ldquo;Neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, &lsquo;You shall not covet.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then in verse 8 he goes on to say, &ldquo;But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind.&rdquo; The more Paul tried to keep this commandment, the more he failed. This indicates that it is impossible for fallen man to keep all of God&rsquo;s commandments. We simply do not have the ability to keep the law. As Paul says in Romans 7:14, the law is spiritual, but we are fleshy, sold under sin. Therefore, out of works of law no flesh will be justified.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s New Testament economy we are not to keep the law. On the contrary, we are justified through faith in Christ (Gal. 2:16). Faith in Christ denotes an organic union through believing. The faith in Christ by which we are justified is related to our appreciation of the person of the Son of God. In our preaching of the gospel we must present Christ as a treasure. We need to present Christ as the most precious One to people. The more we describe Him and speak of His preciousness, the more something will be infused into the being of the listeners. This infusion will become their faith, and this faith will cause them to respond to our preaching. In this way they will appreciate the person we present to them. This appreciation is their faith in Christ. Out of their appreciation for the Lord Jesus, they will want to possess Him. The Christ who has been preached to them will become in them the faith by which they believe. Faith is Christ preached into them to become their capacity to believe through their appreciation of Him.</p>
<p>The genuine experiential definition of faith is the preciousness of Jesus infused into us. Through such an infusion, we spontaneously have faith in the Lord Jesus. This definition of faith matches our experience. The teaching of doctrine did not impress us with the preciousness of the person of the Son of God. But one day we heard a living message filled with the preciousness of Christ. When His preciousness was infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, we spontaneously began to appreciate the Lord Jesus and believe in Him. We said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. I treasure You.&rdquo; This is what it means to have faith in Christ.</p>
<p>This faith creates an organic union in which we and Christ are one. Therefore, the expression <em>out of faith in Christ</em> actually denotes an organic union accomplished by believing in Christ. The term <em>in Christ</em> refers to this organic union. Before we believed in Christ, there was a great separation between us and Christ. We were we, and Christ was Christ. But through believing we were joined to Christ and became one with Him. Now we are in Christ, and Christ is in us.</p>
<p>This is an organic union, a union in life. This union is illustrated by the grafting of a branch of one tree into another tree. Through faith in Christ we are grafted into Christ. Through this process of spiritual grafting, two lives are grafted and become one.</p>
<p>Many Christians have a shallow understanding of justification by faith. How could Christ be our righteousness if we were not organically united to Him? It is by means of our organic union with Christ that God can reckon Christ as our righteousness. Because we and Christ are one, whatever belongs to Him is ours. This is the basis upon which God counts Christ as our righteousness.</p>
<p>Just as a poor woman is united in marriage to a wealthy man and thus participates in the wealth of her husband, through our organic union with Christ, we share whatever Christ is and has. As soon as this union takes place, in the eyes of God Christ becomes us, and we become one with Him. Only in this way can we be justified before God.</p>
<p>Many Christians have a mere doctrinal understanding of justification by faith. According to their concept, Christ is the just One, the righteous One on the throne in the presence of God. When we believe in Christ, God reckons Christ to be our righteousness. This understanding of justification is very shallow. In order to be justified by faith in Christ, we need to believe in the Lord Jesus out of an appreciation of His preciousness. As Christ&rsquo;s preciousness is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, we spontaneously appreciate the Lord and call on Him. This is genuine believing. Through such a believing, we and Christ become one. Therefore, God must reckon Him as our righteousness.</p>
<p>When we heard the gospel, we began to sense the Lord&rsquo;s preciousness. This gave rise to the living faith that joined us to Christ organically. From that time onward, Christ and we became one in life and in reality. Therefore, justification by faith is not merely a matter of position. It is also an organic matter, a matter in life. The organic union with Christ is accomplished spontaneously through the living faith produced by our appreciation of Him. This is to be justified through faith in Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">54. The One Who Has Given Himself Up for the Believers and Who Lives in Them</h2>
<p>In Galatians 2:20 Christ is presented as the One who has given Himself up for the believers and who lives in them. We must experience and enjoy Christ in this aspect. It is only when we come to know Christ as the One who lives in us and we live by Him, not by ourselves, that we can enjoy Christ as the One who rescues us out of religion. When we live by Him as our life, we realize that any kind of religion is bondage or slavery and does not help us to live Christ; rather, it hinders us from living Him. In other words, when we live a life that is Christ Himself, we discover that even the highest religion is only bondage and does not help us to progress in the way of life. By knowing Christ as the One who lives in us and by living by Christ through our faith in Him, we should experience and enjoy Him as the One who rescues us from religion.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.The Believers Having Been Crucified with Him<br />
and Living No Longer</h2>
<p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul declares, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live.&rdquo; When Christ was crucified, according to God&rsquo;s economy we were included in Him. This is an accomplished fact. Moreover, this is not a matter of doctrine; it is a matter of revelation. In our Christian life there should come a day when the Holy Spirit shows us that we have already been crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us. When we truly see this fact, we will not do anything by ourselves, for a dead person can neither do good nor have any hope. From that day onward, we simply will not be able to make any resolution or have any hope in ourselves. If we see that we ourselves were crucified with Christ when He died on the cross to save us, and if we praise the Lord for this fact, then He will have more ground in us, and He will be expressed through us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to terminate us and put us into the tomb so that we may receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. Having received Him, we should let Him live in us. It is crucial to see that we have been crucified and that it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us. If we realize this, we will care only for Christ and will say, &ldquo;God, now I know that You do not want anything of me. You want nothing but Christ. I have been crucified, terminated, and finished so that I can live Christ and magnify Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Believers Living by Him Who Lives in Them through Their Faith in Him</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Believers Living by Him Who Lives in Them</h2>
<p>In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; We have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in us through His resurrection. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This point is fully developed in all the following chapters of Galatians, where the Spirit is presented and emphasized as the One whom we have received as life and in whom we should live.</p>
<p><em>No longer I</em> in verse 2:20 does not indicate an exchanged life, a life in which Christ comes in and we go out, for later in this verse Paul said, &ldquo;I live.&rdquo; As regenerated people, we have both the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; which has been crucified (Rom. 6:6), concerning which Paul said, &ldquo;No longer I,&rdquo; and a new &ldquo;I,&rdquo; concerning which Paul said, &ldquo;I live.&rdquo; The old, terminated &ldquo;I&rdquo; was without divinity; the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; has God as life added to it. The new &ldquo;I&rdquo; came into being when the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; was resurrected and God was added to it. On the one hand, Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who was regenerated with God as his life, still lived. Furthermore, although Paul said, &ldquo;No longer I,&rdquo; he also said, &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me,&rdquo; for it was Christ who lived, but it was in Paul that He lived. The two, Christ and Paul, had one life and one living.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the natural person, inclines to keep the law that it might be perfect (Phil. 3:6), but God wants us to live Christ that God might be expressed in us through Him (1:20-21). Hence, God&rsquo;s economy is that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified in Christ&rsquo;s death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection. To keep the law is to exalt it above all things in our life; to live Christ is to make Him the center and everything in our life. The law was used by God for a period of time to keep His chosen people in custody for Christ (Gal. 3:23) and eventually to conduct them to Christ (v. 24) that they might receive Him as life and live Him to be God&rsquo;s expression. Because Christ has come, the function of the law has been terminated, and Christ must replace the law in our lives for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>In 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; According to the concept of an exchanged life, our life is terminated and Christ lives. But we need a more thorough understanding of what it means to say that Christ lives <em>in us.</em> It is rather easy to understand that Christ lives, but it is difficult to understand how Christ lives in us. This does not mean that I have been crucified and live no longer and that Christ lives instead of me. On the one hand, Paul says, &ldquo;No longer I&rdquo;; on the other hand, he says, &ldquo;Christ...lives in me.&rdquo; The phrase <em>in me</em> is of great importance. Yes, it is Christ who lives, but it is in us that He lives.</p>
<p>In order to understand how Christ can live in us, we need to turn to John 14. Before His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live&rdquo; (v. 19). Christ lives in us by causing us to live with Him. Christ does not live alone. He lives in us and with us. He lives by enabling us to live with Him. In a very real sense, if we do not live with Him, He cannot live in us. We have not been altogether ruled out, and our life has not been exchanged for the divine life. We continue to exist, but we exist with the Triune God. The Triune God who now dwells within us causes us to live with Christ. Hence, Christ lives in us through our living with Him.</p>
<p>Once again the illustration of grafting helps our understanding. After a branch has been grafted into a productive tree, the branch continues to live. However, it lives not by itself but by the tree into which it has been grafted. Furthermore, the tree lives in the branch which has been grafted into it. The branch now lives a grafted life. This means that it lives not by itself but by the life of the tree into which it has been grafted. Furthermore, this other life, the life of the productive tree, does not live by itself but through the branch grafted into it. The life of the tree lives in the branch. Eventually, the branch and the tree have one life with one living. In the same principle, we and Christ also have one life and one living.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not an exchanged life, a life in which a lower life is exchanged for a higher one but a life in union with Christ, a grafted life, a life in which the human life is grafted into the life of Christ. On the one hand, we the Gentiles, who were the wild olive branches, have been cut off from a wild olive tree; on the other hand, we have been grafted into a cultivated olive tree (Rom. 11:17, 20, 24). Through crucifixion we have been cut off from Adam, and in resurrection we have been grafted into Christ. We have become the branches of Christ who is the true vine (John 15:1). We and Christ share the same life and the same living. On the one hand, we are terminated; on the other hand, we continue to exist, but we do not live without Him. Christ lives within us, and we live with Him. Therefore, we and He have one life and one living. This corresponds with Romans 6. On the one hand, verse 6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ; on the other hand, verse 11 says that in Christ we are dead to sin but alive to God. This indicates that we do not have an exchanged life, a life in which we are altogether ruled out, but a grafted life, a life in which we are joined to Christ.</p>
<p>If we see this, we will also see that just as the Son lived because of the Father, we should now live because of Christ, taking Him as our person. In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; The Father and the Son are two persons, yet they had but one life and one living. The Father was the life of the Son, and the Son was the living of the Father. Life refers to the inner substance, and living refers to the outward expression. The Father was the living substance within the Son, and the Son was the living expression of the Father. The Son did not live by Himself. However, this does not mean that the Son was set aside and ceased to exist. The Son, of course, continued to exist, but He did not live His own life. Instead, He lived the life of the Father; He lived by the Father and lived the Father. The Son lived because the Father was living within Him (5:19, 30; 14:10). In so doing, the Son expressed the Father, and the Father&rsquo;s life was revealed in the Son&rsquo;s living. In this way, the Son and the Father had one life and one living. They shared the same life and had the same living.</p>
<p>All Christians need to realize that we have another person&mdash;Christ&mdash;living in us. We the believers have Christ&mdash;a great, divine, and all-inclusive person&mdash;living within us. Christ is in us not only as our life; He as a person lives in us. We need to see the vision that the very One who died on the cross to redeem us is now living within us.</p>
<p>Christ, on the one hand, is in the third heaven, but on the other hand, He lives within us. Christ became the life-giving Spirit in order that He might live in us. Without being the life-giving Spirit, it would not be possible for the heavenly Christ to live in us. According to the New Testament revelation, Christ is both the ascended Lord and the life-giving Spirit. As the ascended Lord, He is sitting in the heavens at the right hand of God, and as the life-giving Spirit, He lives within us. Now we have Christ not only as our life but also as our person. Because He lives in us, we should take Him as our person and live Him.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in Galatians 2:20 about Christ living in us is definite and emphatic. Paul clearly says that Christ, as a person, lives in us. This Christ who lives in us is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit. Now that He dwells in us as the Spirit, we need to learn how to let Him live in us and how to live together with Him. A normal believer is a person who has one life and one living with Christ. We are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17), we have one life with Him, and now we should be one person with Him. Sooner or later, those who seek the Lord realize that Someone divine, heavenly, eternal, and spiritual lives in them as a person.</p>
<p>We live Christ because He lives in us (Col. 3:4a; John 14:19-20). Christ lives in us to be our life; we live Christ to be His living. Now it is not we who live but Christ who lives in us through His resurrection. Christ lives in resurrection, and He lives within us. Christ sits on the throne as the Lord, but He lives in us as the Spirit. In John 14:19 the Lord Jesus said that because He lives, that is, in resurrection, we also shall live in Him. We all need to be deeply impressed that Christ lives in us and that we live in Him. Our need is simply to pray &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. Thank You, Lord, that You are one with me. You live in me, and I live in You. Lord Jesus, I desire to live You all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What God desires is to gain a group of people who live by Christ that they may be the corporate expression of Christ. Day by day we need to take Him as our life within so that we may be His living without for His corporate expression. This kind of life should not be occasional or accidental; it must be our habitual daily living from morning to evening. In the matters of our daily life it is very easy for us to live completely by ourselves and not by the Lord. We need to continually exercise to live not by ourselves but by Christ. In every action, word, and thought we should practice living by Him and living because of Him.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Through Their Faith in Him</h2>
<p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul declares, &ldquo;I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>the Son of God</em> denotes Christ&rsquo;s person, which is for the impartation of God&rsquo;s life into us. Hence, the faith in which we live God&rsquo;s life is in the Son of God, the life-imparting One. The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself up for us that He might impart the divine life into us. The life which we now live in the flesh is not <em>bios,</em> the physical life, or <em>psuche,</em> the soulish life, but <em>zoe,</em> the spiritual and divine life. In contrast to the way we live the physical and soulish life, we live the divine life not by sight or by feeling. The divine life, the spiritual life in our spirit, is lived by the exercise of faith, which is stimulated by the presence of the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>One secret of experiencing Christ living in us is revealed in a phrase in Galatians 2:20&mdash;<em>in faith.</em> Paul did not live by his own faith; he lived by the faith that is both in and of the Son of God. This indicates that we need to live by a certain kind of faith. However, this faith is not something that we ourselves have. Rather, it is the faith of the Son of God. What we need is not only faith that is in Christ but also faith that is of Christ. The faith is His, not ours, but we can be in this faith.</p>
<p>In speaking of faith, Paul refers to &ldquo;the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; This expression implies that the faith mentioned in this verse is the faith of the Son of God, the faith which He Himself possesses. However, this phrase also means faith <em>in</em> the Son of God.</p>
<p>Paul wrote the book of Galatians both according to truth and according to his experience. According to our Christian experience, the genuine living faith which operates in us is not only <em>of</em> Christ but also <em>in</em> Christ. Hence, Paul&rsquo;s meaning here actually is &ldquo;the faith of and in Christ.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s thought is that the faith is both of Christ and in Christ.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that faith is our appreciation of what the Lord is and what He has done for us and that genuine faith is Christ Himself infused into us to become our ability to believe in Him. After the Lord has been infused into us, He spontaneously becomes our faith. On the one hand, this faith is <em>of</em> Christ; on the other hand, it is <em>in</em> Christ. This faith is Christ revealed to us and infused into us. Faith is related not only to the Christ who has been infused into us but also to the Christ who is continually infusing Himself into us. As Christ operates in us, He becomes our faith. This faith is of Him and also in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. He Having Loved the Believers<br />
and Given Himself Up for Them</h2>
<p>Paul concludes Galatians 2:20 by referring to the Son of God as the One &ldquo;who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&rdquo; In writing these words, Paul was filled with appreciation of the Lord Jesus. Otherwise, at the end of such a long verse there would have been no need for him to speak of Christ loving him and giving Himself up for him. He could have concluded with the expression <em>the faith of the Son of God.</em> But as he was speaking of the way he now lived, his heart was filled with gratitude and appreciation. Faith comes from such an appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:14 and 15 Paul says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo; As we consider these verses, we can see that Paul&rsquo;s faith came from an appreciation of the constraining love of Christ. The more we appreciate Christ&rsquo;s constraining love, the more faith we will have. This faith is not produced by our own ability or activity. Rather, it is produced by the working in us of the Christ whom we appreciate. In our appreciation for the Lord Jesus, we will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You and I treasure You.&rdquo; As we speak such words to the Lord, He operates within us and becomes our faith. This faith brings about an organic union in which we and Christ are truly one. This organic union is a basic and crucial aspect of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the very One who loved Paul and gave Himself up for him now lived in him, the love of Christ constrained Paul to live no longer to himself but to Christ. The love of Christ constrained Paul to love Him and to take Him as his life and his person. Likewise, since Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us that He might impart Himself as the divine life into us, we should now love Him and live by Him.</p>
<p>Experiencing Christ as the One who has given Himself up for the believers and who lives in them is not a matter of mere doctrine; it is altogether a matter of life and love. We love Christ and simply desire to live a life that is Christ Himself. As a result, we cannot but give up religion and instead enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>In summary, God&rsquo;s economy is not that we try to keep the law in the strength of our flesh; His economy is to work Himself into us. The Triune God has become the processed God. Through incarnation, Christ came in the flesh to fulfill the law and then to set it aside. Through His resurrection, Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, ready to enter into us. Whenever we call on His name out of our appreciation of Him, He comes into us and becomes the living faith which operates in us and brings us into an organic union with Him. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into us to become our life and our being. If we see this, we will be able to proclaim that we have been crucified with Christ and that we live no longer. Nevertheless, Christ lives in us, and we live by the faith that is in Him and of Him. Our old person, the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; has been crucified, but the new person, the new &ldquo;I,&rdquo; still lives. Now we live by faith in the Son of God and of the Son of God, a faith that produces an organic union in which we and Christ are one. There is no comparison between keeping the law and such an organic union. In His economy God&rsquo;s intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new &ldquo;I.&rdquo; The old person, the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; without God, is over, but the new person, the new &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; with the Triune God in it, still lives. We live with Christ and by Christ. Furthermore, we live by faith, which is the means to bring us into oneness with Him. In this organic union we are one with the Lord, for we have one life and one living with Him. When we live, He lives. He lives in us, and we live with Him. We live by Him, and He lives in us. If we do not live, He does not live, and if He does not live, we cannot live.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">55. The Seed of Abraham</h2>
<p>In Galatians 3:1-22 Christ is unveiled as the seed of Abraham. According to Genesis 22:17-18a the Lord promised Abraham, &ldquo;I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.&rdquo; In this prophecy we have the promise that Abraham&rsquo;s seed would be a great blessing to all mankind, for all nations would be blessed through his seed.</p>
<p>This prophecy was repeated to Isaac in Genesis 26:4 and again to Jacob in Genesis 28:14. These three verses are not three prophecies but one prophecy of Christ as the seed of Abraham. The fulfillment of this prophetic word is not only in Matthew 1:1, which says that Christ is the son of Abraham, but also in Galatians 3:16, which says, &ldquo;To Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one: &lsquo;And to your seed,&rsquo; who is Christ.&rdquo; Christ was born as a descendant of Abraham, born of the chosen race. Therefore, He was the seed of Abraham.</p>
<p>As the seed of Abraham, Christ in His humanity blesses all the nations with the gospel of Christ (vv. 8-12, 16). He has brought God to us and us to God for our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s blessing. He brings blessings to the nations. Whether Jews or Gentiles, all will be blessed in Him (Gen. 22:18a). As we will see in this message, Galatians 3:14 indicates that the blessing is the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. When we receive the Spirit, we receive the Triune God as eternal life to be our blessing. Through faith in Christ, we have received the Spirit. The Spirit is also called the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29). When the blessing that God gave to Abraham comes to us, it is grace; this grace is the seed of Abraham. Since Christ is now the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He is not only the seed who inherits the promises but also the blessing of the promises to be inherited by us.</p>
<p>According to Galatians 3:16, Christ is the seed of Abraham, the Heir who inherits the promises. Here Christ is the unique seed who inherits the promises. Hence, in order to inherit the promised blessing, we must be one with Christ. Outside of Him we cannot inherit the promises given by God to Abraham. In God&rsquo;s eyes Abraham has only one seed, Christ. We must be in Him that we may participate in the promises given to Abraham.</p>
<p>According to Galatians 3:14, the promise given to Abraham was that God Himself would come to be the seed of Abraham, and this seed would be a blessing to all the nations by becoming the all-inclusive Spirit for mankind to receive (1 Cor. 15:45b). God&rsquo;s blessing of Abraham eventually issued in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth are blessed (Acts 3:25-26; Gal. 3:16). All the believers in Christ, as members of the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12), are included in this seed as the heirs of God&rsquo;s promised blessing (Gal. 3:7, 29).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Being Crucified and<br />
Becoming a Curse on Our Behalf<br />
to Redeem Us out of the Curse of the Law</h2>
<p>As the seed of Abraham, Christ in His humanity was crucified and became a curse on our behalf to redeem us out of the curse of the law. Galatians 3:1 mentions that Jesus Christ was crucified. Verse 13 goes on to say, &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, &lsquo;Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree.&rsquo;&rdquo; Christ as our Substitute on the cross not only bore the curse for us but also became a curse for us. The curse of the law issued from the sin of man (Gen. 3:17). When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse of the law.</p>
<p>Through his fall, Adam brought us all under the curse; as fallen descendants of Adam, we the sinners were under the curse. The origin of the curse is man&rsquo;s sin. God brought in the curse after Adam&rsquo;s sin, saying, &ldquo;Cursed is the ground because of you&rdquo; (v. 17). The sign of the curse is thorns (v. 18). For this reason, after Adam&rsquo;s sin, the earth brought forth thorns.</p>
<p>However, the curse was not altogether official until the law was given. The law now declares that all the fallen descendants of Adam are under the curse. In other words, the curse is carried out through the law. This means that the law administers the curse. Therefore, the curse is related to the law of God; it is the demand of the righteous God upon sinners.</p>
<p>Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law. On the cross He was even made a curse for us. Therefore, the curse that came in through Adam&rsquo;s fall has been dealt with by Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>When Christ bore our sins, He also took our curse. The crown of thorns indicates this (John 19:2, 5). Since thorns are a sign of the curse, Christ&rsquo;s wearing a crown of thorns indicates that He took our curse on the cross. Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law.</p>
<p>Not only did Christ redeem us out from the curse; He even became a curse on our behalf. This indicates that He was absolutely abandoned by God. God forsook Christ economically and also considered Him a curse. On the cross Christ accomplished the great work of bringing us out from the curse of the law, working to bear our sins and to remove the curse.</p>
<p>In His creation of man, God intended that man might enjoy God as his blessing. But through the fall of Adam, man lost God as his blessing and enjoyment. Not only so, since man did not know that he was totally fallen, incurable, and hopeless, he tried to please God by his own effort. This forced God to decree the law in order to expose man&rsquo;s fallen condition. Knowing that man could not keep the law, God gave man the law, not for him to keep it but for man to realize that he is utterly fallen and hopeless.</p>
<p>Here we need to see that before decreeing the law, God promised Abraham a blessing: Out of him would come a seed who would be a blessing not only to his own house, his race, but also to all the nations, all the Gentiles. With Adam we have sin and the curse, but with Abraham we have God&rsquo;s promise. The background of this promise was the curse upon mankind. Because mankind was under a curse, man&rsquo;s direction was downward. But God came in, called Abraham, and promised that in his seed, all the nations&mdash;mankind under a curse&mdash;would be blessed.</p>
<p>Yet the children of Israel did not realize that God&rsquo;s intention was not for them to try to keep the law but to bring them back to the promise given to their forefather, Abraham, through the law. Because the children of Israel did not see that the function of the law was to expose their fallen condition and to restore them to the promised blessing, they tried to keep the law, thereby coming under the curse of the law (Deut. 27:15-26). The children of Israel, being fallen in nature, surely did not measure up to the law; thus, they were cursed under the law.</p>
<p>Through His incarnation Christ came as the seed of Abraham, and through His crucifixion Christ died on the cross to be a curse on our behalf. In doing so, Christ removed the curse from all those who believe in Him. Through His work on the cross, Christ became a curse on our behalf and redeemed us out of the curse of the law so that the blessing God promised to Abraham would be bestowed on all those who believe in Christ.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:10 Paul says, &ldquo;As many as are of the works of law are under a curse; for it is written, &lsquo;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them.&rsquo;&rdquo; If we try to keep the law, we will be in the flesh and automatically come under the curse, for those who are of the works of the law are under the curse. Instead of trying to keep the law, we should thank the law for exposing us and then bid it farewell. We should leave the law and go to Christ and to the cross.</p><h2 class="head4">b. That We Might Receive the Spirit<br />
as the Blessing of the Gospel Promised to Abraham,<br />
the Promise That All the Nations<br />
Will Be Blessed in Him</h2>
<p>Christ as the seed of Abraham was crucified and became a curse on our behalf to redeem us out of the curse of the law in order that we might receive the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel promised to Abraham, the promise that all the nations would be blessed in Him. Galatians 3:14 says, &ldquo;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; This verse combines the promise of the Spirit with the blessing of Abraham. The blessing of Abraham is the blessing promised by God to Abraham (Gen. 12:3) for all the nations of the earth. This promise was fulfilled and this blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross. The context of Galatians 3:14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit, who is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension for us to receive as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God. The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 1:12). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&rsquo;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:14 the blessing of the promise is the Spirit, and in verse 16 the promises were made to Abraham&rsquo;s seed, who is Christ. On the one hand, the Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ. On the other hand, the Spirit, as the blessing of the promise, was given to Christ as the seed. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him as seed, as life. This seed is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the reality of the good land. The Christ whom we received as the seed is the Spirit typified by the good land. Christ came into us as the seed, but as we live by Him, He becomes the land (the all-inclusive Spirit), which is our portion. This is the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s word to Abraham that through his seed the blessing of the gospel would come to all the families of the earth.</p>
<p>Our blessing is God Himself, who is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment. In the universe only God Himself is a blessing; all else is vanity of vanities (Eccl. 1:2). Even the entire universe cannot compare with our Triune God. If we have God, we have the blessing. However, God becoming our blessing involved a process. Just as food must be cooked to become our blessing, God had to be &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; in order to be our blessing. Before passing through a process, God was a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God. By passing through a process, God became the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; God to be our life and life supply. This God in His totality is the processed, consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit. He as the wonderful Spirit is the blessing from God to us. The blessing of the gospel is the Spirit, the sum total and the aggregate of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Our spiritual blessing for eternity is to inherit the Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as our inheritance. In the new heaven and new earth in the New Jerusalem, we will enjoy the processed Triune God, who is the all-inclusive, consummated, life-giving Spirit (Rev. 22:1; John 7:37-39). Even today, the most enjoyable thing to us is the indwelling Spirit.</p>
<p>In the full gospel of God, in Christ we have received not only the blessing of forgiveness, washing, and cleansing; even more, we have received the greatest blessing, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;as the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in us in a most subjective way for our enjoyment. Oh, what a blessing that we can enjoy such an all-inclusive One as our daily portion!</p>
<p>The blessing of the gospel promised to Abraham is the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit compounded with Christ&rsquo;s divinity, His humanity, His human living, His all-inclusive death with its effectiveness, His powerful resurrection with its life power, and His ascension. This compound Spirit is the Spirit spoken of in John 7:39, the Spirit which was not yet until Jesus was glorified. In this verse the Lord told the disciples that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. The Holy Spirit was there, but the all-inclusive, compound Spirit was not yet, because by that time, when Jesus spoke those words, He had not yet been glorified; that is, He had not yet been crucified and resurrected (Luke 24:26). It was through His crucifixion and resurrection that Christ became a life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive compound Spirit is typified by the holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices in Exodus 30. A hin of olive oil was compounded with four spices to produce the holy anointing oil, the holy ointment. The four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia&mdash;were compounded with the oil to become a compound ointment. In typology oil signifies the Spirit of God, and the compound ointment, the oil blended with four spices, signifies the compound Spirit. Through a compounding process the oil became an ointment. Before Exodus 30 this compound was &ldquo;not yet,&rdquo; but after Exodus 30 such an ointment was definitely in existence. In like manner, before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was not yet (John 7:39). But through the process of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection the Spirit of God, typified by the oil, became the compound Spirit, typified by the ointment.</p>
<p>The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows. Flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (John 19:39), signifies the precious death of Christ (Rom. 6:3). Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death (8:13). Fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3). Cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10). Moreover, since the number four signifies the creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26), and the number one signifies the unique God (Deut. 4:35; 1 Tim. 2:5), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God&rsquo;s creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. Lev. 2:4). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being the three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being &ldquo;split&rdquo; by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (Matt. 25:2), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capacity, for bearing responsibility. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit. Before Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God did not have these elements. But after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection these elements were compounded into the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God became the Spirit, the compound Spirit symbolized by the compound ointment.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God given to us as the blessing of the gospel. When presenting the real blessing of the gospel, Paul does not list many items such as peace, joy, and forgiveness of sins; rather, Paul speaks only of one person&mdash;the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. The Bible reveals that our God is triune (Matt. 28:19). The Father planned, and Christ the Son created the universe through the Spirit (Eph. 1:9; Gen. 1:1-3; John 1:3; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2, 10; Psa. 102:25-27). One day God came in incarnation to be a man named Jesus; He became a God-man, God living in a man. He was the Son with the Father by the Spirit (John 8:29; Matt. 12:28); the entire Trinity was embodied in Him (Col. 2:9). After approximately thirty-three and a half years of human living, He went to the cross. When He died on the cross, He was dying as the Son with the Father by the Spirit. On the cross He was dying not merely as the Son of God in the human flesh; rather, the entire Triune God was involved in His crucifixion (Heb. 9:14). For this reason, Acts 20:28 tells us that God obtained the church with His own blood, that is, with the blood of His Son, Jesus Christ (1 John 1:7). Although many Christian teachers dare not say that God died on the cross, Charles Wesley recognized this and said in one of his hymns, &ldquo;Amazing love! how can it be / That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #296). After His death on the cross, He was buried. Then on the third day He came out of Hades and the tomb and was resurrected. On the one hand, as a man, He was raised by God from the dead (Rom. 8:11; Acts 2:24, 32; 10:40); on the other hand, as God Himself, He rose from the dead (10:41; 1 Thes. 4:14). According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, in His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6). That Christ is the life-giving Spirit is confirmed by 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The Triune God&mdash;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit&mdash;has passed through processes to be consummated in the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God having gone through many processes in Christ. This life-giving Spirit is the blessing of the gospel. The blessing of the gospel is the processed Triune God reaching us as the Spirit. In this compound, all-inclusive Spirit are all of Christ&rsquo;s person and process, including His divinity, humanity, crucifixion for Him to accomplish redemption, resurrection for Him to give life to us, and ascension for Him to be the Lord of all (Rom. 8:11; 2 Cor. 3:18). If we have the Spirit, we have everything and we are short of nothing. The Spirit is everything to us to live the Christian life. The Christian life is altogether the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have God, man, redemption, and forgiveness of sins. The Spirit is our God, our Father, our Lord, our Redeemer, our Savior, and our Shepherd; the Spirit is our life, our life supply, our righteousness, our sanctification, our transformation, and our redemption. The all-inclusive Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God given to us as the blessing. We should praise the Lord that we have received the Spirit as such a blessing and may enjoy Him all the time through eternity.</p>
<p>Galatians reveals the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God: by God&rsquo;s revealing of Christ in us (1:16a; Eph. 1:17; Gen. 13:14-18; Eph. 3:8, 19); by our receiving of Christ out of the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2); by being born according to the Spirit and by being given the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son into our hearts (4:29b, 6); by putting on Christ through the baptism that puts us into Christ (3:27); by being identified with Him in His death so that it may be no longer we who live but He who lives in us (2:20); by living and walking by the Spirit (5:16, 25); by having Christ formed in us through travail (4:19); by sowing unto the Spirit with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires (6:7-8); by boasting in the cross of Christ and living a new creation (vv. 14-15); and by enjoying the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirit (vv. 17-18).</p>
<p>In summary, through Adam&rsquo;s fall the human race was brought under the curse, but God promised Abraham that in his seed the nations, which had been brought under the curse, would be blessed. Christ has fulfilled God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham. If Christ had not come as the seed of Abraham, there would have been no way for God to fulfill His promise to Abraham. Moreover, Christ as the seed of Abraham has redeemed us out of the curse of the law so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Him. Christ died a substitutionary death on the cross to deliver us from the curse brought in by Adam. Then in resurrection Christ, who was the unique seed of Abraham as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of Abraham, the seed of Abraham, dispensed into us to make us the sons of Abraham, the corporate seed of Abraham, those who can receive and inherit the consummated Spirit as the blessing of Abraham (3:7, 14; 4:28). The blessing promised to Abraham comes to us through Christ&rsquo;s redemption; now in Christ all the nations will be blessed. The curse has been taken away, and the blessing has come. Before we believed into Christ and were saved, we were cursed under the law. Having believed into Christ, we are no longer cursed; we are blessed through Christ in His humanity as the seed of Abraham, and we are blessed with the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God (3:13-14). As the seed of Abraham, Christ brought to us the processed and consummated Triune God as our blessing for our enjoyment. The all-inclusive Spirit, who the all-inclusive Christ as the seed of Abraham has become, is the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ for the divine dispensing according to the divine economy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">56. The Goal of the Law</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:24-29 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the goal of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.The Law as the Child-conductor,<br />
Conducting God&rsquo;s Chosen People to Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in giving His people the law was not for them to keep it; rather, He intended that the law would conduct God&rsquo;s chosen people to Christ. Paul says in verses 24 and 25, &ldquo;So then the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ that we might be justified out of faith. But since faith has come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&rdquo; Here <em>child-conductor</em> means &ldquo;an escort, guardian, or custodian, one who cares for a child who is under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster.&rdquo; In ancient times the children of wealthy Jewish families were escorted to their schoolmaster by a custodian, a child-conductor. Likewise, the law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and bring them to Christ when He did come, that they might be justified by faith and participate in the blessing promised and covenanted by God. Before we were brought to Christ, the schoolmaster, we were under the care of a custodian, the law. The law was responsible for the care and protection of God&rsquo;s chosen people, and eventually it brought them to Christ. Once we have been brought to Christ, we are justified by faith. Since faith has come, that is, since Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding law any longer (v. 25).</p>
<p>The law is a custodian that keeps sinners by condemning them. Apart from the law&rsquo;s condemnation, it could not function as a custodian. Without the law&rsquo;s exposure and condemnation, we cannot realize how many sins we have committed against God. Without the law, we would be without regulation or restriction. But because the law condemns us, we are kept by the law. If there had been no law to condemn the people, there would have been no need of redemption. We need redemption because we are under the condemnation of the law. By exposing and condemning us, the law keeps us for Christ and brings us to Christ.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament an Israelite who had sinned was condemned by the law and was required to present a trespass offering in order to be forgiven. The law functioned as a custodian to bring the sinning Israelite to Christ, his Redeemer, typified by the trespass offering. If it had not been for the law, not many of the children of Israel would have come to the altar with a trespass offering. Because the law exposed them and condemned them, they realized their need to come to the altar with the required offering. When they came to the altar with a trespass offering, they were justified by faith in that offering. Because of the trespass offering, God forgave them of their sin.</p>
<p>The children of Israel were justified not by works of law but by their faith in the trespass offering. In typology, this is to be justified by faith. The principle in the New Testament is the same. The law still condemns all those who have sinned. Those condemned under the law should come to Christ and exercise faith in Him as their trespass offering. In this way sinners are justified by faith. This indicates that the law first exposes our sin and condemns us and then brings us to Christ (Rom. 3:19-20). On the one hand, we should not return to the law. On the other hand, we should not despise the law, for it has a positive position, that of a custodian to keep us in custody for Christ and that of a child-conductor to bring us to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Through Our Faith in Christ and<br />
Our Being Baptized into Christ to Be Abraham&rsquo;s Seed, Heirs of God according to Promise</h2>
<p>Through our faith in Christ, that is, by believing in Him, and through our being baptized into Christ, that is, by being put into Him, we have become Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs of God according to promise.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:7 Paul says, &ldquo;They who are of faith, these are sons of Abraham.&rdquo; In verse 26 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>sons of God</em> refers to sons of full age, who have outgrown the custody of the slave guardian. Under the old testament, God&rsquo;s chosen people were considered infants. Now under the new testament, they are considered sons of full age, who will inherit the promised blessing&mdash;the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ. Faith in Christ brings us into Christ, making us one with Christ, in whom is the sonship. We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may be sons of Abraham and sons of God. Christ is both the Son of God and the son of Abraham. On the one hand, because we are now in Christ, the Son of God, we are sons of God; on the other hand, because we are now in Christ, the son of Abraham, we are the sons of Abraham.</p>
<p>It is a matter of tremendous significance for the divine life to be imparted into us. The impartation of the divine life into us causes an organic union, which makes us both the sons of God and the sons of Abraham. This organic union takes place exclusively in Christ. In Christ we enjoy the wonderful organic union with the Triune God. In this union we are, on the one hand, the sons of God and, on the other hand, the sons of Abraham. Christ is the unique sphere in which this all takes place. Whenever we enter into this sphere, we become sons of God and sons of Abraham. Our true status is that in Christ and by the organic union with the Triune God, we are both sons of God and sons of Abraham.</p>
<p>We are both sons of God and sons of Abraham because we have been baptized into Christ and have put on Christ. In verse 27 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; To believe is to believe into Christ (John 3:16), and to be baptized is to be baptized into Christ (Rom. 6:3). By both faith and baptism we have entered into Christ, having thus put on Christ and become identified with Christ. Baptism practiced in a proper, genuine, and living way puts the believers into the name of the Triune God, the divine name (Matt. 28:19); into Christ, a living person (Gal. 3:27); into the death of Christ, an effective death (Rom. 6:3); and into the Body of Christ, a living organism (1 Cor. 12:13), that the believers may enter into an organic union not only with Christ but also with His Body.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:28 Paul says, &ldquo;There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that in Christ we are one new man, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:15. Because there is only one seed of Abraham, Christ, we are all baptized into Christ to become one new man in Christ. Hence, the one seed of Abraham is not only Christ alone, but Christ with all those who have been baptized into Him. All those who have believed in Christ and have been baptized into Him are one with Him and are one new man. This corporate man is the unique seed of Abraham, who is qualified to inherit the blessing of the promise.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:29 Paul continues, &ldquo;And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs according to promise.&rdquo; Abraham has only one seed, Christ (v. 16). Hence, to be Abraham&rsquo;s seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God&rsquo;s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God, who is our portion. Under the new testament the believers as God&rsquo;s chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ. Like Ishmael (4:23), the Judaizers, who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ, were Abraham&rsquo;s descendants according to the flesh; they were not like Isaac (v. 28), who was Abraham&rsquo;s heir according to promise. But the believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing. Hence, we should remain in Christ and not turn to the law. After we have believed into Christ, we should have nothing to do with the law; we should only remain in Christ, abiding in Him (John 15:4).</p>
<p>Since the law is unable to give us life (Gal. 3:21), it cannot produce the sons of God, but the Spirit, who is received out of faith (v. 2) and who gives us life (2 Cor. 3:6), can. The law kept God&rsquo;s chosen people under its custody until faith came (Gal. 3:23). Faith in Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, makes God&rsquo;s chosen people Abraham&rsquo;s seed like &ldquo;the stars of the heavens&rdquo; (Gen. 22:17) according to God&rsquo;s promise.</p>
<p>The seed of Abraham is first the individual Christ and then the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12), composed of Christ as the Head and all His believers (Gal. 3:29) as the Body. All the believers in Christ, as the members of the corporate Christ, are included in this seed as the heirs of God&rsquo;s promised blessing. Eventually, the eternal New Jerusalem, the great, corporate Christ, will be the ultimate consummation of the seed of Abraham (Gen. 22:17; Rev. 21:12-14).</p>
<p>As the unique seed of Abraham, Christ includes all the believers who have been baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27-28). In one sense, when Christ died on the cross, He was crucified alone as our Redeemer. But in another sense, we were with Him in His crucifixion. For the accomplishment of redemption, Christ was crucified alone, but for terminating the old creation, Christ included us in His crucifixion. In the same principle, in the fulfillment of the promise made by God to Abraham, we are not included as part of the unique seed. We can have no share in the fulfillment of this promise. However, for inheriting the promise and enjoying it, we are included. Christ alone fulfilled the promise, but Christ and we share in the enjoyment of the promise. Therefore, on the one hand, the seed is uniquely one; on the other hand, it is all-inclusive. For fulfillment, the seed is one; for inheritance and enjoyment, the seed is all-inclusive, including all believers who have been baptized into Christ.</p>
<p>We, the New Testament believers, were born sons of fallen Adam, and in Adam, because of transgressions, we were under the law of Moses. But we have been reborn to become the sons of Abraham and have been freed from the law of Moses by faith in Christ. We are sons of Abraham not by natural birth but by faith. In other words, when we were regenerated, we were spontaneously transferred from the created and fallen race, the Adamic race, to the called race, the Abrahamic race. Formerly we were descendants of Adam; now we are descendants of Abraham. As previously mentioned, Galatians 3:7 and 29 tell us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham. We are the real Jews (Rom. 2:29). If we were not descendants of Abraham, we would have no share in the book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham. Only if we are descendants of Abraham do we have a share in Galatians. We should praise the Lord that we are the sons of Abraham.</p>
<p>We the believers who are sons of Abraham through faith are the heirs of the promise, those who inherit the blessing. As such heirs, we need to be filled, occupied, and saturated with Christ. Moreover, if we are the seed of Abraham, we belong to Christ and we are associated with Christ. If we would be associated with Christ, we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as everything. This is believing in Christ. If we are the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything other than Christ and live by faith, not by our works. We must forget about all that we can do and repudiate all that we are and have by nature. Although we all have a natural life with a natural ancestry, we need not live any longer according to that life. Instead, we may live by the divine life with the divine nature. By living according to this life, we are in reality the sons of Abraham.</p>
<p>We have been baptized into Christ, the unique seed who has fulfilled God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham. We have been joined to Christ in a marvelous organic union. Because of this union, we are sons of Abraham. In this organic union we inherit the promise which has been fulfilled by Christ, who as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is this inheritance. Now if we give up all that we are and have, put our trust in Christ, and live and walk by faith in Christ, then as heirs of God&rsquo;s promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we will participate in Christ as God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>Galatians 3 reveals that God gave the promise to Abraham according to His eternal purpose. Before this promise was fulfilled, the law was given to serve as the custodian of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Then at the appointed time Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill the promise and bring in the promised blessing. This is grace. Hence, grace came with Christ and with the fulfillment of the promise. All this is on God&rsquo;s side. On our side, we need a way to apprehend, realize, and enjoy all that Christ, the seed, is and has accomplished. Therefore, there is grace on God&rsquo;s side, and there is faith on our side. Now since we have grace, faith, and the seed that has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian. Hence, we must set aside the law and turn from the custodian to stay with Christ that we may enjoy the promised blessing by remaining in grace and faith. This blessing is nothing less than the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(35)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">57. The Son of God</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:4-7 Paul presents Christ as the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.Sent Forth by God, Born of a Woman,<br />
and Born under Law</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:4 Paul says, &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law.&rdquo; Here <em>the fullness of the time</em> refers to the completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed by the Father (v. 2). In verse 4 Paul describes the Son of God as &ldquo;born of a woman, born under law.&rdquo; The woman is the virgin Mary (Luke 1:27-35). The Son of God was born of her to be the seed of woman, as promised in Genesis 3:15. Furthermore, Christ was born under law, as revealed in Luke 2:21-24 and 27, and He kept the law, as revealed in the four Gospels.</p>
<p>For the accomplishment of redemption, it was necessary for the Son of God to become a human being born of a woman and born under the law. In order to put on humanity, a human nature, He had to come of a woman. By being born of a woman, Jesus, the Son of God, was a man with blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14). If He had not possessed blood and flesh, there would have been no way for the Son of God to accomplish redemption, which required the shedding of blood.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. That He Might Redeem Those under Law<br />
That We Might Receive the Sonship</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:5 Paul continues, &ldquo;That He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s chosen people were shut up by the law under its custody (3:23). Christ was born under law in order to redeem God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, they were delivered from the law in order that they might receive the sonship. Hence, they should not return to the custody of the law to be under its slavery, as the Galatians were seduced to do; instead, they should remain in the sonship of God to enjoy the life supply of the Spirit in Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemption brings us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life. God&rsquo;s economy is not to make us keepers of the law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God&rsquo;s economy is to make us sons of God, who inherit the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression (Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship (Eph. 1:5) and regenerated us to be His sons (John 1:12-13). We should remain in His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all that He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not appreciate the law and thereby be distracted to Judaism.</p>
<p>Sonship involves life, maturity, position, and privilege. To be a son of God, we need to have the Father&rsquo;s life. However, we must go on to mature in this life (Heb. 6:1). Life and maturity give us the right, the privilege, and the position to inherit the things of the Father. According to the New Testament, sonship includes life, maturity, position, and right.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Because We Have Become Sons,<br />
God Having Sent Forth the Spirit of His Son<br />
into Our Hearts, Crying, Abba, Father!</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) God Having Sent Forth the Spirit of His Son</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Son is the embodiment of the divine life (1 John 5:12). Hence, the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God gives us His Spirit of life not because we are law keepers but because we are His sons. As law keepers, we have no right to enjoy God&rsquo;s Spirit of life; as the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life. Such a Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, is the focus of the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham (Gal. 3:14).</p>
<p>Galatians 4:4-6 speaks of the Triune God&rsquo;s producing of many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive the sonship. He also sent forth God the Spirit, the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality.</p>
<p>Galatians 4:4 and 6 speak of two kinds of sending. Verse 4 says that God sent forth His Son and verse 6, that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son. According to the promise in Genesis 3:15, Christ came under law as the seed of the woman in order to redeem those who were under law that they might receive the sonship. The goal of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, therefore, is sonship. Through His redemption Christ has opened the way for us to possess the sonship. However, if the Spirit had not come, our sonship would have been a sonship in position or form, not a sonship with reality. The reality of sonship, which depends on life and maturity, comes only by the Spirit. Therefore, Galatians 4:6 declares that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts.</p>
<p>We should not think that the Spirit of the Son is a person separate from the Son. The Spirit of the Son is another form of the Son. The One who was crucified was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit (3:1-2). In crucifixion for our redemption, this One was Christ, but in the indwelling to be our life, He is the Spirit. When the Son died on the cross, He was Christ, but when He enters into us, He is the Spirit. First He came as the Son under the law to qualify us for sonship. But after He had finished this work, He became, in resurrection, the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son. Thus, first God the Father sent the Son to accomplish judicial redemption and to qualify us for sonship. Then He sent the Spirit to vitalize the sonship and to make it real in our experience, that is, to bring us into its reality. Today sonship actually depends upon the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son.</p>
<p>Basically, sonship is a matter of life. The position and right of sons depend on the life. Therefore, to receive God&rsquo;s sonship is to receive the dispensing of the divine life. This indicates that in order for us to enjoy God&rsquo;s sonship, we need the Spirit. Apart from the Spirit, we cannot be born of God to have the divine life. Once we have been born of the Spirit, we need the Spirit in order for us to grow in life. Without the Spirit, we cannot have the position, right, or privilege of sonship. All the crucial points regarding sonship depend on the Spirit. The Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son is the reality of sonship. By the Spirit, we have the divine birth and the divine life. Through the Spirit we grow unto maturity. Because of the Spirit we have the position, right, and privilege of sonship. Thus, without the Spirit sonship is a vain, empty term. But when the Spirit comes, the sonship is made real. By the Spirit of sonship we can fully realize God&rsquo;s sonship in life, maturity, position, and right.</p>
<p>For us to be sons of God in a way that is real and practical, we urgently need the Spirit. God sends the Spirit into our inner being through the hearing of the word. Whenever we prayerfully read and assimilate a portion of the Word, we receive the supply of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Spirit of His Son in Our Hearts,<br />
Crying, Abba, Father</h2>
<p>In 4:6 Paul says that God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts. Actually, the Spirit of God came into our spirit at the time of our regeneration (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16). Because our spirit is hidden in our heart (1 Pet. 3:4), and because the word here refers to a matter that is related to our feeling and understanding, both of which belong to our heart, Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son was sent into our hearts.</p>
<p>The parallel verse, Romans 8:15, says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; whereas Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son is crying in our hearts, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one, and that our spirit is in our heart. This indicates also that the sonship of God is realized by us through our subjective experience in the depth of our being. In this verse, Paul appealed to such an experience of the Galatian believers for the supporting of his revelation. This appeal was quite convincing and subduing because it contained not only objective doctrines but also subjective, experiential facts.</p>
<p><em>Abba</em> is an Aramaic word, and <em>Father</em> is the translation of the Greek word <em>Pater.</em> Such a term was used first by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while He was praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father. What a marvelous fact it is that we are sons of God! We have the assurance that we are truly God&rsquo;s sons because in our spirit we can sweetly cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As human beings, we have not only a spirit but also our person, our being. The center of our person is our heart. For us to become sons of God involves not only our spirit but also our heart as the center of our personality. Since the spirit is in the heart (1 Pet. 3:4), it is not possible for the Spirit to be sent into our spirit without also being sent into our heart. It is important for us to realize that our spirit is the kernel, the central part, of our heart. When God&rsquo;s Spirit was sent into our spirit, the Spirit was sent into the kernel of our heart. When the Spirit cries within us, He cries from our spirit and through our heart. Hence, concerning sonship, our heart must be involved.</p>
<p>The inner sense we have as we call on the Lord from our spirit through our heart is mainly in the heart, not in the spirit. This implies that to be genuinely spiritual we need to be emotional in a proper way. We are not senseless statues; we are human beings with feelings. Therefore, the more we cry &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; in the spirit, the deeper the sweet and intimate sense will be in our heart.</p>
<p>The sense we have when calling in this way is sweet and intimate. Although the Spirit of sonship has come into our spirit, the Spirit cries in our hearts, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; This indicates that our relationship with our Father in the sonship is sweet and very intimate. How tender and sweet it is to call God, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo;! Such an intimate calling involves our emotion as well as our spirit. The Spirit of sonship in our spirit cries &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; from our heart. This proves that we have a genuine, bona fide relationship in life with our Father. We are His real sons.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. As Sons, Our Becoming Heirs Also<br />
through the Triune God</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:7 Paul continues, &ldquo;So then you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.&rdquo; The New Testament believer is no longer a slave to works under law but is a son in life under grace. Instead of the law that keeps us in custody, we have the all-inclusive Spirit, who is everything to us. Whereas the law could not give life, the Spirit gives life and brings us into maturity that we may have the full position and right of sons. The custody of the law has been replaced by the Spirit of sonship.</p>
<p> As sons, we also are heirs through God. An heir is one who is of full age according to the law (the Roman law is used for illustration) and who is qualified to inherit the father&rsquo;s estate. The New Testament believers become heirs of God not through the law or through their fleshly father but through God, even the Triune God&mdash;the Father, who sent forth the Son and the Spirit (vv. 4, 6); the Son, who accomplished redemption for sonship (v. 5); and the Spirit, who carries out the sonship within us (v. 6).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">58. The One Who Is Formed in the Believers</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:19 Christ is presented as the One who is formed in the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.Having Been Born in Us and Now Living in Us,<br />
His Being Formed in Us unto Maturity</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo; Paul considered himself the begetting father and the Galatian believers his children begotten of him in Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 4:15; Philem. 10). The word <em>travail</em> refers to painful toil in childbirth. In this metaphor Paul likened himself to a mother who gives birth to a child. He had labored in this way to regenerate the Galatians when he first preached the gospel to them. Because they deviated from the gospel that he had preached to them, he was toiling again in travail until Christ would be formed in them.</p>
<p>When the Galatian believers were regenerated through Paul&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel to them the first time, Christ was born into them but not formed in them. Here the apostle was travailing again that Christ might be formed in them. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us. First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed in Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life (Gal. 2:20), and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity.</p>
<p>According to the context of the book of Galatians, to have Christ formed in us is to allow Him to permeate our being and saturate our inward parts. When Christ occupies our inner being in this way, He is formed in us. In order to have Christ formed in us, we need to drop everything other than Christ Himself, no matter how good these things may be. Even things which come from God and are scriptural may not be Christ Himself. Although the law was given by God, it must be set aside so that all the ground in our being may be given over to Christ. We need to allow Him to saturate every part of our inner being. He must occupy us and saturate our mind, emotion, and will. To have Christ possess our entire being is to have Him formed in us.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:17 Paul prayed that &ldquo;Christ may make His home in your hearts.&rdquo; The heart includes the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. To let Christ make His home in our hearts means to allow Him to make His home in all these parts of our inner being. For Christ to make home in our hearts, He needs to be able to settle down within us. This is to have Christ formed in us.</p>
<p>To have Christ formed in us is to allow the all-inclusive Spirit to occupy every part of our inner being. The law should not have any room in our mind, emotion, or will. All the ground within us must be for Christ. We need to allow Christ to occupy us fully. He should not only spread into our mind, emotion, and will; He should actually become our mind, emotion, and will. We should let Christ be our thought, our decision, our love, and everything to us. This is to have Christ formed in us. Everything other than Christ must diminish, and Christ must become everything to us in our experience.</p>
<p>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ mingled with our whole being. In every part of our being&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, conscience, and spirit&mdash;Christ should be mingled with us. Christ must saturate us and permeate us until He is completely blended with us; then He will be formed in us. This indicates that He desires to have a very subjective relationship with us.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word about Christ being formed in the believers implies that we are being constituted with Christ. Christ is living in us, He is being formed in us, and He is becoming our constitution. To have Christ formed in us is a living, organic matter. Christ is now living in us so that we may be constituted with Him organically. He intends to constitute our whole being&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;with Himself. Eventually, our whole being will be constituted with the element of Christ. This means that He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His image, in every part of our being.</p>
<p>For Christ to be formed in us means that His element is being constituted into us. In other words, His being is becoming our being, and His constitution is becoming our constitution. This is a matter not merely of the element of Christ being within us but of having the element of Christ constituted into us. To be constituted with Christ in this way involves a process of organic transformation and formation. In this process something living&mdash;Christ with His element&mdash;is being constituted into, wrought into, our being. The New Testament reveals that Christ is deeply related to our being. This is not merely a concept, theory, or theology; it is a divine fact that we need to experience in full.</p>
<p>The word <em>formed</em> in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word <em>image</em> in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into Christ&rsquo;s image. This image is a form. Christ must be formed in us so that we may express Him by being in His image. As the living One, Christ with His element is working within us organically, constituting our being with Himself so that we may have His form and express His image.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Paul used the words <em>transformed</em> (2 Cor. 3:18) and <em>conformed</em> (Rom. 8:29). Christ&rsquo;s being formed in us depends on our being transformed into His image. If we are not transformed into His image, Christ has not been formed in us. Moreover, our being transformed into His image and His being formed in us cause us to be conformed to His image. Our being conformed to His image is the issue of His being formed in us.</p>
<p>Romans 12:2a says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; This verse tells us that we should not be conformed to the age but be transformed by the renewing of our mind. Our mind is the leading part of our soul, and as it is renewed, our will and emotion are automatically renewed. To have Christ formed in us is to have the three parts of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;renewed. To have our mind, emotion, and will renewed is to have Christ saturate our mind, emotion, and will. To be renewed is to replace the self and the world in our mind, emotion, and will with Christ. If we are renewed in this way, Christ will be formed in us, and every part of our inner being&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;will bear the image of Christ.</p>
<p>However, most of us do not yet bear the image of Christ in our mind, emotion, and will. At times we may think noble thoughts, but frequently in our daily life our mind may express the self with the world. We may love, laugh, and weep by the self, rather than by Christ; this indicates that Christ has not been formed in our emotion. Many times when Christians speak, their speaking is full of the self and the element of the world. The reason for this is that the self and the world are formed and expressed in them. We can never be an expression of Christ until He saturates our entire inner being, replacing the self and the world in our soul with Himself. Then our inner being will bear the form, the image, of Christ.</p>
<p>According to Paul&rsquo;s usage in the New Testament, the word <em>form</em> refers to the outward expression of the inner being (Phil. 2:6). What we are is expressed in our form, that is, the outward expression of our inner being. If we are full of the self and love the world in our inner being, our outward form will be the self and the world. The choices we make in our daily living will express the self and the world. If Christ replaces the self and the world in our mind, emotion, and will, we will have the form of Christ. The Galatians were occupied by Judaism; thus, in their outward form they expressed Judaism. Therefore, Paul had to suffer like a mother, travailing for the Galatians until Christ would replace the self and the world in them with Himself.</p>
<p>For Christ to be formed in us, we need to let Him occupy every part of our soul: our mind, emotion, and will. He should occupy our thinking, our consideration, our love, our hatred, our happiness, our sorrow, and our intention. As Christ increasingly saturates our soul, eventually He will invade our body, dispensing Himself into our entire being. We then will be fully permeated with Him; He will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to His image.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. That We May Be Sons of Full Age and<br />
Heirs of God&rsquo;s Promised Blessing,<br />
and Mature in the Divine Sonship</h2>
<p>Christ needs to be formed in us in order that we may be sons of full age and heirs to inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing and that we may mature in the divine sonship. He matures in us for us to be heirs (Gal. 3:29) for the full enjoyment of the Triune God as our inheritance (Eph. 1:14; 1 Pet. 1:4). The Holy Spirit is the pledge of this inheritance (Eph. 1:13b-14a).</p>
<p>The book of Galatians reveals that God&rsquo;s intention is for Christ to be wrought into His chosen people that they may become sons of God. In order to be God&rsquo;s sons, we need to be permeated and saturated with Christ. Christ must occupy our entire being. The Galatians, however, were distracted from Christ to the law. Hence, Paul told them repeatedly that it was altogether wrong to leave Christ and return to the law. The believers should come back to Christ, who is both the seed who fulfills God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham and the good land, the all-inclusive Spirit, to be our enjoyment. As believers in Christ, we need the full enjoyment of this blessing, the full enjoyment of the life-giving Spirit. We need to be saturated, possessed, and fully taken over by this Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ has been born in us; that is, He has been revealed in us. He is now living in us, and He will be formed in us unto maturity. We must stress this marvelous truth in the ministry of the word and must experience it in our daily living. May the Lord bring us into the experience and enjoyment of Christ who has been born in us, is now living in us, and will be formed in us unto maturity in order that we may be sons of full age, heirs of God&rsquo;s promised blessing, and may mature in the divine sonship.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">59. The Emancipator</h2>
<p>In Galatians 5 Christ is presented as the Emancipator.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Setting Us Free from the Slavery of the Law</h2>
<p>In Galatians 5:1 Paul says, &ldquo;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.&rdquo; The word <em>freedom</em> in this verse denotes freedom from the slavery of the law. Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom in grace. Thus, we should stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of the law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered <em>entangled</em> in verse 1 may also be translated as being held in a snare. To deviate from Christ to the law is to be entangled or held in a snare. The yoke of slavery is the bondage of the law, which makes the law keepers slaves under a binding yoke. Here Paul is telling the Galatians that they must set aside the yoke of slavery and return to their freedom in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Bringing Us into Grace by the Spirit<br />
and out of Faith Operating through Love</h2>
<p>As the Emancipator who delivers us from the slavery of the law, Christ brings us into grace by the Spirit and by faith operating through love.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Bringing Us into Grace</h2>
<p>In 5:4 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.&rdquo; Here to be brought to nought is to be reduced to nothing, separated from Christ; deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him (Darby&rsquo;s New Translation), making Him of no effect. To go back to the law is to be severed from Christ, to be brought to nought, separated from Christ. To be brought to nought, separated from Christ, is to fall from grace. This implies that the grace in which we believers are is just Christ Himself. Therefore, to fall away from the grace of God is to fall away from Christ. We should not fall away from grace. Rather, we should have grace (Heb. 12:28), be confirmed by grace (13:9), and stand in grace (Rom. 5:2).</p>
<p>Grace is Christ Himself, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment. To go back to the law is to reject this grace, to fall from grace. In Galatians 5:4 Paul indicates that although by believing into Christ and being baptized into Christ the Galatians were grafted into Him as the rich tree and were enjoying His unsearchable riches, by going back to the law and to circumcision they were brought to nought, annihilated, from the unsearchably rich Christ. If we go to anything other than Christ&mdash;such as the law or character improvement&mdash;and if we do not cleave to Christ that we may enjoy Him continually, then our enjoyment of Christ will be confiscated. Conversely, when we are in intimate fellowship with the dear Lord, we have the deep sense that we are in grace, having grace for our strength and enjoyment and for our every need. If we need life, grace is life. If we need strength and comfort, grace is our strength and comfort. Therefore, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us and grant us grace that we would not be brought to nothing from You. We want to abide in You as the all-inclusive One to enjoy Your riches.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) By the Spirit and out of Faith Operating through Love</h2>
<p>In verse 5 Paul says, &ldquo;For we by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness.&rdquo; The expression <em>by the Spirit</em> is in contrast to <em>by the flesh</em> (3:3). Furthermore, <em>out of faith</em> is in contrast to <em>out of the works of law</em> (v. 2). The hope of righteousness is not out of the works of law in the flesh but out of faith in the Spirit. By the Spirit and by faith we expect Christ as the hope of righteousness.</p>
<p>In 5:5 Paul puts the Spirit together with faith. In order to have the proper enjoyment of Christ, we need to have the Spirit as the all-inclusive land and faith as the means to enjoy the land. Just as the law and the flesh go together, so faith and the Spirit go together. Whenever we try to keep the law, we are immediately in the flesh, but when we take the way of faith to hear the word of Christ, appreciate Him, and call upon His name, we spontaneously experience the Spirit. This can be confirmed by our experience. Whenever we strive to keep the law, we are in the flesh, in the fallen man, but whenever we take the way of faith, we are in our spirit enjoying the Spirit. Here, in the way of faith, we enjoy the Spirit as the processed Triune God. Furthermore, the way of faith causes the organic union between the processed God and regenerated man to be developed and cultivated. God intends that this organic union be developed to the uttermost.</p>
<p>In 5:6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love.&rdquo; Apart from the Spirit and faith, nothing else avails. In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What avails is the Spirit on God&rsquo;s side and faith on our side. The Spirit is the all-inclusive land for our enjoyment, and faith is the organ by which we participate in this rich land and enjoy it. Because the Spirit and faith avail, we should treasure them.</p>
<p>In 5:6 Paul also says that faith operates through love. Living faith is active. It operates through love to work out the fulfillment of the law (v. 14). Circumcision is simply an outward ordinance, having no power of life; hence, it avails nothing. Faith receives the Spirit of life (3:2); thus, it is full of power. It operates through love to fulfill not only the law but also God&rsquo;s purpose, that is, to complete the sonship of God for His corporate expression&mdash;the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Love is related to our appreciation of Christ. Without such an appreciation, faith cannot operate. The hearing of faith awakens our loving appreciation, and the more we love the Lord, the more faith operates to bring us into the riches, the profit, of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Through the Cross&mdash;the Crucifixion of Our Flesh</h2>
<p>In 5:11 Paul says, &ldquo;If I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been annulled.&rdquo; Circumcision foreshadowed the dealing with man&rsquo;s flesh; the cross is the reality of that dealing (Col. 2:11-12). The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality. Circumcision is a type of the cross of Christ; it typifies the cutting off of the flesh that is accomplished by the cross. Therefore, the cross is the fulfillment and the reality of the type of circumcision.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. No Occasion Being Left for the Flesh but<br />
for Us to Serve One Another as Slaves through Love</h2>
<p>In Galatians 5:13 Paul says, &ldquo;For you were called for freedom, brothers; only do not turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.&rdquo; This verse indicates that although Christ has freed us from the slavery of the law, we should leave no occasion for the flesh; rather, we should serve one another through love. On the one hand, Paul tells us that we were called to freedom; on the other hand, he warns us not to use this freedom for an occasion for the flesh. While Paul encourages the believers to enjoy their freedom in Christ, he is also concerned that they may misuse or abuse this freedom. Since we may overindulge ourselves in our freedom, we still need to be limited in the exercise of our freedom. Freedom without limitation always results in the indulgence of the flesh. Therefore, we need to be balanced&mdash;free yet restricted. If we are limited in the use of our freedom, we will love others and through love serve them as slaves.</p>
<p>Freedom with limitation leads us to love others and, through love, to serve them as slaves (v. 13). Instead of turning freedom into an occasion for the flesh, we should be limited in the use of freedom and be willing to serve one another as slaves. As Paul says in 5:14, &ldquo;The whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo; In 5:13-14 Paul admonishes us to have a proper walk in the church life. We need to care not only for ourselves but also for others. We may enjoy the freedom we have yet still be restricted in love for the sake of others that the church life may go on in a good way.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. That We Might Walk by the Spirit,<br />
Not Fulfilling the Lust of the Flesh</h2>
<p>Christ has set us free from the slavery of the law that we might walk by the Spirit, not fulfilling the lust of the flesh. In 5:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered <em>walk</em> means &ldquo;to tread all around, to walk at large&rdquo;; hence, to deport oneself, move, and act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk (cf. Rom. 6:4; 8:4; Phil. 3:17-18).</p>
<p>According to the context of the chapter, the Spirit in Galatians 5:16 must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit from within our spirit. This is in contrast to having our walk regulated by the law in the realm of our flesh.</p>
<p>We should not go back to the law. If we try to keep the law, attempting to do good in order to please God, we will be in the flesh, for the law is related to the flesh. Whenever we try to fulfill the requirements of the law, we exercise our flesh. This means that the flesh is active not only when we do evil but even when we try to fulfill the law. Whenever we in ourselves try to do good works, the flesh is active.</p>
<p>The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man (Gen. 6:3), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God (John 7:39). Because of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and the Spirit&rsquo;s work of regeneration, we who have received God&rsquo;s dispensing can walk by the Spirit, by the processed Triune God, instead of by the flesh, by our fallen being. Paul wrote Galatians not only to rescue the distracted Galatian believers from the law, on the negative side, but also, on the positive side, to bring them into the realization that the believers have the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their spirit that they may live, walk, and have their being in this Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to say in 5:18, &ldquo;But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.&rdquo; The law is related to our flesh (Rom. 7:5), and our flesh is against the Spirit (Gal. 5:17). Hence, the Spirit is in contrast to the law. When we walk by the Spirit, who is in our regenerated spirit, we will not fulfill the lusts of our flesh (v. 16); when we are led by the Spirit, we are not under the law. The Spirit of life, not the law of letters, is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit. If we walk by the Spirit, automatically we will no longer be under the law, for the Spirit will lead us away from the law of letters.</p>
<p>In 5:25 Paul continues, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent on and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law. To walk by the Spirit is to have our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit, not by the law. Since our life is not by the law of letters but by the Spirit of life, our walk also should be not by the law of ordinances but by the Spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>Both the walk in verse 16 and the walk in verse 25 are by the Spirit and are regulated by the Spirit. The former refers to a general, daily walk; the latter, to a walk that takes God&rsquo;s unique goal as the direction and purpose of life, and a walk that follows the Spirit as the elementary rule, the basic principle. For the former, the Spirit is our essence; for the latter, the Spirit is our way.</p>
<p>In Galatians, Paul indicates that the law had become not only the essence of the life of the Galatians but also the path for their way; hence, they had to return to the Spirit and leave the law on the cross. Like the Galatians, we may live not according to Christ but according to the law. Instead of having Christ as the unique constituent of our daily walk, we may have the laws of social ethics, the laws of biblical ethical principles, or self-made laws as our constituent. As a result, much of the time we may live according to these laws instead of Christ. Therefore, we need to take the Spirit as the essence of our daily life in place of the law. If we live by the Spirit as our essence, we should also take the Spirit as our pathway to reach God&rsquo;s goal. Taking the Spirit as our essence and pathway excludes law, doctrine, religion, tradition, and regulations. The processed Triune God who lives in us as the life-giving Spirit should be the essence of our new being and the path for our way. We should walk by the Spirit and live a life which is Christ Himself. Walking by the Spirit as our way, we will be able to reach the goal and gain the prize, which is Christ Himself (Phil. 3:12).</p><h2 class="head4">f. Living a Life of One Who Is of Christ</h2>
<p>In Galatians 5:24 Paul says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>they who are of Christ Jesus</em> refers to those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Him. Therefore, they belong to Christ and are of Christ. As believers in Christ, we are now of Christ.</p>
<p>The crucifixion of the old man in Romans 6:6 and the crucifixion of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; in Galatians 2:20 were not accomplished by us, but 5:24 says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. The old man and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; are our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living. The crucifixion of our old man and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, whereas the crucifying of our flesh with its passions and its lusts is our practical experience of the fact. This practical experience must be carried out through the Spirit by our executing of the crucifixion that Christ accomplished. This is to put to death by the Spirit the practices of our lustful body with its evil members (Rom. 8:13b; Col. 3:5).</p>
<p>There are three aspects of the experience of the cross: (1) the fact accomplished by Christ (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20); (2) our application of the accomplished fact (5:24); and (3) our experience of what we have applied, by bearing the cross daily (Matt. 16:24; Luke 9:23).</p>
<p>Based upon the fact that Christ has crucified our old man and the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; we who are of Christ Jesus &ldquo;have crucified&rdquo; the flesh. In our experience we need to apply Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion to our flesh. Paul&rsquo;s use of the perfect tense to describe this in Galatians 5:24 indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers. All believers should be those who have applied Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion to their flesh. Here Paul is speaking according to principle. If we have never crucified our flesh, our experience is abnormal. If our experience is normal, we who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ gives us the standing, the basis, to deal with the flesh. Our whole being&mdash;the entire fallen tripartite man&mdash;was crucified with Christ on the cross. Now we have not only this base objectively but also the divine life and the Spirit subjectively to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh. If we apply the cross to our flesh by the indwelling Spirit, our flesh will be nailed to the cross. Now that the flesh is on the cross, only the Spirit remains. We need to exercise the spirit by the divine life to apply the cross to our flesh. In so doing, we apply what Christ has accomplished by crucifying our old man with Him on the cross.</p>
<p>In the eyes of God, all those who believe in Christ have already crucified their flesh, but when in our actual experience we execute the crucifixion of Christ by applying the cross to our flesh, we are immediately uplifted to the heavenlies and experience the Spirit as everything to us. Experiencing the Spirit in this way, we walk by the Spirit and are led by the Spirit.</p>
<p>Galatians unveils that the law misused is in opposition to Christ (2:16) and that the flesh lusts against the Spirit (5:17). The cross has nullified the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; which inclines to keep the law (2:20), and the flesh, which lusts against the Spirit, that Christ may replace the law and the Spirit may replace the flesh. God does not want us to keep the law by the flesh; He wants us to live Christ by the Spirit.</p>
<p>In summary, as the Emancipator, Christ has set us free from the slavery of the law, bringing us into grace by the Spirit and out of faith operating through love. Although we were called to this freedom in grace, we should not misuse this freedom. Rather, we should serve one another as slaves through love. Moreover, we must walk by the Spirit, not fulfilling the lust of the flesh but living a life of one who is of Christ by executing the cross of Christ on our flesh.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">60. The Creator of the New Creation</h2>
<p>Galatians 6:12-18 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Creator of the new creation, which is the ultimate issue of His cross and His grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Through His Cross Crucifying:</h2>
<p>Through His cross, Christ crucified not only the flesh but also the religious world with its rituals, including circumcision.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Religious World with Its Rituals</h2>
<p>The cross of Christ did away with religion. In Galatians 6:14-15 Paul says, &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; The cross was truly an abasement, but the apostle made it his boast. The world has been crucified to us and we to the world. This has taken place not directly but through Christ, who was crucified. The word <em>for</em> at the beginning of verse 15 indicates that this verse is an explanation of the previous verse. Circumcision mentioned in verse 15, being a religious matter, shows that <em>the world</em> in verse 14 must be mainly the religious world, not the secular world. In Galatians Paul dealt with religious people who were concerned for the things of God but who also were misguided and in error and whose religion had become a world. On the one hand, the religious world was crucified to us; on the other hand, we were crucified to the religious world. By the cross we are separated from the religious world and are thus qualified to live in the new creation.</p>
<p>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything to God. A new creation is what matters, and this new creation was brought forth by the cross of Christ. The old creation is our old man in Adam (Eph. 4:22), our natural being by birth, without God&rsquo;s life and the divine nature. The new creation is the new man in Christ (v. 24), our being that is regenerated by the Spirit (John 3:6), having God&rsquo;s life and the divine nature wrought into it (v. 36; 2 Pet. 1:4), having Christ as its constituent (Col. 3:10-11), and having become a new constitution. This refers to the nature, the inward and intrinsic organic constituent, of the church. Thus, the new creation is composed of sons; it is a corporate, divine sonship (Gal. 3:26; 4:5, 7) brought forth through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the Spirit&rsquo;s regeneration, and God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us, and through our entering collectively as this new man into an organic union with the Triune God.</p>
<p>The old creation was old because it did not have God&rsquo;s element; the new creation is new because it has God as its element. Although we are still the old creation, we experience the reality of the new creation when we walk according to the Spirit (5:16, 25). We are the new creation, and we should live by the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God. This new creation fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to express Himself in His sonship.</p>
<p>Circumcision is an ordinance of the law; the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature. The former is of dead letters; the latter is of the living Spirit. Hence, the new creation is what matters. Galatians exposes the impotence of both the law and circumcision. The law cannot impart life (3:21) to regenerate us, and circumcision cannot energize us (5:6) to live a new creation. But the Son of God, who has been revealed in us (1:16), can enliven us and make us a new creation, and Christ, who lives in us (2:20), can afford us the riches of His life that we may live the new creation. The law has been replaced by Christ (vv. 19-20), and circumcision has been fulfilled by Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion (6:14). Hence, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation with Christ as its life is what matters. To be the new creation is the reason for and result of sowing unto the Spirit (v. 8). The keeping of the law and the practicing of circumcision are a sowing unto the flesh; they do not change the old creation. But sowing unto the Spirit makes us a new creation, which is re-created by the Spirit, transformed by the divine life, and constituted with the rich element of the processed Triune God by His mingling of Himself with us.</p>
<p>If we would live the new creation, we need to experience the cross. If we are still involved with the religious world, we will not be able to live a new creation. We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world. We should be able to testify that even if we were to try to go back to that world, we would be rejected by it, for we have been crucified to it. Even if Paul had desired to return to Judaism, the religionists would not have accepted him. Rather, they would have commanded him to leave, for he was in another world. To Judaism Paul had been crucified, and Judaism had been crucified to him. Between him and the religious world there was the separation of the cross. It is this separation which qualifies us to live a new creation. Everything practiced in the religious world is part of the old creation. But through the cross of Christ, we are finished with religion and are in another world, another realm. In this realm we live a new creation by the Spirit, not the old creation by the flesh.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Flesh</h2>
<p>Through His cross, Christ crucified not only the religious world but also the flesh. Through His death on the cross Christ dealt with the flesh. In 6:12-13 Paul speaks of the flesh and the cross of Christ: &ldquo;As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.&rdquo; Circumcision, like the cross, is not a good show but an abasement. However, the Judaizers made it a good show as a boast in the flesh. The expression <em>in the flesh</em> in verse 12 means outwardly in the sphere of the flesh, which is condemned and repudiated by God. To be in the flesh is to be in our natural and external being without the inward reality and spiritual value that are in our regenerated spirit. In contrast to the Judaizers who boasted of circumcision in the flesh and compelled others to be circumcised so that they could boast in their flesh, Paul boasted in the cross of Christ through which the religious world and the flesh were crucified (v. 14). Because of the cross of Christ, the law, the flesh, and religion have all been terminated. If we see this vision, we will praise the Lord for the cross. By the cross we are set free from the law, the flesh, and religion.</p>
<p>We should boast in the cross of Christ and live a new creation. The cross of Christ is our boast. We boast in the fact that everything has been terminated on the cross. Since we boast in the cross, we cannot live in the old creation; instead, we must live in the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. By His Grace Being with the Believers&rsquo; Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ created the new creation by His grace being with the believers&rsquo; spirit. In 6:18 Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.&rdquo; The grace of Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Triune God (who is embodied in the Son and realized as the life-giving Spirit) enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit. Grace is God the Father embodied in the Son who is realized as the Spirit. Ultimately, the Spirit is grace (Heb. 10:29). This Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, now dwells in our spirit. Thus, our spirit is the only place where we can experience grace. In order to receive and enjoy grace, we need to turn to our spirit and remain there, recognizing the Lord as the Head and the King, respecting His position, and honoring His authority. We need to see that the throne of grace is in our spirit (4:16). Whenever we come to the throne of grace by turning to our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord, giving Him the headship, the kingship, and the lordship within us (Col. 1:18; Rev. 4:2). God&rsquo;s throne is the source of the flowing grace. Whenever we fail to enthrone the Lord, dethroning Him, the flow of grace stops (22:1). If we enthrone the Lord Jesus within us, the Spirit as the river of water of life will flow from the throne of grace to supply us and we will receive grace and enjoy grace (Heb. 4:16; cf. Rev. 22:1-2).</p>
<p>We need to be those who receive and enjoy the grace of the Lord in our spirit. The receiving of Christ as the Spirit of grace is a lifelong, continuous matter. Day by day a marvelous divine transmission should take place: God supplies the Spirit of grace bountifully, and we receive the Spirit of grace continually (Gal. 3:2-5; John 3:34). The way to open ourselves to the heavenly transmission in order to receive the supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of grace is by exercising our spirit to pray and call on the Lord (1 Thes. 5:16-18; Rom. 10:12-13). As we receive and enjoy the Triune God as our grace, we will gradually become one with Him organically; He will become our constituent, and we will become His expression (2 Cor. 1:12; 12:9).</p>
<p>The mark of God&rsquo;s economy is that Christ today is the grace of God in our spirit. Our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit is the focus of God&rsquo;s promised blessing. It is in our spirit that we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the central blessing of the New Testament. Hence, we need the grace of the Lord, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit (Phil. 1:19), to be with our spirit. If we do not know our human spirit, which has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, we have no way to enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. We need to learn to exercise our spirit and to walk in our spirit in order to enjoy the grace of Christ, which is Christ Himself for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Christ, the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit are the four basic items revealed in Galatians as the underlying thought of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. When Christ is realized through the Spirit in our spirit, we become the new creation. The new creation is Christ living in our spirit. Hence, our spirit is vital for us to live the life of the new creation for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><h2 class="head5">1) Walking by the Rule of Being a New Creation</h2>
<p>The grace of Christ is with the spirit of the believers who walk by the rule of being a new creation. In Galatians 6:16 Paul says, &ldquo;As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.&rdquo; The rule Paul mentions in this verse refers to the rule of being a new creation, of living by the Spirit through faith, having the Triune God as our life and living, in contrast to keeping the law by observing ordinances. We need to walk by the rule which is the Triune God processed to be our life and living. To live in this way by the new creation is our rule.</p>
<p>To walk in the Spirit is to walk in the new creation. In 5:25 Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit, and in 6:16 he charges us to walk by &ldquo;this rule.&rdquo; This indicates that to walk by this rule is to walk by the Spirit. In other words, the rule is equal to the Spirit. To walk by such a rule is to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Only this kind of living and walk which is by the Spirit is part of the new creation.</p>
<p>We should walk by the principle of the new creation, the mingling of God with man. The basic principle of the new creation is that we should live by the divine life (2:20; John 6:57). In order to be the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God. Everything outside this union is part of the old creation. To live the new creation is to walk by the divine life and divine nature as a governing principle. Walking by the principle of the new creation is mysterious because it is an organic matter altogether related to life (3:8). When we have this walk, we are a new creation not only in position and nature but also in daily practice. If we would live the new creation, we must do everything in oneness with the Triune God, and the element of God must be wrought into us (15:4-5; 1 Cor. 6:17). To live the new creation is to live, walk, have our being, and do all things, great or small, with the element of God. In all that we do, we should act not in ourselves but according to our regenerated spirit filled with the divine element.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rule in Galatians 6:16 is that of sowing unto the Spirit to live the new creation. This rule is to aim at the processed Triune God as the Spirit and to walk by Him (v. 8). We should not aim at self-correction or self-improvement; such things are not the new creation. The meaning of the new creation is that God, the divine Spirit, mingles Himself with us and constitutes us with Himself to make us new. When we aim at the Triune God and walk by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the Spirit imparts the divine element into us and reconstitutes us with it. As a result, we no longer remain the old creation but become a new creation with a divine element wrought into us. The ultimate issue of this will be the New Jerusalem. The new creation is a matter of God&rsquo;s chosen people taking the all-inclusive Spirit as their goal, aiming at Him, being one spirit with Him, and, as a result, having the divine element transfused into them to reconstitute them and make them new.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Bearing the Brands of Jesus in Their Body</h2>
<p>The grace of Christ is with the spirit of the believers who walk by the rule of being a new creation, bearing the brands of Jesus in their body. In 6:17 Paul says, &ldquo;Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.&rdquo; In ancient times, when a person became a slave, his owner would brand him with a branding iron. This branding on the slave&rsquo;s body produced a scar, which was a mark signifying ownership. Paul considered himself a slave of Christ. Just as a slave might bear a brand mark testifying that he belonged to a certain owner, Paul bore in his body the brands of Jesus. It was as if the name of Christ had been branded upon him again and again as a testimony and declaration that Paul belonged to the Lord.</p>
<p>With Paul, a slave of Christ (Rom. 1:1), the brands were physically the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master (2 Cor. 11:23-27). Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life that he lived, a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on this earth. Such a life is continually crucified (John 12:24), does the will of God (6:38), does not seek its own glory but the glory of God (7:18), and is submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross (Phil. 2:8). The apostle followed the pattern of the Lord Jesus, bearing the brands, the characteristics of His life. In this he was absolutely different from the Judaizers. Whereas the Judaizers, who boasted in circumcision, desired to make a good show, a good appearance, in their flesh, the apostle bore the brands of Jesus in his body.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the spiritual significance of the expression <em>the brands of Jesus</em> is that Paul lived a crucified life. As we read the four Gospels, we see the portrait of a man constantly living a crucified life; this kind of life is a brand. Thus, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He bore such a brand. He was persecuted, ridiculed, despised, and rejected. However, He did not say anything to defend Himself. Instead, living a crucified life, He bore a brand to show that He belonged to the Father. Paul followed the Lord Jesus to live this kind of life. In Philippians 3:10 he refers to &ldquo;the fellowship of His sufferings.&rdquo; As one who lived in the fellowship of Jesus&rsquo; sufferings, Paul bore the brands of Jesus as the sign that he lived a crucified life. Because he was persecuted, despised, ridiculed, rejected, and condemned, he could truly say that he bore the brands of Jesus.</p>
<p>As long as we take the way of the cross, we too will be opposed by others. If we are faithful to live a crucified life, opposition will rise up again and again. In Galatians 4:29 Paul says, &ldquo;As at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.&rdquo; This word indicates clearly that those who are according to the flesh will persecute those who are according to the Spirit. Just as the Lord Jesus and Paul were persecuted because they lived a crucified life, the same will happen to us if, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, we follow their footsteps to live such a life. When we are despised, rejected, condemned, ridiculed, and mocked, we bear the brands of Jesus.</p>
<p>Anyone who enjoys the Lord&rsquo;s grace to walk by the rule of being a new creation and who leaves religion as the Lord Jesus did is destined to bear His brands. This is because Jesus was put outside the camp of Judaism and was crucified outside the gate of the city of Jerusalem; this kind of suffering is a brand of Jesus (Heb. 13:12-13). We should be those who bear such a brand of Jesus, leaving any kind of religion and living a life absolutely in Christ. We should have nothing to do with religion; instead, we should only be in Christ, a living person, and always live the life of Jesus, a life under the killing of the cross.</p>
<p>Galatians places strong emphasis on the cross and the experience of crucifixion, in order to deal with the negative items, such as the law, the flesh, the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the religious world, slavery, and the curse, thereby bringing in the positive items that are revealed in this book: Christ, the Spirit, the sons of God, the heirs of promise, and the new creation. It is significant that at the end of Galatians, Paul speaks of the grace of the Lord being with the believers&rsquo; spirit, their walking by the rule of being a new creation, and their bearing the brands of Jesus in their body. Through the cross of Christ the law, the flesh, and religion were terminated so that we might possess the Spirit in our spirit and that through the Spirit, the realization of Christ, we might be the new creation, bearing the brands of Jesus and enjoying the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in our spirit.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(39)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ unveiled in Ephesians. Although the New Testament reveals many aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment, the aspects of Christ in Ephesians are much deeper than those in other books of the New Testament. This is because the aspects of Christ revealed in Ephesians are for the producing of the church and the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">61. The Sphere and the Means<br />
of the Spiritual Blessings in the Heavenlies</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:3-14 we see that Christ is the sphere and the means of the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies. Ephesians 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.&rdquo; The expression <em>in Christ,</em> which is mentioned numerous times in this Epistle, indicates that Christ is the sphere and the means of all the divine, spiritual, and heavenly blessings (1:1, 10, 12, 20; 2:6-7, 10, 13; 3:6, 11, 21; 4:32). Christ is the virtue, the instrument, and the sphere in which God has blessed us. Outside of Christ, apart from Christ, God has nothing to do with us; but in Christ He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies. Moreover, Christ is the element of the divine blessing; that is, Christ Himself is the divine blessing.</p>
<p>All the blessings with which God has blessed us, being spiritual, are related to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God is not only the channel but also the reality of God&rsquo;s blessings. The Spirit is the nature and essence of the divine blessing we have received. In verse 3 God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are all related to the blessings bestowed on us; God&rsquo;s blessing us is actually His dispensing Himself into us. The Father is the source of the divine blessing, Christ the Son is the element of the blessing, and the Spirit is the nature and essence of the blessing.</p>
<p>The blessings are not only spiritual but also in the heavenlies. The word <em>heavenlies</em> here indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere of the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us. These blessings are from the heavens, having a heavenly nature, heavenly state, heavenly characteristic, heavenly taste, and heavenly atmosphere. The believers in Christ are enjoying on earth these heavenly blessings, which are spiritual as well as heavenly. They are different from the blessings with which God blessed Israel. Those blessings were physical and earthly. The blessings bestowed on us are of God the Father, in God the Son, through God the Spirit, and in the heavenlies. They are the spiritual blessings bestowed by the Triune God on us, the believers in Christ. They are the blessings in the heavenlies, having a heavenly nature, state, character, and atmosphere.</p>
<p>The word <em>blessing</em> in 1:3 literally means &ldquo;good speech, or, utterance, well speaking, or fair speech; implying bounty and benefit.&rdquo; God has blessed us with His good, fine, and fair speakings. Every such speaking is a blessing to us. Verses 4 through 14 are an account of such speakings, such blessings. All these blessings are spiritual, in the heavenlies, and in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God&rsquo;s Choosing</h2>
<p>The first among all God&rsquo;s blessings is His choosing us, His selecting us, in eternity past. In eternity past, He chose us; we were His choice. In 1:4 Paul says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love.&rdquo; From among numberless people God, according to His infinite foresight, selected us, and this He did in Christ. Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God. Outside of Christ we are not God&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>Our being chosen does not depend on what we are or what we do. It depends on what Christ is, what He has done, and what He will do for us. None of us is worthy of God&rsquo;s selection. However, God selected us, not in ourselves, in our situation, or in our sphere but in Christ as the means, the sphere, the condition, and the circumstance. Christ is everything for God&rsquo;s selection of us.</p>
<p>God chose us that we should be holy. Here <em>holy</em> means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things. Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature. He chose us that we should be holy. He makes us holy by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into our being, that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us, God&rsquo;s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of God&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself. This is different from mere sinless perfection or sinless purity. This makes our being holy in God&rsquo;s nature and character, just like God Himself.</p>
<p>God chose us that we should be not only holy but also without blemish. A blemish is like a foreign particle in a precious gem. God&rsquo;s chosen ones should be saturated with only God Himself, having no foreign particles, such as the fallen natural human element, the flesh, the self, or worldly things. This is to be without blemish, without any mixture, without any element other than God&rsquo;s holy nature. The church, after being thoroughly washed by the water in the word, will be sanctified in such a way (Eph. 5:26-27).</p>
<p>In ourselves we are unholy and imperfect, but in Christ we are holy and perfect. We should not look at ourselves but at Him. Moreover, we all need to consider one another according to Christ, not according to ourselves; we need to regard all the believers as holy brothers and sisters in Christ. Because there is nothing unholy or imperfect in Christ, we are all holy and perfect in Him. God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish.</p><h2 class="head4">b. God&rsquo;s Predestination</h2>
<p>Following God&rsquo;s choosing us to be holy is His predestinating us to be His sons. In eternity past, before the foundation of the world, we were predestinated, marked out, by God. Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; <em>Through Jesus Christ</em> means through the Redeemer who is the Son of God. Through Him we were redeemed to be the sons of God with the life and position of God&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<p>The Greek words translated &ldquo;predestinating us&rdquo; can also be rendered &ldquo;marking us out beforehand.&rdquo; Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose, which is to determine a destiny beforehand. God selected us before the foundation of the world, marking us out beforehand unto a certain destiny.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s marking us out beforehand was to destine us unto sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God&rsquo;s creatures we need to be regenerated by Him that we may participate in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies having not only the life but also the position of a son. God&rsquo;s marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and the position to inherit Him. To be made holy&mdash;to be sanctified by God by His putting Himself into us and then mingling His nature with us&mdash;is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the aim, the goal, and is a matter of our being joined to the Son of God and conformed to a particular form or shape, the very image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:15), that our whole being, including our body (Rom. 8:23), may be &ldquo;sonized&rdquo; by God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s choosing and predestination are related to the grace of God. In Ephesians 1:6 Paul says, &ldquo;To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.&rdquo; What is revealed in this verse is the issue of predestination unto sonship mentioned in the preceding verse. This means that the praise of the glory of God&rsquo;s grace is the result, the issue, of the sonship (v. 5). God&rsquo;s predestinating us unto sonship is for the praise of His expression in His grace, that is, for the praise of the glory of His grace. Eventually, every positive thing in the universe will praise God for sonship (Rom. 8:19), thus fulfilling what is spoken in this verse.</p>
<p>The grace of God is God coming to be everything to us and to do everything for us. Whatever God came to be to us and to do for us is God Himself as grace coming to us in His incarnation. This is clearly revealed in John 1, which tells us that God as the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality, and that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ (vv. 14, 16-17).</p>
<p>Grace is what God is to us for our enjoyment, whereas glory is God expressed (Exo. 40:34). <em>The glory of His grace</em> indicates that God&rsquo;s grace, which is God Himself as our enjoyment, expresses Him. God is expressed in His grace, and His predestination is for the praise of this expression. As we receive grace and enjoy God, we have the sense of glory. Grace is God Himself as our enjoyment, glory is God manifested, and the glory of God&rsquo;s grace is God expressed in our enjoyment of Him.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:6 says that God has graced us in the Beloved. For God to grace us means that He has put us into the position of grace that we may be the object of God&rsquo;s grace and favor, that is, that we may enjoy all that God is. Because we are in the position of grace and are the object of grace, God is pleased with us, His delight is in us, and we are enjoying Him and becoming His enjoyment. Hence, there is a mutual enjoyment: we enjoy Him, and He enjoys us. Here, in grace, He is our joy and satisfaction, and we are His joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Beloved in verse 6 is Christ, God&rsquo;s beloved Son, in whom He delights (Matt. 3:17; 17:5). Hence, in gracing us God makes us an object in whom He delights. This is altogether a pleasure to God. In Christ we have been blessed by God with every blessing. In the Beloved we were graced, made the object of God&rsquo;s favor and pleasure. As such an object we enjoy God, and God enjoys us in His grace in His Beloved, who is His delight. In His Beloved we, too, become His delight.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>in the Beloved</em> conveys the full delight, satisfaction, and enjoyment God the Father has in us because we have been made the object of His grace and delight. In this sense we should all appreciate ourselves and even esteem ourselves highly because we have been positioned in grace and made the object of God&rsquo;s delight. We should have such a view about ourselves, not according to our natural state, but according to the fact that we have been chosen, predestinated, regenerated, and graced. God delights in us, not in ourselves, but in His Beloved. Having become the object of God&rsquo;s grace, we have been favored in Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, God&rsquo;s rich grace has accomplished redemption for us and has applied forgiveness to us (Eph. 1:7). God&rsquo;s grace is not only rich (v. 7) but also abounding (v. 8). The riches of God&rsquo;s grace have been caused to abound to us, on the one hand, in all wisdom for God&rsquo;s plan in eternity and, on the other hand, in all prudence for God&rsquo;s execution of His plan in time. God&rsquo;s abounding grace, as we will see in this message, accomplishes the heading up of all things in Christ (v. 10), makes us an inheritance to God (v. 11), and qualifies us to inherit all that God is (v. 14).</p><h2 class="head4">d. God&rsquo;s Redemption</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:7 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace.&rdquo; Verse 7 is the continuation of verse 6. As previously mentioned, verse 6 reveals that we have become the object of God&rsquo;s favor, for we have been graced in the Beloved. The phrase <em>in whom</em> in verse 7 refers to <em>the Beloved</em> in verse 6. This means that we have been redeemed in the Beloved, in the One in whom God delights. Thus, in the eyes of God, redemption is not a pitiful matter; it is a thing to be delighted in. The expression <em>in the Beloved</em> means in God&rsquo;s delight. In God&rsquo;s delight, the Beloved, we have redemption. We have been redeemed through the blood shed for us by God&rsquo;s Beloved on the cross.</p>
<p>We were chosen and predestinated in eternity past, but after being created, we became fallen. For Him to work out His plan with us, God needed to accomplish redemption in Christ through His blood in order to solve all the problems between us and God. This is another item of God&rsquo;s blessings that He has bestowed on us.</p>
<p>The forgiveness of our offenses is the redemption through the blood of Christ. Apart from the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). Because Christ&rsquo;s death in the flesh on the cross has fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, His blood becomes the instrument for our redemption. Redemption is what Christ accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is the application of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment to our offenses. Redemption was accomplished on the cross when Christ shed His blood, whereas forgiveness is applied by the Spirit of God when we believe in Christ and make confession to the righteous God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Heading Up of All Things</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:10 Paul says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; We need to note that it is in Christ that God intends to head up all things. The word <em>Christ</em> here literally means &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo;; it refers to the One mentioned in verse 1 and verse 3, the One in whom are the spiritual blessings of God and in whom are the faithful saints, who participate in the blessings. He is a particular One; hence, He is called &ldquo;the Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered <em>economy</em> in verse 10 is <em>oikonomia,</em> which means &ldquo;house law, household management or administration, and derivatively, administrative dispensation, plan, or economy.&rdquo; The economy that God, according to His desire, planned and purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times. This is accomplished through the dispensing of the abundant life supply of the Triune God as the life factor into all the members of the church that they may rise up from the death situation and be attached to the Body.</p>
<p>The expression <em>the times</em> in verse 10 refers to the ages. The fullness of the times will be when the new heaven and new earth appear after all the dispensations of God in all the ages have been completed. Altogether there are four ages: the age of sin (Adam), the age of the law (Moses), the age of grace (Christ), and the age of the kingdom (the millennium).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to head up all things in Christ, who has been appointed to be the universal Head. Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth. That will be God&rsquo;s eternal administration and economy. Thus, the heading up of all things is the issue of all the items covered in verses 3 through 9. God chose us to be holy, predestinated us unto sonship, accomplished redemption for us through the blood of Christ, graced us in the Beloved, and caused grace to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence in order that He may head up all things in Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 says that God gave Christ to be Head over all things. This reveals that the heading up of all things is to the church so that the Body of Christ may share in all that is of Christ as the Head, having been rescued from the heap of the universal collapse in death and darkness, which was caused by the rebellion of the angels and the rebellion of man. In Christ God is in the process of heading up all things in heaven and on earth. However, without the church as the Body to match Christ as the Head, it will not be possible for God to head up all things in Christ. The heading up of all things is accomplished by the Head, but it cannot be accomplished without a Body for the Head. Whether Christ can be the Head over all things, whether all things can be subjected to the authority of Christ, and whether all things can be headed up in Christ completely depend upon whether or not the church has been produced and has grown up (4:14-16; Col. 2:19). When the church is fully grown, God is able to subject all things to the authority of Christ. By means of the church, Christ is able to be the Head over all things. Eventually, the Body with Christ as the Head will be the universal Head over all things. When everything is headed up in Christ, there will be absolute peace and harmony (Isa. 2:4; 11:6; 55:12; Psa. 96:12-13), a full rescue out of the collapse. This will begin from the time of the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21).</p>
<p>When God created the universe, everything of the universe was in oneness; all things in it were in harmony, not in chaos. God and the universe were in harmony. This harmony is the great oneness of the universe. All things related to the universe depend on God, who is one, as the factor of their oneness. The center of the universe is God Himself; hence, the oneness of the universe is God Himself. There was oneness in the creation of the universe, and in this oneness there was no confusion. Yet because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, which was followed by man&rsquo;s fall, this original oneness in creation was ruined so that the entire universe was brought into confusion. Satan damaged the oneness of the universe in creation by introducing death into all creation, which death severed the Creator&rsquo;s relationship with creation. In other words, when Satan brought death into the universe, the universe was separated from God and the oneness of the universe was lost. Thus, there is not the full harmony in the universe.</p>
<p>Yet God had an eternal plan to head up all things in Christ, that is, to make Christ the Head of all things and the Head above all things. God&rsquo;s way to recover the oneness among His creation is to impart Himself in Christ into us as life (Rom. 8:6, 10-11, 19-21). The Triune God as life brings in light, and light issues in harmony and brings all things into oneness. Hence, the believers participate in this heading up by growing in life, by being headed up in the proper church life, and by living under Christ&rsquo;s light (John 1:4; Rev. 21:23-25). The more we grow in life, the more we will be headed up and the more we will be rescued from the universal collapse (Eph. 4:15; Col. 2:19). This process of heading up all things in Christ is still continuing, and the heading up of all things will be fully accomplished and manifested when Christ finishes His work to bring forth the new creation out of the old creation through all the dispensations of God. It is through this new creation that Christ will head up all creation and bring it into the universal oneness; this will issue in the new heaven and the new earth. In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, all things will be headed up in Christ; this will be the complete fulfillment of the heading up of all things spoken of in Ephesians 1:10. In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city. The whole universe will be headed up in the light shown through the transparent city (v. 18).</p><h2 class="head4">f. Our Being Made an Inheritance<br />
in Order to Inherit God as Our Inheritance</h2>
<p>After presenting the revelation of the heading up of all things in Christ, Paul speaks of our being made an inheritance in Christ in order that we may inherit God as our inheritance. In Ephesians 1:11 Paul says, &ldquo;In whom also we were designated as an inheritance.&rdquo; The phrase <em>in whom</em> refers to the heading-up Christ revealed in verse 10, indicating that we have been placed into the heading-up Christ. In ourselves, that is, according to our natural being, we are not worthy to be God&rsquo;s inheritance, but in the heading-up Christ we were made God&rsquo;s inheritance.</p>
<p>The expression <em>in whom</em> in verse 11 implies a sphere and an element. Christ is not only our sphere but also our element with which we are being transformed into a treasure to become God&rsquo;s inheritance, His private and personal possession. We are not only God&rsquo;s redeemed ones in Christ but also God&rsquo;s precious inheritance produced in Christ as the sphere and with Christ as the element of life. To be in Christ is to be in Him as the divine element. Day by day Christ Himself is being wrought into us so that He can become our element. Although we ourselves are pieces of clay unworthy for God to inherit, the divine element has made us an excellent treasure to become God&rsquo;s inheritance. If we live in Christ day by day, we will experience and enjoy Christ not only as the sphere in which we enjoy the dispensing of God Himself into us, but also as the divine element, the producing ingredient, with which God will make us His inheritance.</p>
<p>We were fallen in Adam, but through His redemption Christ brought us out of Adam into Himself as the sphere and the element. Since Christ is now the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), this sphere and element are the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit is our sphere and our element. In this sphere and with this element, the Triune God in Christ as the life-giving Spirit is dispensing Himself into us to transform us metabolically and to make us a particular treasure, God&rsquo;s heritage, God&rsquo;s inheritance. In this universe God is the only One who is precious. Now this precious God of matchless worth is working Himself into us to make us His glorious inheritance.</p>
<p>The Greek words rendered &ldquo;were designated as an inheritance&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;have obtained an inheritance.&rdquo; The Greek verb means &ldquo;to choose or assign by lot.&rdquo; Hence, this clause literally means that in Christ we were designated as a chosen inheritance. We were designated as an inheritance so that we may inherit God as our inheritance. On the one hand, we were made an inheritance to God. On the other hand, we inherit God Himself as our inheritance. Here we have a marvelous mutual inheritance: we have become God&rsquo;s inheritance (v. 18) for God&rsquo;s enjoyment, and God will be our inheritance (v. 14) for our enjoyment. We are in Him to be His inheritance and enjoyment, and He is in us to be our inheritance and our enjoyment.</p>
<p>It is by having God in Christ wrought into us that we are being constituted into an inheritance. We have already been placed in the heading-up Christ, but we are still in the process of being made God&rsquo;s inheritance in full. In this process the natural life must be eliminated, and the divine nature must increase by being wrought into more of our being. God is the treasure, and He is working Himself as the treasure into us that we may become a treasure to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Hope</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:12 Paul speaks of the all-inclusive hope in Christ: &ldquo;We would be to the praise of His glory who have first hoped in Christ.&rdquo; The hope we have in Christ is the hope of God&rsquo;s calling mentioned in verse 18. This divine hope includes (1) Christ Himself and the salvation He will bring to us when He comes back (Col. 1:27; 1 Pet. 1:5, 9); (2) the rapturous transfer from the earthly and physical realm to the heavenly and spiritual sphere, plus glorification (Rom. 8:23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21); (3) the kingly enjoyment with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 5:10; 2 Tim. 4:18); and (4) the consummate enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem, with the universal and eternal blessings in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5).</p>
<p>We, the New Testament believers, are those who have first hoped in Christ, that is, in this age. The Jews will have their hope in Christ in the next age. We have hoped in Christ before He comes back to set up His Messianic kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s Sealing and Pledging</h2>
<p>In 1:13-14 Paul speaks of another spiritual blessing we have in Christ: the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging. &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory.&rdquo; To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. We have been designated as God&rsquo;s inheritance (v. 11). At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</p>
<p>The sealing of the Spirit is the moving of the Spirit within us, and it is spreading throughout our being, daily saturating our mind, emotion, and will. We have been sealed with the sealing Spirit who saturates us, permeates us, and is mingled with us, making Him and us one constitution. Moreover, the more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God and look like God. Through the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing, we express God.</p>
<p>The Greek word for pledge in verse 14 means &ldquo;foretaste, guarantee, that is, token payment, a partial payment in advance, guaranteeing the full payment.&rdquo; Since we are God&rsquo;s inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us. Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge to us of this inheritance. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance. In ancient times the Greek word for <em>pledge</em> was used in the purchasing of land. The seller gave the purchaser some soil as a sample from the land. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we will inherit of God in full.</p>
<p>The pledging of the Spirit is given for our enjoyment. If the Spirit were only the sealing, we might become bored with the experience of the Spirit, but we are not tired or bored of the Spirit because the Spirit is also pledging within us. Some believers do not have a very large appetite for Christ, because they do not care for the pledging of the Spirit. If we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so sweet,&rdquo; the sense of the Spirit&rsquo;s pledging will increase within us. The more the Spirit pledges in us, the more enjoyment of Christ we have. This enjoyment enlarges our appetite for Christ. The more we taste of the Lord, the greater is our appetite for Him, and the more appetite we have, the more we taste Him. By means of this glorious cycle, we daily participate in God until in eternity God will become our full enjoyment, and we will have the full taste of Him.</p>
<p>We enjoy first the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and then His pledging. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s sealing indicates that we are God&rsquo;s inheritance, whereas His pledging in us indicates that God will be our inheritance. The Holy Spirit is the seal of God, a mark placed on us to indicate that we are God&rsquo;s possession and God&rsquo;s inheritance, belonging to God. At the same time, the Holy Spirit is the pledge in us to guarantee to us that God is our possession and our inheritance.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging are not once-for-all matters. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging have begun, are continuing, and will continue to go on in us until the redemption of our body. Every day the Holy Spirit is sealing us, increasingly making us God&rsquo;s inheritance; He is pledging in us, gradually making God our inheritance. The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging will fully transform us.</p>
<p>On the day when we were saved, we hardly looked like God; hence, we hardly looked like God&rsquo;s inheritance. Yet the intensified sealing work of the Holy Spirit within us will increasingly cause us to look like God; as a result, we will truly look like God&rsquo;s inheritance. At the same time, the Holy Spirit is pledging in us, making God our inheritance and giving us the full assurance that God can never remove Himself from our being, for He as the Spirit has been pledged into our being. The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging will fully transform us into a treasure to God and will ultimately make us God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head4">i. The Redemption of Our Body</h2>
<p>The Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in the redemption of our body. In Ephesians 1:13-14 Paul tells us that in Christ we were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise unto the redemption of the acquired possession. Here the expression <em>unto the redemption of the acquired possession</em> gives the purpose of the sealing in verse 13. The seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with God&rsquo;s divine element until we are mature in God&rsquo;s life and eventually fully redeemed, even in our body.</p>
<p><em>Redemption</em> in verse 14 refers to the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance, until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we will inherit God in full. The span of God&rsquo;s blessings bestowed on us covers all the crucial points from God&rsquo;s selection in eternity past (Eph. 1:4) to the redemption of our body for eternity future. All these blessings are not earthly but divine and heavenly. May we all learn to experience and enjoy Christ as the sphere and the means of all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(40)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">62. The Means of the Divine Power</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:19-23 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the means of the divine power. This divine power is God Himself. When God is our enjoyment, He is grace. Grace refers to an aspect of God as our enjoyment. Yet there is another aspect concerning God&rsquo;s being: He is the divine power for His move within us. God is not only grace, the enjoyment within us; He is the divine power, a motivating factor within us. Through regeneration God came into us, and from that time He has always motivated us from within. We the believers are active and aggressive because we have God as the divine power motivating us and strengthening us. Before we were saved, we were, spiritually speaking, dead, but when we believed in the Lord Jesus, God as the divine power came into us through Christ, just as electricity comes to a building by means of an electrical wire. Our God is the divine power, the heavenly electricity, who came into us, and Christ is the means of the divine power, that is, the means through which God as the divine power is conveyed to us.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 1:19 Paul speaks of &ldquo;what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength.&rdquo; The power that is toward us is the Triune God. This power is not only the creating power but the power that has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. After all these steps, the Triune God comes to us as such a power. Within this power, therefore, there is the power of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Hence, it is an all-inclusive power. The power toward us who believe is the Triune God, the Creator of the universe, who was incarnated, passed through crucifixion, entered into resurrection and ascension, and has come down to us. This power has been installed in us, just as electricity is installed in a building. The surpassing greatness of God&rsquo;s power toward us is very subjective and experiential to us today. God&rsquo;s power toward us is surpassingly great. We need to know it and experience it.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Divine Power Operating in Him</h2>
<p>The surpassingly great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ. God&rsquo;s power toward us is the same as the power that He caused to operate in Christ. Christ is the Head, and we are the Body. The Body participates in the power that operates in the Head.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Raising Him from the Dead</h2>
<p>In verse 20 Paul tells us that God caused the divine power to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead. To raise a dead person from Hades and the grave requires much power. The divine power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades, where the dead are held. Death and Hades could not hold Christ (Acts 2:24) because of God&rsquo;s resurrection power.</p>
<p>Apart from Christ, no one has overcome death and come out from the dead. For Christ to be raised up out of death indicates that nothing can hold Him down. When death comes to visit us, we cannot refuse it, for death has power to hold us, but it did not have the power to hold Christ. Although death did everything to hold Him, after visiting the realm of the dead for three days, Christ came forth in resurrection. Just as nothing can hold Christ down, so nothing negative can hold us down, because we have Christ in us.</p>
<p>In order to experience God&rsquo;s resurrection power, we must not tolerate death within us and must have a strong desire to reject death. If we are indifferent toward death, we can never realize the power of resurrection. Conversely, if we hate death and are desperate to be delivered from death, the resurrection power within us will be manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Seating Him in the Heavenlies above All</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 1:20-21, God&rsquo;s power not only raised Christ from the depths of Hades and the grave but also seated Him at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. God&rsquo;s right hand, where Christ was seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. <em>The heavenlies</em> refers not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens, in which Christ was seated by God&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>In verse 21 Paul says that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named. <em>Rule</em> refers to the highest office, <em>authority</em> to every kind of official power (Matt. 8:9), <em>power</em> to the mere might of authority, and <em>lordship</em> to the preeminence that power establishes. Subsequently, we see that what is listed here includes not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, whether good or evil, but also the human, earthly ones. The ascended Christ was seated by the great power of God far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe. <em>Every name that is named</em> refers not only to titles of honor but also to every name. Christ was seated far above every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.</p>
<p>We all need to see the vision that Christ has ascended and is now in the third heaven and that Christ as our Head has lifted us off the earth; hence, we are in the heavens in Him. All the negative things on the earth create a poor environment, but we are sitting in the third heaven looking down at them all. We need a vision to see that since we are attached to the exalted Christ as the ascended Head, we are not on the earth but in the third heaven and are thereby far above all the negative things. This heavenly position is our triumphant victory.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must realize that all our problems are opportunities for us to experience God&rsquo;s transcending power. In a very real sense, we need all the troublesome situations, including our mistakes and sufferings, for God&rsquo;s transcending power to be manifested. In the midst of all our problems, we should declare that deep within us is the transcending power that seated Christ at the right hand of God, far above all. As a result, although others may oppose us or bother us, we will sit together with Christ in the heavenlies and thereby be transcendent in Him (Eph. 2:6). If we experience God&rsquo;s transcending power in all our circumstances, the proper church life as the Body of Christ will be manifested.</p><h2 class="head5">3) Subjecting All Things under His Feet</h2>
<p>In chapter 1 verse 22 Paul indicates that after seating Christ at the right hand of God, God as the divine power subjected all things under His feet. Christ&rsquo;s being far above all is one thing; His having all things subjected under His feet is another. The former is Christ&rsquo;s transcendency; the latter, the subjection of all things to Him.</p>
<p>In order to experience the subjecting power, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, all things have been subjected under Your feet. Now all things must be under me, for You are the subjecting power within me.&rdquo; The more that things are subdued under our feet, the more the church comes into being. Some of us may be subdued by evil or unclean habits, or by the fashions and styles of the present age. In contrast, Paul declared, &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:12). This indicates that although Paul had the real freedom, he was not subdued by anything. We need to experience the subjecting power to live such a subduing life; then all things will be under our feet. If we fully experience God&rsquo;s subjecting power, the Body of Christ will be fully manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) Giving Him to Be the Head over All Things</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:22 Paul goes on to say that God&rsquo;s power which He caused to operate in Christ gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Christ&rsquo;s headship over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God&rsquo;s surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the universe. It was as a man, in His humanity with His divinity, that Christ was raised from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be Head over all things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Transmitted to the Church</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul tells us that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. There are four aspects of the power that operated in Christ: resurrection power (v. 20a), ascending power (v. 20b), subjecting power (v. 22a), and heading-up power (v. 22b). This fourfold power is transmitted to the church, the Body of the Head.</p>
<p>The expression <em>to the church</em> implies a kind of transmission. This transmission connects Christ in the heavens with the believers on the earth, just as an electrical current connects a power plant with electrical appliances in a building. This transmission connects the Head in the heavens with His Body on the earth.</p>
<p>Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments: the resurrection from the dead, His being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things.</p>
<p><em>Toward us who believe</em> (v. 19) and <em>to the church</em> indicate that the divine power, which includes all that the Triune God has passed through, has been installed into us once for all and is being transmitted into us continually, causing us to enjoy Christ richly and to have the proper church life as His Body, His fullness, the issue of God&rsquo;s blessing revealed in Ephesians 1.</p>
<p>The transmission of this fourfold power is to those who believe. We must believe that the divine power motivated Jesus, a genuine man who died and was buried, to rise from Hades, to come out of the grave, and to ascend into heaven as witnessed by the disciples, seating Him at the right hand of God in the third heaven, subjecting all things under His feet and ultimately giving Him to be Head over all things to the church. This is the revelation in the holy Word. We should forget our feelings, our condition, and our situation. Rather, we should take the word concerning the fourfold power, believe the word, and declare the word. By believing we are positioned and qualified to receive the power of God. We need to not only believe God&rsquo;s speaking regarding the power but also echo this again and again by speaking it continually. The more we speak of the fourfold power, the more we will experience this power being transmitted into us. Eventually, through our faith in this transmission and through our speaking it forth, the church will come forth in a practical way.</p>
<p>On the day we repented, the divine power was installed in us. When we open ourselves to the Lord, this power functions to saturate us with the divine essence transmitted into us from the heavens. Because we are not always open or because we may have problems in our conscience, mind, emotion, or will, the transmission may temporarily be restricted. If we would experience a continual transmission, we need to repent, confess, and make a clearance of all hindrances. Then the transmission will be restored and will continue to saturate our being. To enjoy the transmission, we need a sober mind, a fervent emotion, a submissive will, and a pure conscience. Through the experience of this transmission, we become the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head5">1) His Body</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head. The Body of Christ is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, who has come into the church. By means of the ascended Christ&rsquo;s heavenly transmission, we are made one with Him, and thus His Body is produced.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost all that Christ had passed through, obtained, and attained was transmitted from the third heaven to the church. If we would experience the Body, we must have a personal experience of the heavenly transmission. Many genuine Christians neither have the experience of the Body nor sense that they are in the Body, because they do not have the vision of the transmission that has taken place from the Head to the Body. They have not seen that whatever Christ is, possesses, and has accomplished have been transmitted to the Body.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is nothing of the natural man; the Body comes from the transmission of the ascended Christ. It is the transmission of the transcending Christ that issues in the church as the Body of Christ. Everything we speak in the church life, in the ministry, or in fellowship must issue from this transmission. If our speaking is of the transmission, then our speaking is of the Body. If it is not of the transmission, it is not of the Body. It is in the transmission that we have the church life and that the Body functions. By means of the heavenly transmission, the Body is real, genuine, living, and aggressive.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) The Fullness of Him Who Fills All in All</h2>
<p>It is in the transmission that the Body of Christ is the fullness of the One who fills all in all, because the Christ who fills all in all is in the transmission. The transmission connects us to the all-filling Christ. In this way the church becomes the fullness of the all-filling Christ.</p>
<p>The One who fills all in all is the unlimited, unsearchable, all-inclusive, and omnipresent Christ&mdash;the Christ whose dimensions are those of the universe (3:18). On the one hand, the phrase <em>all in all</em> in Ephesians 1:23 is similar to the phrase <em>all and in all</em> in Colossians 3:11. In Colossians 3, Christ is all the members who comprise the new man and is in all the members. In Ephesians 1, the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who is in all the believers and who is all the believers. Christ is the One who fills all the believers and is in all the believers, and the Body of Christ is the issue of such a filling.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Christ&rsquo;s filling all in all in Ephesians 1:23 surpasses His being all and in all in Colossians 3:11. Colossians 3:11 refers to the sphere of the new man, whereas Ephesians 1:23 refers not only to the Body of Christ but also the universe which includes time and space. Christ is not only all and in all with respect to the new man, but He fills all in all with respect to the universe. Christ is so universally vast that He fills all things. Universally, Christ is above all and fills all in all. The Body of Christ is the fullness of this great, universal Christ.</p>
<p>Christ today is the One who fills all things in the universe. This universal Christ, the Christ who fills all things and who is both in the heavens and on the earth, needs a Body to be His fullness. When Jesus the Nazarene was on the earth, prior to His resurrection He as a man was not omnipresent, for He was a small man limited by His flesh. Yet He descended into the lower parts of the earth, rose from the dead, and ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things (4:9-10). Now He can be in the heavens and on the earth simultaneously. Because He is such a One who fills all things, He needs a great Body as His fullness. The Body of Christ is His universal fullness. Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression.</p>
<p>The church as the Body of Christ is His fullness. The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ (3:8). Through the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s riches, we become His fullness to express Him. The fullness of Christ comes into being by our receiving the riches of Christ to be experienced and enjoyed by us and assimilated and constituted into our entire being.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">63. The Sphere and Element<br />
of the Creation of God&rsquo;s Masterpiece</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:5-10 reveals that Christ is the sphere and element of the creation of God&rsquo;s masterpiece, the believers as a corporate entity. This portion of the Word reveals that by the dispensing of His life into the believers, God in the Son has enlivened them together with Christ, raised them up together with Christ, and seated them together with Christ in the heavenlies, thereby creating them in Christ as His masterpiece in order that He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace of life. Christ is the means by which, the sphere in which, and the element with which God has enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies. Without Christ and outside of Christ, God has no way to enliven us, raise us up, and seat us in the heavenlies. God carried out these three matters through Christ as His channel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Having Made Us Alive Together with Christ<br />
for Our Salvation by Grace</h2>
<p>God has made us alive together with Christ for our salvation by grace. In Ephesians 2:5 Paul says, &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved).&rdquo; The salvation by grace here is not merely the salvation from God&rsquo;s judgment, condemnation, and the lake of fire; it is the salvation that saves us to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25), the salvation that saves us from anything that suppresses, oppresses, enslaves, or holds us back.</p>
<p>As sinners, we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness and justification, but as those who are dead in offenses and sins (Eph. 2:1), we need to be made alive. Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God&rsquo;s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas being made alive causes us, the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him. God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself (Col. 3:4), into our dead spirit through His Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God enlivened us together when He enlivened the crucified Jesus. Therefore, He made us alive together with Christ.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 2:5 Paul says, &ldquo;By grace you have been saved.&rdquo; Grace is free; here it denotes not only God freely dispensed into us for our enjoyment but also God&rsquo;s action in freely saving us. By such grace we have been saved out of our wretched position of death into the marvelous realm of life.</p>
<p>We were saved not only as sinners but also as dead persons, and not only by Christ&rsquo;s death with its redemption but also by His resurrection with its resurrection life, and even by His ascension with its transcendency. This is the transcending salvation given to the dead sinners by the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, the very embodiment of the processed Triune God. Such a salvation produces the church as the issue of the processed Divine Trinity for His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Having Raised Us Up Together<br />
and Seated Us Together in the Heavenlies<br />
for Our Salvation by Grace through Faith</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:6-8 we see that God has raised us up together with Christ and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies for our salvation by grace through faith. Verse 6 tells us that God &ldquo;raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; To make us alive is the initial step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life. After this, God raised us up from the position of death. The salvation spoken of in verse 5 is the resurrection in power. By this salvation God not only made us alive together with Christ but also raised us up together with Christ and seated us together with Him.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that according to verses 5 and 6 we were made alive together and raised up together. From our standpoint we have been raised up from our position of death one by one. Since there is no time element with God, in His eyes we were all raised up together at the same time that the apostles Peter, John, and Paul were raised up. In God&rsquo;s view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea (Exo. 14). According to the book of Exodus, the entire congregation of the children of Israel was saved at the same time, for they passed through the Red Sea together. In other words, the children of Israel came out of Egypt, crossing the Red Sea not one by one at different times but as a congregation at the same time. This is a clear type showing that we were all saved together; we were all made alive and raised up at the same time.</p>
<p>The initial step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life is to make us alive together with Christ (Eph. 2:5), the second step is to raise us up from the position of death (v. 6a), and the third step is to seat us together in the heavenlies. God not only raised us up from the position of death, but He also seated us in the highest place in the universe.</p>
<p>The heavenlies are the highest position, into which we have been saved in Christ. In the book of Romans, Christ as our righteousness brought us into a state in which we are acceptable to God. In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into a position in which we are above all God&rsquo;s enemies. Here in the heavenly atmosphere, with a heavenly nature and a heavenly characteristic, we are a heavenly people. God&rsquo;s salvation has transferred us into such a realm and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Although we are persons living and moving on the earth, we should see ourselves seated together with Christ in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. Since we are in the heavenlies in Christ, we are not under any person or problem; rather, we are far above all persons and problems. We soar above earthly things that bother the unbelievers. The earthly things cannot touch us, because we are transcendent. We are transcendent because we are people in the heavenlies in the organic union with Christ through His resurrection and ascension.</p>
<p>It was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies. This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it has been applied to us by the Spirit of Christ ever since we believed in Him. Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact.</p>
<p>Both Romans and Ephesians indicate that we are in Christ. In Romans, our transfer from Adam into Christ is primarily a matter of being placed into a justified position; in Ephesians, our being in Christ is not only a matter of a heavenly position but, even more importantly, a matter of life. Because we are in Christ, we have the vitality of life. In Romans, Christ is the righteousness of God, but in Ephesians, Christ is life. Therefore, according to Romans, to be in Christ means to be in a justified position; according to Ephesians, to be in Christ means to have the vitality of life.</p>
<p>In verse 7 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The church is produced in the present age; the ages which are coming are the ages of the millennium and eternity future. To display the riches of God&rsquo;s grace is to exhibit them to the whole universe publicly. The riches of God&rsquo;s grace surpass every limit. These are the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment. They will be publicly displayed for eternity.</p>
<p>Verse 7 says that the surpassing riches of God&rsquo;s grace are in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. Kindness is a benevolent goodness which issues out of mercy and love. It is in such kindness that the grace of God is given to us.</p>
<p>In verse 8 Paul continues, &ldquo;For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.&rdquo; The word <em>for</em> here introduces the reason that God displays His grace (v. 7). Because we have been saved by His grace, God can display it.</p>
<p>Grace is God dispensed into us. Therefore, to be saved by grace means to be saved by having the processed Triune God dispensed into us. Ephesians reveals that the saving grace is God Himself in Christ wrought into our being. According to this Epistle, salvation is the transmission of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us. When this person comes into us as grace, we are saved. Once we receive such a divine transmission, we are made alive, raised up, and seated with Christ in the heavenlies. God processed in Christ and transmitted into our being is the saving grace and the abounding grace.</p>
<p>This grace has surpassing riches. It has many aspects, virtues, and attributes, such as life, light, and power. Apart from life, light, and power, God cannot save us. In order to save us, God needed love and wisdom. These are some of the surpassing riches of God&rsquo;s saving grace. In His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, God has saved us by His grace. In the ages to come&mdash;in the millennium and eternity future&mdash;God will display this grace publicly to the whole universe.</p>
<p>In verse 8 Paul says that by grace we have been saved through faith. Faith is the substantiation of invisible things (Heb. 11:1). It is by faith that we substantiate all the things Christ has accomplished for us. Through such a substantiating ability, we have been saved by grace. The free action of God&rsquo;s grace saved us through our substantiating faith. This faith of ours is the faith by which we believe in Christ, and it is Christ in us as our faith. Our faith in Christ does not come out of us; rather, it comes out of Him. When we see Christ, faith is imparted into us. In ourselves, we do not have any faith. Before we were saved, we were utterly unable to believe, but on the day we were saved, faith, the believing ability, was imparted to us, and we believed. This faith is not of ourselves; it is part of grace transmitted into us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Making Us a Poem in His New Creation</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:10 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Here the Greek word for <em>masterpiece</em> is <em>poiema,</em> which means &ldquo;something that has been made, a handiwork,&rdquo; or &ldquo;something that has been written or composed as a poem.&rdquo; Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker&rsquo;s wisdom and design. We, the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are a poem expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design. In the universe nothing is more meaningful than the church, a poem written by God.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the angels and even in the eyes of Satan, we are a sweet, beautiful, and wise poem written by God. In Christ we are a poem that is so pleasant to God, though we may not feel this way. If we look at the believers from a human point of view, we may lament their deficiencies and shortcomings, feeling that they are pitiful persons. On the contrary, if we look at the believers from God&rsquo;s perspective, we will realize that they are the most pleasant persons and even much superior to the angels. Today we must believe the fact that in Christ Jesus we are the masterpiece of God. In eternity when we all are in the new creation, the New Jerusalem, we will realize that we are indeed God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His poem, as His new creation.</p>
<p>Writers, composers, and artists often attempt to achieve a masterpiece, an outstanding work. God has made many things, but none of them is as dear, precious, valuable, and desirable as the church. The heavens, the earth, and man, created by God, are not God&rsquo;s masterpiece, but the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23), the corporate and universal new man (2:15), is a masterpiece. As God&rsquo;s masterpiece, we are a matchless display of God&rsquo;s divine wisdom and a supreme handiwork of God, whose magnificent design cannot be improved upon.</p>
<p>Verse 10 says that we are God&rsquo;s masterpiece &ldquo;created in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We, the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, a new invention of God. We were created by God in Christ through regeneration to be His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). God&rsquo;s masterpiece is absolutely new because it is the mingling of God and man. God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His greatest workmanship, is the working of Himself into man and the constituting of man into oneness with Himself to produce a marvelous poem.</p>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His workmanship. This means that we should not think that we are able to work for God or do God&rsquo;s work. God does not expect us to work for Him. On the contrary, He is seeking the opportunity to work upon us. If we consider our situation, we will realize how much work remains to be done on us. God does not need us to work for Him. Rather, He will work on us until we become His masterpiece. The reason we are God&rsquo;s masterpiece is that Christ is being wrought into us. We can boast to God&rsquo;s creation that we have Christ in us. The more Christ is wrought into us, the more we become part of God&rsquo;s workmanship, God&rsquo;s masterpiece.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 3:10, God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom will be made known through the church. Hymns express the wisdom of the hymn writers. In the ages to come, in the millennium and in eternity, there will be a unique hymn, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the church, which expresses the wisdom and design of God. When we see the New Jerusalem, we may extol God for the beauty, wisdom, and design manifested in this marvelous production. The New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s poem, His masterpiece.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. For Good Works, Which God Prepared<br />
Beforehand That We Would Walk in Them</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:10 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them.&rdquo; The good works for which God created us are not the good things that are according to our general concept but the definite good doings that God preplanned and preordained for us to walk in. These good things must be the doing of His will that we may live the church life and bear the testimony of Jesus, as revealed in the succeeding chapters of Ephesians. We should not do things according to our will or intention; rather, we should do the things God prepared before the foundation of the world so that we would walk in them. Therefore, in Christ we have been saved by grace to be God&rsquo;s masterpiece that we may walk in the good works prepared beforehand by God.</p>
<p>Once we were not only sinners but also dead in offenses. However, through His great mercy God came to us in His grace, and by His divine life He enlivened us together with Christ, raised us up together with Him, and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies. Therefore, we have passed out of death into life and have been transferred from earth to heaven. In this position of resurrection and ascension, we no longer live in sin; rather, we walk in the good works which God has prepared beforehand for us. In this way God in His grace has worked on us to make us the divine, heavenly, and universal poem, God&rsquo;s masterpiece created in Christ Jesus.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">64. The Creator of the New Man</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:11-22 unveils that Christ is the Creator of the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. His Redemption Having Brought In<br />
the Alienated Gentiles</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:11-13 shows that according to our status, we, the Gentiles, were far off from God, Christ, God&rsquo;s kingdom, God&rsquo;s blessings, God&rsquo;s promise, and everything related to God. In particular, we, the alienated Gentiles, were separated from Israel, God&rsquo;s chosen people, but Christ&rsquo;s redemption brought us into God and Israel, making us one with God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 2:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands.&rdquo; This verse indicates that we were once the Gentiles in the flesh. The man whom God created to fulfill His purpose was pure, without sin or any kind of negative mixture. However, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into man through the fall. First, it caused man&rsquo;s body to become the flesh, full of lusts, and eventually, it made the whole being of man the flesh. Hence, man was damaged and was thus prevented from fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose. Then God came in to call a race&mdash;Abraham and his descendants&mdash;out of fallen mankind. For the accomplishing of His purpose, God commanded them to be circumcised, that is, to put away their flesh. This meant that they were separated from fallen mankind and delivered out of the fallen condition. Circumcision made a tremendous distinction between them and the rest of mankind. The circumcised people were called &ldquo;the circumcision,&rdquo; those who were separated from the fallen situation. The rest of mankind was called &ldquo;the uncircumcision,&rdquo; those who remained in the fallen state. These were the Gentiles in the flesh. We were in this category before we were in Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 12 says &ldquo;That you were at that time apart from Christ.&rdquo; Christ, in whom all God&rsquo;s blessings to His chosen people are embodied, came out of Israel, the circumcised people. Since we, the uncircumcised Gentiles, were separated from Israel, we were apart from Christ, having nothing to do with Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 12 also says that we were &ldquo;alienated from the commonwealth of Israel.&rdquo; <em>Commonwealth</em> here refers to the citizenship, the civil rights, of God&rsquo;s chosen people, such as God&rsquo;s ruling, blessing, and presence. Through the fall, mankind lost all the rights that God intended for man in His creation. God called Abraham and through circumcision brought His chosen people back to all these rights. We, as uncircumcised Gentiles, remained alienated from such rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, verse 12 tells us that as Gentiles in the flesh, we were strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. God is in Christ, He rules and moves in the commonwealth of Israel, and He bestows His blessings according to His covenants. When we were apart from Christ, the commonwealth of Israel, and the covenants of God&rsquo;s promise, we were without God; we did not have God as our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:13 goes on to say, &ldquo;But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ.&rdquo; Here <em>but now</em> is a precious phrase, indicating that now in Christ we have hope and that we also have God. Once we were far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God&rsquo;s promise. This equals being far off from God and all His blessings. But now in Christ, we who were once far off have been brought near to the things from which we were once far off. We were far off because we were fallen, but the redeeming blood of Christ brought us back (1:7; Col. 1:20). Hence, in His blood we have become near both to Israel and to God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Death Having Abolished<br />
the Law of the Commandments in Ordinances,<br />
Broken Down the Middle Wall of Partition,<br />
and Slain the Enmity to Create the Two<br />
in Himself into One New Man</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:14-15 indicates that Christ&rsquo;s death has abolished the law of commandments in ordinances, broken down the middle wall of partition, and slain the enmity to create the two in Himself into one new man. The problems between Israel, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and us, the alienated Gentiles, are attributed to three main ordinances of Judaism: the practice of circumcision, the observance of dietary regulations, and the keeping of the Sabbath. These ordinances were obstacles that kept the Gentiles from God&rsquo;s chosen people. Yet Christ annulled all these obstacles on the cross. When He was crucified, He brought all the ordinances to the cross; on the cross all these ordinances were crucified (Col. 2:14). In this way Christ broke down the middle wall of partition that consisted of the ordinances and thereby slew the enmity, which was created between the Jews and the Gentiles by the ordinances, in order to create the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man.</p>
<p>Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances. The middle wall of partition is the law of the commandments in ordinances, which was instituted because of man&rsquo;s flesh. This middle wall of partition, which is the distinction (made mainly by circumcision) between the circumcision and the uncircumcision, became the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles. Christ&rsquo;s slaying the enmity was the breaking down of the middle wall of partition and the abolishing of the ordinances that brought in discord between the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>
<p>The law of commandments in ordinances is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of the ritual commandments, composed principally of the practice of circumcision, the observance of dietary regulations, and the keeping of the Sabbath. These ordinances were the main &ldquo;columns&rdquo; of Judaism. The moral commandments will never be abolished, but the ritual commandments were in force only during a particular time dispensationally and are therefore not permanent.</p>
<p>Ordinances are rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division. Every person has his own way of living. We need to be careful not to make our way of living or worship an ordinance. To practice the proper church life, all ordinances should be repudiated and dropped.</p>
<p>Concerning our way of life, we must all learn not to have any ordinances. We must learn to hate the differences that divide people. The worldly people regard cultural differences as a mark of prestige, but in Christ we have all lost this prestige. Now our only prestige is Christ and the genuine oneness. If we are willing to let go of our cultural pride, it will be possible for the Lord to have the proper church life.</p>
<p>The breaking down of the middle wall of partition is for the new man. If we keep our differences, it will be impossible to have the church life as the new man. The basic ordinances&mdash;those regarding circumcision, dietary regulations, and the Sabbath&mdash;had been ordained by God but were abolished by Christ on the cross. If the basic ordinances have been abolished, how much more should minor ones be abolished also? We should not keep any ordinances, and we should not create new ones. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we must learn to drop all differences in order to enjoy the church life as the new man.</p>
<p>We need to pay careful attention to two phrases in verse 15: <em>in His flesh</em> and <em>in Himself.</em> In His flesh, Christ terminated all the negative things in the universe: Satan, sin, the flesh of fallen man, the world, the old creation represented by the old man, and the separating ordinances of the law (Heb. 2:14; Rom. 8:3; John 1:29; Gal. 5:24; John 12:31; Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:15). In Himself as the sphere, element, and essence, Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man. We should declare, &ldquo;First I was in Christ&rsquo;s flesh; now I am in Christ Himself. In His flesh I was terminated on the cross, but in Christ Himself I was created as part of the new man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ did not stop with the termination of the negative things. Death is the threshold of resurrection; it ushers us into resurrection. Although Christ in the flesh was crucified, this death brought Him into resurrection. In resurrection He is no longer in the flesh; rather, He is the wonderful Spirit. It was in His flesh that we, the old man, were terminated, but it is in the wonderful Spirit that we have been created into the one new man. When our old man and our old nature were crucified, the ordinances related to our fallen nature were slain. Then in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and in His wonderful Spirit, we were created into one new man.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which and the means by which the one new man was created. He is the very element of the new man, making God&rsquo;s divine nature one entity with humanity. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;in&rdquo; can also have an elemental significance, meaning also &ldquo;with,&rdquo; implying that the new man was created with Christ as its divine essence.</p>
<p>Christ created the one new man, the church, by working God&rsquo;s nature into humanity. The working of the divine nature into humanity was something new. Hence, it was a creating. In the old creation God did not work His nature into any of His creatures, not even into man. In the creating of the one new man, however, God&rsquo;s nature was wrought into man to make His divine nature one entity with humanity.</p>
<p>In the creating of the new man, first our natural man was crucified by Christ, and then through the crossing out of the old man, Christ imparted the divine element into us, causing us to become a new entity, a new invention of God (Rom. 6:6; 2 Cor. 5:17). The Jews and the Gentiles were separated to the uttermost by the separating ordinances, but both were created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, which is a corporate man, the church.</p>
<p>The church is not only the church of God, the Body of Christ (the fullness, the expression, of the all-filling One&mdash;Eph. 1:23), and the household or family, the house, the temple, and the dwelling place of God (2:19, 21-22). It is also the one new man, which is corporate and universal, created of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, and composed of all the believers, who, though they are many, are one new man in the universe.</p>
<p>God created man as a collective entity (Gen. 1:26), but the corporate man created by God was damaged through man&rsquo;s fall. Hence, there was the need for God to produce a new man. This was accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s abolishing in His flesh the ordinances and through His creating of the new man in Himself.</p><h2 class="head4">c. He Himself Having Become Our Peace</h2>
<p>Speaking of Christ, Ephesians 2:14 says, &ldquo;He Himself is our peace.&rdquo; The word <em>our</em> refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers. Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near both to God and to God&rsquo;s people. Christ, who accomplished full redemption for both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, making both the Jewish and Gentile believers one. Because of the fall of mankind and the calling of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption this separation has been removed. Now, in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness, both are one.</p>
<p>Verse 15 tells us that Christ made peace. By Christ&rsquo;s abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances, that is, His slaying the enmity, and by His creating the Jewish and the Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers. There is a real peace among all the believers in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Having Reconciled Both in One Body<br />
to God in One Spirit</h2>
<p>As the Creator of the new man, Christ has reconciled the Jews and the Gentiles in one Body to God in one Spirit. Verse 16 says that Christ &ldquo;might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross.&rdquo; <em>Both</em> in this verse refers to the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only the uncircumcised Gentiles but also the circumcised Jews needed to be reconciled to God through the redemption of Christ, accomplished on His cross.</p>
<p>Verse 16 indicates that the Jews and the Gentiles have been reconciled in one Body. This one Body, the church (1:23), is the one new man mentioned in the previous verse. It was in this one Body that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled to God through the cross. We, the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were reconciled not only <em>for</em> the Body of Christ but also <em>in</em> the Body of Christ. What a revelation here! We were reconciled to God; we were saved in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We usually regard reconciliation as an individual matter; we do not often think of corporate reconciliation. However, the proper and genuine reconciliation is in the Body. The Body is the instrument, the means, by which we were reconciled to God.</p>
<p>According to verse 16 of chapter 2, we were reconciled in one Body to God. Originally, we were without God and we had lost God (v. 12), but through the cross, with the blood of Christ, we have been brought back to God in the one Body. As long as we are in the Body, we are one with God, but if we are outside the Body, we are separated from Him.</p>
<p>In verse 18 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; Both the Jewish and the Gentile believers have access to the Father through Christ, who abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, broke down the middle wall of partition, slew the enmity to reconcile the Gentiles to the Jews, and shed His blood to redeem the Jews and the Gentiles to God. This access is constituted of Christ&rsquo;s cross and His blood (Heb. 10:19). On the one hand, the cross of Christ slew the enmity caused by the ordinances, which were instituted because of the flesh, and on the other hand, it redeemed us with the blood of Christ, which was shed upon it. It was through the cross that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled in one Body to God.</p>
<p>As Ephesians 2:18 indicates, our access unto the Father is in one Spirit. First, both the Jewish and the Gentile believers were reconciled in one Body to God (v. 16). That was a positional matter. Then they both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. This is experiential. In order to enjoy experientially what we possess positionally, we need to be in the Spirit. If we have the cross without the Spirit, we have the fact without the experience. Hence, the Spirit is crucial.</p>
<p>Positionally, we were reconciled to God; experientially, we have access unto the Father. To be reconciled to God is to be saved; to have access unto the Father is to enjoy God, who, as the source of life, regenerated us to be His sons. Here the trinity of the Godhead is implied. Through God the Son, who is the Accomplisher, the means, and in God the Spirit, who is the Executor, the application, we have access unto God the Father, who is the Originator, the source of our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. He Himself Becoming the Cornerstone<br />
of God&rsquo;s Dwelling Place in Our Spirit</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20-22 Paul says, &ldquo;Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ Himself becomes the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s dwelling place in our spirit.</p>
<p>The foundation of the church is Christ (1 Cor. 3:11). Because the mystery of Christ was revealed to the apostles (Eph. 3:4-5), the revelation they received is considered the foundation on which the church is built. This corresponds with the rock in Matthew 16:18, which is not only Christ but also the revelation concerning Christ, on which Christ will build His church. Therefore, the foundation of the apostles and prophets is the revelation they received for the building of the church.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20 Christ is referred to not as the foundation (Isa. 28:16) but as the cornerstone, because the main concern here is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers, and the other, the Gentile believers. Here, not Christ but the apostles and prophets who received the revelation concerning Christ are stressed as the foundation. When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone (Acts 4:11; 1 Pet. 2:7), the One who would join the Gentiles to them for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In Matthew 21 the Lord Jesus indicated, in a figurative way, that the Pharisees would reject Him. Verse 42 says, &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures, &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes&rsquo;?&rdquo; By this word the Lord revealed that after His resurrection He would become the cornerstone to join the Jews and the Gentiles. Referring to Christ, Peter said to the religionists in Acts 4:11 and 12, &ldquo;This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner. And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s word shows that salvation implies building. God&rsquo;s intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens. Rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building. Many unbelieving Jews despise the Lord Jesus because they do not want to be joined to the Gentiles. As long as a Jew does not believe in Christ, he may be separated from the Gentiles, but as soon as such a Jew believes in Him, he is joined by Christ, the cornerstone, to the Gentile believers. Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined together in Christ for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 2:21, in Christ, who is the cornerstone, all the building, including both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is fitted together and is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. Here being fitted together is to be made suitable for the condition and situation of the building (4:16). Moreover, since the building is living (1 Pet. 2:5), it is growing. It grows into a holy temple. The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the believers&rsquo; growth in life. The entire building of God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s sanctuary, is in Christ the Lord. Such a building has the wonderful Christ as the joining cornerstone.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; The spirit here refers to the believers&rsquo; human spirit, which is indwelt by God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit. God&rsquo;s Spirit is the Dweller, not the dwelling place. The dwelling place is the believers&rsquo; spirit. God&rsquo;s Spirit dwells in our spirit. Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit. Verse 21 says that the holy temple is in the Lord, and this verse says that the dwelling place of God is in spirit. This indicates that for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the Lord is one with our spirit, and our spirit is one with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). Our spirit is where the building of the church, the dwelling place of God, takes place. This indicates that not only are the Lord Jesus and the Spirit of God in our spirit; the new man and God&rsquo;s dwelling place also are in our spirit. The church as the new man today is in our spirit. Practically speaking, when we are out of our spirit, we are out of the church. For this reason, we must always turn to our spirit, exercise our spirit, and walk according to our spirit. We should not be out of our spirit or have our being apart from our spirit. We must walk, live, act, and have our being in our spirit. When we exercise our spirit in this way, we are in the church.</p>
<p>By His all-inclusive and wonderful death, Christ created both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man. This one new man is not an organization but is an organism full of life. Through the cross He took away sin and sins, destroyed Satan, judged the world, abolished all the ritual laws contained in the ordinances, released His divine life into us, and created us into one new man as an organism constituted of the divine element by the dispensing of the divine life. Because Christ has abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, and because we all have the divine life, we are one. Now both Jews and Gentiles are reconciled in one Body to God through the cross.</p>
<p>Although very few believers today enjoy Christ as the Creator of the new man, we should enjoy Him as such. We may dislike certain nations and people therein, but if we enjoy Christ as the Creator of the new man, who brings us into oneness with all the believers in Him, we will be able to meet, fellowship, and pray with the believers from any nation. In Christ as the Creator of the new man, we can be one with all the believers, regardless of their race, nationality, or culture, for Christ abolished all the ordinances that separate us from one another. Hence, the church is composed of all peoples, irrespective of their race, nationality, and ordinances, as long as they have been redeemed by the blood of Christ and regenerated by the life of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">65. The Mystery of the Church</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:3-11 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the mystery of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Not Being Made Known to Man in Other Generations, but Revealed to the Apostles and Prophets<br />
in Their Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ as the mystery of the church was not made known to man in other generations but was revealed to the apostles and prophets in their spirit. In Ephesians 3:4-5 Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ, &ldquo;which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.&rdquo; This mystery is God&rsquo;s economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God&rsquo;s chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God&rsquo;s embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression.</p>
<p>According to verse 5, Christ as the mystery of the church was hidden in other generations but has been revealed in the New Testament age. In the New Testament we have the revelation, the unveiling, of God&rsquo;s economy. In other ages and generations this economy was a hidden mystery. It was not made known to Adam, to Abraham, to Moses, to David, or to Isaiah and the other prophets. God&rsquo;s economy, which is to dispense Himself into man in order to produce a Body for His Son, had not been revealed to them.</p>
<p>Christ, the Son of God, is the embodiment of God. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into a great number of human beings in order to produce a Body for this embodiment of Himself. This means that the Son of God as the embodiment of God requires a Body, an increase, an expansion. This expansion can be produced only by God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people. This is the greatest mystery in the universe. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people in order to produce the Body as the expansion of the Son of God for the full expression of God in the universe. Nothing is greater or more important than this.</p>
<p>This mystery was revealed to the apostles and prophets. <em>Apostles</em> in Greek means &ldquo;sent ones.&rdquo; The apostles are the ones sent by Christ, representing Him to carry out His commission in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The prophets are God&rsquo;s spokesmen, not primarily predicting the future but speaking for God and speaking forth God in the revelation of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says that the mystery was revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit. The word <em>spirit</em> here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God. It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit. Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is revealed to the apostles and prophets. We need the same kind of spirit to see such a revelation.</p>
<p>It is important to see that the hidden mystery is revealed to the apostles and prophets, not in their mind but in their mingled spirit. Our spirit is the organ in which God reveals His mystery to us. To see and to understand the mystery of Christ, our human mentality apart from our mingled spirit is altogether inadequate. If we remain in our mind, we will be unable to see God&rsquo;s revelation, but if we turn to our spirit, we will have the vision of God&rsquo;s mystery. The revelation of God&rsquo;s hidden mystery in Ephesians 3 can be seen only when we are in our spirit. This is the reason that the apostle Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation (1:17) so that we may understand the church, which is the mystery of Christ. In order to see the hidden mystery in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, we should exercise not only our eyes to read the Word and our mind to understand the Word but also our spirit to apprehend the Word. We need to open our being, be poor in spirit, and pray that the Lord would reveal to our spirit what is on His heart concerning the church.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to see the revelation of the hidden mystery, we must be strengthened into our inner man, our regenerated spirit, and allow Christ to make His home in our heart (3:17). Being strengthened into the inner man is the secret of seeing the revelation of the mystery.</p>
<p>We need to receive the same revelation given to the leading apostles and prophets. Paul could not receive this revelation for us; we must receive it ourselves personally and subjectively by being strengthened into our inner man. This revelation concerning Christ and the church is the economy of God, the hidden mystery. Whether or not we are today&rsquo;s apostles and prophets depends on whether or not we have seen the revelation. If we do not have the revelation, then we cannot be apostles and prophets. If we have the revelation of God&rsquo;s economy, we will be followers of the apostles and prophets in God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry.</p><h2 class="head4">b. That the Gentiles Are to Be Fellow Heirs,<br />
Fellow Members of the Body, and Fellow Partakers<br />
of the Promise in Him through the Gospel</h2>
<p>Regarding Christ as the mystery of the church, verse 6 says that &ldquo;in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel.&rdquo; The expression <em>fellow heirs</em> indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy the chosen, redeemed, and regenerated Gentiles and the believing Jews are fellow heirs of God, inheriting God. The phrase <em>fellow members of the Body</em> indicates that the saved Gentiles and the saved Jews are fellow members of the one Body of Christ as His unique expression. The words <em>fellow partakers</em> indicate that the Gentile believers and the Jewish believers are fellow partakers of God&rsquo;s promise given in the Old Testament, concerning all the blessings of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Being fellow heirs is related to the blessing of the household of God; being fellow members of the Body, to the blessing of the Body of Christ; and being fellow partakers of the promise, to the blessing of the promise of God, such as in Genesis 3:15; 12:3; 22:18; 28:14; and Isaiah 9:6. Both the blessing of God&rsquo;s household and the blessing of Christ&rsquo;s Body are particular, whereas the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise is general, all-inclusive.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. With His Unsearchable Riches</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3 Paul tells us that the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ for the church has been given to the apostles and prophets. Paul&rsquo;s revelation of Christ was mainly a revelation of Christ&rsquo;s unsearchable riches. According to verse 8, Paul announced the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness, what He has for us, and what He accomplished, attained, and obtained for us. These riches of Christ are unsearchable and untraceable.</p>
<p>The unsearchable riches of Christ are the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). How all-inclusive and extensive these riches are! The fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>The riches of Christ also include both human virtues and divine attributes. Christ is the real love, patience, and forgiveness. Apart from Christ we cannot love, be patient, or forgive, but when we have Christ, we have the uplifted human virtues and also certain of the divine attributes.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s riches are vast and inexhaustible. In the Scriptures these riches are depicted in types, such as light, the sun, the morning star, the vine, the apple tree, the cedar, the cypress, the Passover, wheat, barley, the henna flower, Adam, Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Aaron, and Moses. Beneath the surface of the Bible are all the riches of Christ seen in the types. Because these riches are so vast, it is difficult for anyone to say how many types of Christ there are. Just this one matter of the types reveals many of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s riches are also portrayed in shadows, figures, prophecies, and in the fulfillment of prophecies. In the Bible the first prophecy concerning Christ is Genesis 3:15, a verse which predicts that Christ as the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, Satan. This implies that Christ had to become a man born of a virgin, for He was to be the seed of woman. This one verse reveals much of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>All the riches of Christ are for the producing of the church. The church is produced not by teaching or by organizing but by the dispensing of Christ into us. The riches of Christ produce the church through our experience and enjoyment of Christ. On Christ&rsquo;s side, it is a matter of dispensing, but on our side, it is a matter of experience and enjoyment. When we experience and enjoy Christ who is dispensed into us, we become part of the proper church life. As the riches of Christ are dispensed into us, we need to digest and assimilate them. By absorbing Christ&rsquo;s riches in this way, we become His Body as His fullness to express Him (Eph. 1:22-23). Therefore, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ enjoyed and assimilated by us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. To Enlighten All That They May See<br />
What Is the Economy of the Mystery<br />
Hidden in God throughout the Ages</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s mystery is His hidden purpose, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the economy of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages, but now the New Testament believers, having been enlightened, are able to see it.</p>
<p>In verse 9 the English word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which denotes a household administration, or arrangement. This means that God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s household management, God&rsquo;s household administrative arrangement, the divine plan. In this economy, which is eternal and of God, a mystery was hidden. A mystery, a mysterious story, was hidden in the eternal God and in His eternal economy. This mystery, this mysterious story, is the church.</p><h2 class="head4">e. In Order to Make God&rsquo;s Multifarious Wisdom<br />
Known to the Rulers and Authorities in the Heavenlies through the Church</h2>
<p>Verse 10 continues, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s wisdom is manifold; it has many aspects and many directions. This wisdom is expressed to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, mainly to the evil powers of Satan. God desires to demonstrate to the powers of Satan how wise He is. Thus, the riches of Christ display His wisdom in a multifarious way.</p>
<p>According to verse 10, it is through the church that God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. As revealed in verse 8, the church is produced from the unsearchable riches of Christ. When God&rsquo;s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, they are constituted with those riches to be the church, through which God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God&rsquo;s wise exhibition of all that Christ is.</p>
<p>The church as the Body of Christ is composed of those who once were ruined, corrupted, and damaged. Before we were saved, we were dead in trespasses and sins, and we were scattered and divided, utterly unable to be one. We all were in a hopeless situation. Nevertheless, in His wisdom God is able to make us the church. Now we are not only redeemed, saved, cleansed, freed, liberated, and regenerated&mdash;we are one with God and with one another. Therefore, we are the church.</p>
<p>The church is God&rsquo;s greatest boast. God cares very much for the church. In His wisdom God has taken the people whom Satan ruined and has made them into the church. After God had created man and had put him into the garden, Satan intervened, convinced that the best way to ruin the man created by God for Himself was to inject his own evil nature into him. At the time of man&rsquo;s fall, Satan as sin entered into man and, in many respects, caused man to be the same as he is. For this reason the Bible refers to fallen men as the offspring of vipers (Matt. 3:7; 12:34). Having come into man as sin, Satan has made himself one with man and has transmuted man&rsquo;s body into the flesh. But one day God became flesh (John 1:14). Eventually, Satan caused this One who had become flesh to be crucified. First, Satan instigated Judas to betray the Lord Jesus, and then he stirred up the Jews and the Gentiles to cooperate in crucifying Him. What Satan did not realize, however, was that in putting this One on the cross, he was actually crucifying himself. As Hebrews 2:14 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo; Through His own death on the cross, the Lord Jesus destroyed Satan. This is a display of God&rsquo;s marvelous wisdom.</p>
<p>Even the rebellion of Satan is within the realm of God&rsquo;s wisdom. If it were not for Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God&rsquo;s wisdom could not be made known in a full way. Satan has created many opportunities for God&rsquo;s wisdom to be manifested in a multifarious way, that is, in various ways and aspects and from many angles.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s wisdom is exhibited in His redemption of fallen man. God foreknew that His enemy would rebel against Him, and He was prepared to face that situation. God also foreknew that the man created in His image for His purpose would be induced by Satan to sin, and He was also prepared to face that situation. Seemingly, the fall of man presented a great problem to God. However, this simply afforded Him an opportunity to express His wisdom in His redemption.</p>
<p>Because man was poisoned by Satan and corrupted by sin, God not only redeemed man but also regenerated him with His life. God redeemed man so that He could regenerate him with the divine life. Now God is working continually to sanctify His regenerated people with His holy nature and to transform them with His element. The divine life is for regeneration, the holy nature is for sanctification, and the divine element is for transformation. Furthermore, God will conform His regenerated, sanctified, and transformed people to the image of His Son. Eventually, He will glorify them with Himself. Therefore, the divine life, the divine nature, the divine element, the divine being, and the divine glory will all be used to form fallen and corrupted man into a Body to express Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. How much wisdom is required for this!</p>
<p>No human words can tell the greatness of God&rsquo;s wisdom in redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Nevertheless, by His mercy and grace, in our spirit we can apprehend with all the saints such a marvelous wisdom. In our spirit we can realize that God uses all He is and has to produce His family so that He may have a Body prepared and formed for His Son to express the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God. Such a Body is prepared and formed through regeneration by the divine life, sanctification by the divine nature, transformation by the divine element, conformation by the divine being, and glorification by the divine glory.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is our wisdom with respect to righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. As our righteousness, Christ has dealt with our past, which was altogether unrighteous. For our present situation, Christ is our sanctification, and for the future, He is our redemption. One day our body will be redeemed, that is, transfigured (Rom. 8:23). For Christ to be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption requires much wisdom on God&rsquo;s part. Although Christ is our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future, He is also our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<p>In order to understand this adequately, we need to see the full scope of God&rsquo;s economy. After the creation and the fall of man, God became flesh through incarnation. Then the Lord Jesus went to the cross and there crucified the flesh. After passing through death and resurrection, He ascended into the heavens, then descended and entered into us as the life-giving Spirit in order to enliven our deadened spirit and to regenerate us. Having regenerated us, He now dwells in our spirit as life. In this life, the divine life, we have the law of life, the sense of life, and the fellowship of life. The Lord, however, is not only life to us; He is also the anointing within us. Furthermore, He is daily sealing us, saturating us, anointing us, and permeating us. As this takes place, we spontaneously live Him, and He becomes our righteousness. This is God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>Through the work of the Spirit of life, a change is taking place in our nature. It is a metabolic change, a change that sanctifies and transforms us. Thus, Christ is not only our righteousness but also our sanctification. Furthermore, we are daily being redeemed, and eventually we will be glorified. Christ is our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, not only in an objective way but in a very subjective way&mdash;in the way of mingling and changing us metabolically. All this is a testimony to God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom. Many aspects of God&rsquo;s wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Our experience of Christ in these matters is according to God&rsquo;s manifold wisdom.</p>
<p>Because of His wisdom God can boast to Satan of what He has done with the man Satan corrupted and ruined. Have you ever realized that what we are as believers today is of God&rsquo;s wisdom? Only God has the wisdom to initiate such a wonderful thing, to make sinful and corrupted people the members of Christ.</p>
<p>The church through which God&rsquo;s wisdom is so marvelously displayed is God&rsquo;s masterpiece. In the eyes of God the most wonderful thing in the universe is the church, for through the church God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom is made known to Satan and his angels. The day is coming when Satan and his angels will be put to shame. They will realize that everything they have done has given God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. According to the Eternal Purpose, the Eternal Plan,<br />
Which God Made in Christ Jesus</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:11 goes on to say, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The eternal purpose is the purpose of eternity, the purpose of the ages, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past. It was made in Christ with a threefold intention: for God&rsquo;s glory, for the blessing of God&rsquo;s chosen people, and for the shame of God&rsquo;s enemy. The main intention of God&rsquo;s purpose is to glorify God, to express Him through His chosen people. This is the greatest blessing to us. In this, God&rsquo;s enemy is shamed to the uttermost.</p>
<p>God made His eternal plan, His eternal economy, in Christ. The Christ revealed in the Bible is the embodiment of the Triune God and all the processes through which He has passed, including incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension. In such a Christ, God made His eternal economy. Christ, therefore, is the center, circumference, element, sphere, means, goal, and aim of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s economy. In fact, all the contents of the eternal economy are simply Christ.</p>
<p>In brief, we all should believe that in Christ we are the fellow heirs of God, fellow members of the Body, and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel with His unsearchable riches in order to enlighten all that they may see what is the economy of the mystery hidden in God throughout the ages, which is the mystery of the church as the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">66. The Settler in the Hearts of the Saints</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:14-21 Christ is revealed as the Settler in the hearts of the saints. In this passage Paul prays that God the Father would strengthen us according to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith, that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the universal dimensions of Christ and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. Following this prayer, Paul praises God: To God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. By the Father&rsquo;s Strengthening according to<br />
the Riches of His Glory with Power through His Spirit into the Inner Man of the Saints</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:14-16 records Paul&rsquo;s prayer to the Father for the believers in Ephesus: &ldquo;He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; The apostle&rsquo;s prayer in 1:15-23 is that the saints would receive revelation concerning the church. Here in 3:14-21 his prayer is that the saints would experience Christ for the church. This requires us to be strengthened into our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) According to the Riches of His Glory</h2>
<p>In verse 16 the word <em>strengthened</em> is modified by four phrases: <em>according to the riches of His glory, with power, through His Spirit,</em> and <em>into the inner man</em>. First, we are strengthened according to the riches of the Father&rsquo;s glory. Glory is the expression of God. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; There is glory in the Son&rsquo;s declaration of God, for the declaration of God is the manifestation of God, which is glory. When the Lord Jesus expressed God on earth, God&rsquo;s glory was manifested.</p>
<p>All the families in the heavens and on earth express God to some extent. As they express God, there are the riches of His glory. The apostle prayed that the Gentile believers might experience God in a full way according to the riches of His glory, that He might be expressed through the Gentile believers by their experiencing Him in a full way.</p>
<p>What then are the riches of God&rsquo;s glory? The riches of glory in Ephesians 3:16 are related to every family in verse 15. Every family is an expression of God to a certain degree. Because the Father is the source, the origin, of every family in the heavens and on earth, every family is His expression. The family that expresses the Father the most is the family of the believers. Therefore, Paul prayed to the Father that we might be strengthened for the purpose of expressing Him to the uttermost.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) With Power</h2>
<p>We are strengthened also with power. This power is the power that is referred to in 1:19-22 and that raised Christ from the dead, seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet, and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Such power operates in us (3:20), and with such power God strengthens us for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) Through His Spirit</h2>
<p>It is through the Spirit that the Father strengthens us. He strengthens us by the indwelling Spirit. This does not mean that the Spirit is not with us or that the Spirit will come down from the heavens to strengthen us. The strengthening Spirit has been with us since He regenerated us. He is still within us. Through this indwelling Spirit, the Father strengthens us from within.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) Into the Inner Man of the Saints</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:16 also says that we are strengthened into the inner man. The inner man is our regenerated spirit with God&rsquo;s life as its life. It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), indwelt by the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:11, 16), and mingled with the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 6:17). In order that we may experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened into the inner man. This implies that we need to be strengthened into our spirit through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to remain in the spirit. We are accustomed to going out from the spirit, not to going into the spirit and staying there. According to our experience, we can testify that we are not inclined to stay in the spirit. Because it is so easy for us to get out of the spirit, we need to learn to remain in the spirit. Whenever we stay in the spirit, we are strengthened, but whenever we go out from the spirit, we are weakened. This is the reason we need the Father to strengthen us into our inner man so that we may remain in our spirit. The more we are strengthened, the more the parts of our inner being are brought back into the spirit, into our inner man.</p>
<p>We need to be strengthened in order to stay in our spirit and not be distracted by thoughts regarding so many things. In order to pray without being distracted, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. Oh, how we need to be strengthened so that our whole being may come back to the inner man and stay there! We need to be strengthened so that our whole being may be brought back to our spirit.</p>
<p>We all need to follow Paul in being strengthened into our inner man. When Paul bowed his knees to the Father, he was so strong in his inner man that nothing could shake him or disturb him. Because his whole being was in his spirit, nothing outward could trouble him. We also need to be strengthened to such an extent that nothing will be able to carry us away from our inner man. We need to practice praying to the Father that He would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man. We should experience the Father&rsquo;s strengthening us into our inner man every day by spending time with the Lord in prayer.</p>
<p>In Ephesians Paul tells us that our inner man needs to be strengthened and that we need to pray at every time in spirit (3:16; 6:18). The secret we need to learn is to exercise our spirit constantly so that our spirit can be strengthened. If we learn to exercise our spirit constantly, we will live not in the old man but in the new man, and we will live not in the outer man but in the inner man. The way to exercise our spirit constantly is to pray and contact the Lord unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Others may not see that we are praying, but in fact we are praying because at all times and in all things we are exercising our spirit to contact God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. That He May Make His Home<br />
in the Saints&rsquo; Hearts through Faith</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 indicates that the result of the Father&rsquo;s strengthening us into our inner man is that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith. Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will&mdash;plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit (Heb. 4:12; Acts 11:23; John 16:6, 22; Heb. 10:22). These are the inward parts of our being. Through regeneration, Christ came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). After this, we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our heart. Since our heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being, when Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself.</p>
<p>The expression <em>make His home</em> is a translation of the Greek word <em>katoikeo,</em> which means to settle down in a dwelling, or to make a dwelling place. The prefix of this word, <em>kata,</em> means &ldquo;down.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ desires to make His home downward in our heart. Christ is not only in us (Col. 1:27); He is also making His home deep down in our heart.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:17 Paul says that it is through faith that Christ makes His home in our hearts. Faith is the substantiation of things not seen (Heb. 11:1). Christ&rsquo;s indwelling is mysterious and abstract. We realize it not by our physical senses but by the sense of faith.</p>
<p>We need Christ to make His home in our hearts so that we may be wholly occupied and possessed by Him. When we were saved, Christ came into our spirit. Now we must give Him the opportunity to spread Himself throughout all the parts of our inner being. As we are strengthened into the inner man, the door is opened for Christ to spread in us, to spread from our spirit to every part of our mind, emotion, and will. The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us. This means that He occupies every part of our inner being, possessing all these parts and saturating them with Himself. As a result, we are filled with Christ.</p>
<p>Christ desires to make His home in our heart, that is, to occupy every part of our heart, our inner being. Yet He is now imprisoned in our spirit because our mind is set on other things and our conscience is not exercised. Because Christ is imprisoned in our spirit, we need to repent by turning our mind from other things to Him. When we repent in this way, our conscience will be exercised to bear witness concerning where we are wrong and what we specifically need to confess. By repentance we turn our mind to the Lord, and by confession we exercise our conscience. It is by repentance and confession that the two main parts of our heart, our mind and our conscience, are opened for the Lord. When we repent and confess in this way, our emotion follows with love for the Lord, and our will also chooses to seek the Lord. Consequently, our entire heart, as the gateway to our spirit, is opened for Christ to fill and strengthen our spirit. When our spirit is strengthened, Christ will increasingly make His home in all the parts of our heart. As a result, He will spread Himself from our spirit into our heart to make His home in our heart so that our whole inner being will be His dwelling place and His home.</p>
<p>When we exercise our spirit so that our spirit is strengthened through the Spirit, we will automatically forget about our self, reject our self, and thereby put off the old man. Spontaneously, Christ will have the opportunity and the full ground to take possession of our entire inner being. When Christ makes His home in our heart in this way, He takes over our whole inner being. Christ then becomes the Host of our heart and not merely a Guest. We need to allow Christ to make His home within us so that our heart, our inner being, will be His residence.</p>
<p>Christ is not simply dwelling within us; He is seeking the opportunity to make His home in our heart. This is to mingle Himself with every part of our being. Christ, the Son of God and the embodiment of the Triune God, is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit to spread into all of our inward parts. The result of this is not only holiness, spirituality, and victory but the marvelous mingling of divinity with humanity to produce the church.</p>
<p>In order for Christ to make His home in our heart, we need to take Him not only as our life but also as our person. Because the church is not only the Body with Christ as life but also the new man with Christ as the person, Paul in Ephesians 3:17 emphasizes the importance of Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our heart. Paul prayed that the believers would take Christ as their person by allowing Him to make His home in their heart. When Christ is in our spirit, He is our life, but when Christ spreads into our heart, He becomes our person. We need to take Christ not only as life in our spirit but also as the person in our heart.</p>
<p>If we take Christ as our person, allowing Him to spread into our heart, the person living in our heart will not be the self but Christ (Gal. 2:20). In a practical way our heart needs to become Christ&rsquo;s home. He must be able to live in us and to settle down in us. He, not the self, must be the One who occupies our heart. The crucial question is who is living in our heart and who is the person taking up residence in our heart. As long as we are still the person living in our heart, our heart is the home of the self, not the home of Christ. For this reason, we need to pray for ourselves and for others to have the reality of taking Christ as our person in our daily living. Everything we do should be done not by the self but by Christ. His tastes and preferences need to become ours. Then Christ will be not only our life but also our person. The Lord will thus expand in our heart, take possession of our heart, and make His home in our heart in a full way. Eventually, He will saturate our whole being with Himself, and we will live no longer by the self but by Christ.</p>
<p>The genuine church life is the issue of Christ personally making His home in our heart to occupy every corner of our inner being. The content of the church is the Christ whom we take as our person, the Christ who is wrought into our being. In order for Christ&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18 concerning the building up of the church to be fulfilled, the church must enter into a state where many saints allow Christ to make His home in their heart, possessing, occupying, and saturating their entire inner being. The more Christ occupies our inner being, the more we will be able to be built up with others in the Body (Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16). The reality of the Body life is such an inner experience of the indwelling Christ. The Body of Christ is the consummation of our enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ and the consummation of the experience of the unlimited Christ making His home in our entire inward being. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate issue of Christ making His home in our heart.</p><h2 class="head5">1) That They May Be Strong to Apprehend<br />
with All the Saints His Dimensions<br />
and to Know His Knowledge-surpassing Love</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 3:18-19, the result of Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts is that we are full of strength to apprehend the dimensions of Christ&mdash;the breadth, length, height, and depth&mdash;and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. To apprehend the dimensions of Christ, we need all the saints, not individually but corporately. The breadth, length, height, and depth in verse 18 are the dimensions of Christ. In our experience of Christ, we first experience the breadth of what He is and then the length. This is horizontal. When we advance in Christ, we experience the height and depth of His riches. This is vertical. Our experience of Christ must become three-dimensional, like a cube, and must not be one-dimensional, like a line. In our experience of Christ we must go back and forth and up and down, that eventually our experience of Him may be a solid &ldquo;cube.&rdquo; When our experience is like this, we cannot fall or be broken.</p>
<p>We become strong not only to apprehend the dimensions of Christ but also to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. The love of Christ is Christ Himself. Just as Christ is immeasurable, so also is His love; hence, it is knowledge-surpassing. Yet, we can know it in our spirit by experiencing it. If we compare what we have thus far experienced of the immeasurable love of Christ to all that there is to experience, it is like comparing a raindrop to the ocean. Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) That They May Be Filled unto All the Fullness of God</h2>
<p>The result of apprehending the dimensions of Christ and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. Here the expression <em>the fullness of God</em> denotes the overflow of the riches of Christ that have been constituted into us. The fullness of God implies that the riches of all that God is have become His expression. When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches, but when the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness (John 1:16). All the fullness of God dwells in Christ (Col. 1:19; 2:9). Through His indwelling, Christ imparts the fullness of God into our being that we may be filled even unto the fullness of God to be the practical manifestation of the church, in which God may be glorified in His expression (Eph. 3:21).</p>
<p>Our Christ is unsearchable and immeasurable, and yet He is intimately making His home in our heart. Because all the fullness of God is in Him, He is the embodiment of God. Therefore, as He makes home in our heart, we are filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the fullness is the expression through the completeness of the riches. This is the reason that in verse 8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ and that in 1:23 and then in 4:13 he speaks of the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are all that Christ is and has and all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained. The fullness of Christ is the result and issue of our enjoyment of these riches. When the riches of Christ are assimilated into our being metabolically, they constitute us to be the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression. First, in 1:23 this expression is the fullness of Christ, and then in 3:19 it is the fullness of God, for the fullness of Christ, the embodiment of God, is the fullness of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Father (v. 14) answers and fulfills the apostle&rsquo;s prayer through the Spirit (v. 16) that Christ, the Son (v. 17), may make His home in our hearts. Thus we are filled unto the fullness of God&mdash;the Triune God. This is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God into our entire being. Paul&rsquo;s prayer regarding our becoming filled unto all the fullness of God will be ultimately fulfilled in the New Jerusalem as the fullness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) To God Being the Glory in the Church<br />
and in Christ in This Age and for Eternity</h2>
<p>Verses 20 and 21 say, &ldquo;But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; Verses 16 through 19 are the apostle&rsquo;s prayer. The word <em>but</em> makes verses 20 and 21 a doxology. In his prayer the apostle prayed that the Father would strengthen the saints according to the riches of His glory. This implies that the glory of God can be wrought into the saints. In the doxology he said, &ldquo;To Him be the glory&rdquo; (v. 21), implying that the glory of God, which has been wrought into the saints, returns to God. First, the glory of God is wrought into us; then it returns to God for His glorification. Isaac&rsquo;s wealth was first given to Rebekah for her beautification; then all the wealth came back to Isaac, with Rebekah, for his glorification (Gen. 24:47, 53, 61-67). The apostle prayed that God would strengthen the saints according to His glory, &ldquo;but&rdquo; eventually God&rsquo;s glory, after being wrought into them, returns to Him along with the strengthened saints. This is the way in which God is glorified in the church.</p>
<p>We are being strengthened into our inner man according to the riches of God&rsquo;s glory (v. 16). This glory comes to us with God and, after being worked into us, will return to God with us. By means of this two-way traffic the church, as the firstfruits in the universe (James 1:18), takes the lead to give glory to God. All the other families both in heaven and on earth will follow the church to glorify Him.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s glory is wrought into the church, and He is expressed in the church. Hence, to God is the glory in the church; that is, God is glorified in the church. Moreover, God is glorified not only in the church but also in Christ. The word <em>and</em> is used in Ephesians 3:21 to stress this point emphatically. In the church the sphere of God&rsquo;s glorification is narrow, being limited to the household of the faith, but in Christ the sphere is much broader because Christ is the Head of all the families in the heavens and on earth (1:22; 3:15). Hence, God&rsquo;s glorification in Christ is in the realm of all the families created by God, not only on earth but also in the heavens. This is in accord with <em>unto all the generations forever and ever,</em> which means for eternity. All the generations forever and ever constitute eternity. God&rsquo;s glorification in the church is mainly in this age, whereas God&rsquo;s glorification in Christ is for eternity.</p>
<p>In summary, we should experience and enjoy Christ not only as the Dweller in us but also as the Settler in our hearts. Through regeneration Christ has been revealed in our spirit. Christ is the hidden treasure in our spirit; He lives in our spirit. Yet Paul prayed that this Christ in our spirit would have an opportunity to make His home in our heart, that is, to make our heart His own home. Our heart is different from our spirit. The heart is composed of the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Our conscience is a main part of our spirit. Therefore, our spirit is within our heart; in fact, our spirit is the center of our heart. Christ has been revealed into the saints&rsquo; spirit, yet with a great many saints, Christ does not have any ground in their hearts. Yes, all believers have Christ in their spirit, but most of the believers do not have Christ wrought into various parts of their heart. This means that Christ still does not have a home in their heart. For this reason, Paul prayed that Christ, who is in our spirit, may have an opportunity to make His home in our heart; that is, Christ may spread Himself from our spirit into all the parts of our heart in order to make His home and be settled in our heart. For Christ to make His home in our heart means that we experience and enjoy Him to such an extent that He not only lives in our spirit but also occupies our entire heart. When Christ makes His home in our heart, we will apprehend with all the saints the unlimited dimensions of Christ, which are the dimensions of the universe, and we will know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. This results in our being filled unto all the fullness of God to be His expression.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">67. The Center of the Processed Triune God<br />
for the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:3-6 Christ is revealed as the center of the processed Triune God for the Body of Christ. &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; The Father as the source is in Christ the Lord, who is the embodiment of the Father (John 10:38; 14:10; 17:21); the Lord is the Spirit, who is the reality of the Lord; and the Spirit is in the Body. In the Triune God the Father is the source, the Lord is the course, the means, and the Spirit is the transmission. The source is in the course, the course is in the transmission, and the transmission is in the Body.</p>
<p>In exhorting us to safeguard the oneness, the apostle Paul points out seven things that form the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God. These seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; are of three groups. The first three form the first group, that of the Spirit with the Body as His expression. This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ. The next three form the second group, that of the Lord with faith and baptism that we may be joined to Him. The last of the seven forms the third group, the one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body&mdash;all the three of the Triune God&mdash;are related to the Body. The third of the Trinity is the first mentioned in Ephesians 4:4 through 6 because the main concern here is the Body, of which the Spirit is the essence and the life and life supply. The course is then traced back to the Son and to the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Lord to Whom the Believers Are Joined<br />
through Faith and Baptism</h2>
<p>In verse 5 Paul speaks of one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. This verse reveals Christ as the Lord to whom the believers are joined through faith and baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) One Lord</h2>
<p>It is significant that verse 5 does not say &ldquo;one Son&rdquo; but &ldquo;one Lord.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John it is the Son into whom we believe (John 3:16), but in the Acts it is the Lord into whom we believe (Acts 16:31). In the Epistles of John, the Son is for the imparting of life (1 John 5:12), whereas in the Acts, the Lord, after His ascension, is for the exercising of authority (Acts 2:36), a matter which concerns His headship. Hence, our believing in Him is related to both life and authority, for He is both our life and our Head. As the Head of the Body (Eph. 1:22), He is the Lord. Christians are divided because they neglect the Head; that is, they neglect the Lord&rsquo;s headship and authority.</p>
<p><em>One Lord</em> in Ephesians 4:5 refers to the Son in the Divine Trinity. Christ came to be our life (John 10:10), and He as our life became the element within us, that is, the element of the Body of Christ. Formerly, we were all in Adam, and our element was the element of Adam, the element of death. When we believed and were baptized, we were severed from Adam and were united with Christ. Consequently, we the believers have within us another life, a new element, that is, Christ as our life and our element. Hence, Christ the Lord is the element of the Body; He is the element that constitutes us to be the Body of Christ. From Christ as the element of the Body of Christ comes the Spirit as the essence and reality of the Body.</p>
<p>For us to be the genuine church as the organic Body of Christ, we must have the element of Christ. Although we have believed and been baptized, in actuality we may still remain in Adam and have Adam as the element instead of Christ. Therefore, in our daily living we must accept the operation of the cross that deals with our old man and natural life; we must let go of Adam and let Christ live in us. Only when we live by Christ and even live Christ will we be the genuine church as the Body of Christ, having Christ as our life and element.</p>
<p>Because Christ is the element of the Body of Christ, the living of the Body of Christ takes Christ as the Head, life, content, principal object, center, and goal (Eph. 5:23; Col. 3:4a, 11b; 1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 1:23; Phil. 3:14). Because Christ is all these things, we, the members of the Body, should take Christ as our Head, our life, our content, our principal object, our center, and our goal. Christ is the nature, the meaning, the expression, the capacity, and the function of the Body of Christ. When we take Christ as our Head, our life, our content, our principal object, our center, and our goal, we will give Him the opportunity to manifest the capacity and function of the Body within His nature. In particular, Christ is the center of the Triune God; the Body of such a Christ certainly takes Him as its Head. We, the members of the Body, should all be under the authority of Christ as the Head of the Body.</p><h2 class="head5">2) One Faith and One Baptism</h2>
<p>Through faith we believe into the Lord (John 3:36), and through baptism we are baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3) and terminated in Adam (v. 4). Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ as the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head. Through faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<h2 class="head6">a) One Faith</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, faith denotes both the act of believing and the content of what we believe. Faith as our act of believing is personal and subjective, but faith as the content of what we believe is objective. The one faith in Ephesians 4:5 is not our personal act of believing; it is the object of our faith.</p>
<p>As Christians, we may differ concerning various doctrines, but we all have the one faith. We all believe in the person of the Lord Jesus and His redemptive work. We believe that Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our redemption, that He was resurrected on the third day, and that He has ascended into the heavens. This unique faith is held by all genuine Christians.</p>
<p>It is through this faith that we are joined to Christ. As soon as a person comes to believe in the person and work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, he is made one with Christ. Before this he was outside of Christ, but now he is in Christ. When we believe in Christ, we enter into an organic union with Him; in this life-union we are joined to Christ as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This Christ is our Lord, our Head, and we are under His authority. We are members of His Body, and He is our Head.</p>
<p>If we would keep the oneness, we must take care of both life and authority. The life-giving Spirit is working within us so that we may be transformed in soul, transfigured in body, and fully manifested as sons of God. This is a matter of life. But we have not only the life-giving Spirit within us but also the Lord as the Head of the Body. Hence, we must be submissive to the authority and headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head6">b) One Baptism</h2>
<p>The reality of baptism requires that we realize and confess that our natural being has been crucified and buried. Hence, baptism is the realization of death, burial, and resurrection. Through faith we are joined to Christ, and in Christ we are crucified, buried, and resurrected. Immediately after we believe in Christ, we should be baptized as a testimony of our realization of this fact. Baptism always follows faith. Through baptism, we have a complete and thorough transfer out of Adam and into Christ. Now we are in Christ who is our life and our Lord. No longer are we in Adam with Adam as our head. We are in Christ with Christ as our Head. Because the Lord, faith, and baptism are related in such a way, Paul spoke of them together in Ephesians 4:5.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, baptism has two aspects: termination and germination. We have been baptized into both the death of Christ and into Christ Himself (Rom. 6:3). Being baptized into Christ&rsquo;s death is termination, and being baptized into Christ is germination. By the one baptism, our history, our biography, in Adam is terminated. Baptism not only ended our history in Adam; baptism simultaneously ushered us into a new life. By the one faith and the one baptism, we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ. Because Christ is not divided, we who are in Christ are one. Because we are one in Christ, the Body of Christ is one. The Body of Christ cannot be divided because the Body of Christ is in Christ, who cannot be divided.</p>
<p>We must realize that both the faith that unites us with Christ and baptism that separates us from Adam are lifelong matters. In our daily life, when we appreciate the Lord, esteem Him, worship Him, and go along with Him, we sense that faith is within us, uniting us with Christ. Likewise, in our daily life baptism is our realization and application of the death of Christ, which separates us from all the negative things, such as the world, sin, the self, and the natural life. In 2 Corinthians 4:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Death operates in us, but life in you,&rdquo; and in verse 10 he speaks of &ldquo;the putting to death of Jesus.&rdquo; Both the death which operates in us and the putting to death of Jesus are the realization and application of the death of Christ in us, that is, our experience of baptism in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. With the Spirit and the Father<br />
for the Body Life of Oneness</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:3, 4, and 6 indicate that we the believers are joined to the Lord with the Spirit and the Father for the Body life of oneness.</p><h2 class="head5">1) One Body, One Spirit, and One Hope</h2>
<h2 class="head6">a) Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In verse 3 Paul says, &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&rdquo; The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself. To keep the oneness of the Spirit is to keep the life-giving Spirit. If we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness. If we stay in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<p>To walk worthily of God&rsquo;s calling, that is, to have the proper Body life, we first need to care for the oneness. This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ. Strictly speaking, oneness differs from unity. Unity is the state in which many people are united together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers, which makes them all one. This oneness is a person, Christ Himself, who is the Spirit dwelling within us. It is similar to the electricity flowing within many lamps, making them all one in the shining. In themselves, the lamps are separate, but in the electricity they are one.</p>
<p>Christ abolished on the cross all the differences that were due to ordinances. In so doing, He made peace for His Body. This peace should bind all believers together and should thus become the uniting bond. The uniting bond of peace is the issue of the working of the cross. When we remain on the cross, we have peace with others. This peace becomes the uniting bond in which we keep the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head6">b) One Body</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling.&rdquo; The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body. The reason we need to keep the oneness is that we are all one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head6">c) One Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit as the oneness of the Body of Christ is the essence of the Body. Without the Spirit, the Body is empty and has no life. The Body here is the Body of Christ, and the essence of the Body of Christ is the Spirit. Hence, the Body and the essence of the Body are one. It is impossible for the Body of Christ to have more than one essence. The unique essence of the Body is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the essence and substance of the Body. Therefore, the church as the Body of Christ must be essentially and substantially the Spirit Himself. If there is no Spirit, there is no Body; apart from the Spirit, all we have is a human congregation. Without the Spirit, there is no substance of the church; without the Spirit, the church is merely a social organization. The church must be one Body with the Spirit as its substance.</p>
<p>The Spirit is not only for the Body but also in the Body. The Spirit is in the Body, not just in individual members. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the one Spirit is not only the essence of the Body but also the life and the life supply of the Body. Without the one Spirit, the Body would be empty and lifeless.</p>
<p>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 12:13 indicates that one Spirit is wrought into us and constituted into our being in order that we may be constituted into one Body. The Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, and the one Spirit has been wrought into the being of the one Body. Eventually, because the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, we can say that the one Body is one with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit in Ephesians 4:4 refers to the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit who is within the Body and gives life to the Body. According to 1 Corinthians 12:13, the one Body came into existence through the baptism of this all-inclusive Spirit. Having been baptized in one Spirit, we must proceed to drink of this Spirit. This indicates that the existence of the Body depends on the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Furthermore, the Body continues to exist through our drinking of this Spirit. By our drinking the life-giving Spirit, our inward being becomes mingled with the one Spirit; this mingling of the Spirit as the processed Triune God with His chosen people as the members of the Body is the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>To build up the Body of Christ is to have the Spirit wrought into us and constituted into our being in order to saturate every part of our being, making us one with the Spirit. The Body is the constitution of the divine Spirit. This indicates that the one Body and the one Spirit are not two separate entities. Rather, the one Body is one with the Spirit, and the one Spirit is one with the Body. For this reason, there must be no division in the Body. Since the Spirit is one, there can be only one Body.</p>
<p>The Spirit as the essence of the Triune God has become the essence of the one Body. The essence of the Body of Christ is the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God (John 7:39; Rev. 22:17a). The essence of the Body of Christ, containing the divinity of the Triune God, has the capacity to supply the divine life (Phil. 1:19); the essence of the Body of Christ, containing the excelling humanity of Jesus, has the capacity to supply this excelling humanity (Acts 16:7); the essence of the Body of Christ, containing the all-inclusive death of Christ, has the capacity to put to death the negative things (Rom. 8:13); and the essence of the Body of Christ, containing the surpassing resurrection of Christ, has the surpassing capacity of resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>The Spirit as the reality of the Triune God is also the reality of the Body of Christ. The reality of the processed Triune God is the consummated Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6). The Spirit of reality makes everything of the processed Triune God a reality in the Body of Christ (John 16:13-15); the Spirit of reality makes all the riches of the Triune God real to the Body of Christ. Without the Spirit, there is no Body of Christ, no church.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the inward essence and the expressed reality of the Body of Christ. The Spirit is the secret to all that the Triune God is to the Body of Christ. This Spirit now dwells in our regenerated spirit and is joined to our spirit as the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:9-11; 1 Cor. 6:17). Therefore, we must turn to our spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and walk according to our spirit. When we live in the mingled spirit, we will be able to live out the Body of Christ and become His corporate expression.</p><h2 class="head6">d) One Hope</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:4 the one hope of glory (Col. 1:27) refers to the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21) and the manifestation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19, 23-25). As saved ones, we have the hope that one day the Lord Jesus will come as our hope of glory and that through Him our vile body will be transfigured (Phil. 3:21). On the one hand, we appreciate our bodies because they are useful and because without them we cannot exist in this world. On the other hand, our bodies are troublesome, for they are often weak and subject to illness. Therefore, we believers in Christ have the hope that one day our troublesome bodies will be metabolically transfigured by Christ to become glorified bodies.</p>
<p>We may find it difficult to believe that our vile bodies will be transfigured into glorious bodies. Consider the process a carnation seed undergoes to produce blossoms. In itself a carnation seed has no beauty, but by being sown into the soil and by growing normally, the seed is transfigured into a plant with beautiful blossoms. In speaking about the transfiguration of the body in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul compares our bodies to seeds (vv. 35-44). We have the solid hope that the day will come for the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; to blossom.</p>
<p>According to Romans 8, our hope also implies our manifestation as sons of God. We are sons of God today, but our sonship is hidden and even somewhat mysterious. For this reason, the worldly people treat us the same as everyone else, without any realization that we are sons of God. However, the time is coming when our sonship will be manifested. Then it will no longer be necessary to tell others that we are Christians. It will be apparent to all that we are sons of God in glory. The manifestation of the sons of God will also be the glorification of the sons of God. This is our hope.</p>
<p>Neither the transfiguration of our body nor our manifestation as the sons of God will merely be a sudden, unexpected occurrence. On the contrary, both our transfiguration and our manifestation are gradually taking place today. To be sure, there is a sense in which transfiguration and manifestation will take place suddenly. But according to the truth of the New Testament and according to our experience, transfiguration and manifestation are also a gradual process in which we are involved today. This process is being carried out by the one Spirit, who is the essence, the life, and the life supply of the Body of Christ. The Spirit is presently working within us to transfigure us and to manifest our sonship. This is the reason Paul linked the one hope and the one Spirit to the one Body.</p>
<p>As believers, we are members of the Body of Christ, and we need to be transfigured. Within us as members of the Body and within the Body as a whole, there is the one Spirit, who is the essence of the Body and the life and life supply of the Body. This Spirit is neither dormant nor idle; on the contrary, He is working energetically within us toward the goal of bringing us into the fulfillment of the hope of our calling. This is the reason that the transfiguration of the body will not be accidental. Today the indwelling Spirit is carrying out both the transfiguration of the body and the manifestation of the sons of God. Because we are in the process of transfiguration and manifestation, the rapture should not come as a surprise. Rather, it should be a normal experience.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 implies that the indwelling Spirit today is carrying out the process of bringing the Body of Christ into glory as the fulfillment of our hope. Therefore, in this verse we have the one Body, the one Spirit, and the one hope. Because we all are in the one Body with the one Spirit and have the one hope, we are one. There is no reason for us not to be one, and there is no cause to be different. We are one Body, and we have the one Spirit working within us to bring us to the goal of our hope.</p>
<p>The one hope of our calling is for the one Body. Only those who truly live in the Body with the one Spirit have this genuine hope. The hope of our calling is to be in glory, that is, to be in the divine inheritance in the New Jerusalem. The Body of Christ has the coming New Jerusalem as the genuine hope.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) One God and Father of All</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:6 Paul speaks of &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; God is the Originator of all things, and the Father is the source of life for the Body of Christ. The Trinity is implied even here. <em>Over all</em> refers mainly to the Father, <em>through all</em> to the Son, and <em>in all</em> to the Spirit. The Triune God eventually enters into us all by reaching us as the Spirit. The oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted of the Trinity of the Godhead&mdash;the Father as the source and origin being the Originator, the Son as the Lord and Head being the Accomplisher, and the Spirit as the life-giving Spirit being the Executor. The Triune God Himself, when realized and experienced by us in our daily life, is the fundamental basis and very foundation of our oneness.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:6 reveals that the divine dispensing of God the Father into the Body of Christ is in His being over all (as the begetting Father overshadowing us), in His being through all (as the Son caring for us), and in His being in all (as the Spirit living within us), enabling all the members of the Body of Christ to experience and enjoy the Triune God. This indicates that the Father who is over us, through us, and in us is triune; He is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>God being over all signifies His sovereign authority. We need to realize that God is over us, and we are all under Him. This means that He is sovereign over us and that He is the authority over us. Therefore, we must submit ourselves to His authority and must be under His sovereignty.</p>
<p>God being through all indicates that we should allow God to pass through our being. Most of the time, God cannot get through us because the avenues in our being are blocked to God; He does not have a free way in us. Hence, we must give God a thoroughfare in our being.</p>
<p>God being in all means that, as a result of our being under God&rsquo;s sovereignty and of our giving Him a thoroughfare, God can abide in us. In Ephesians 4:6 Paul unveils the God of the Body of Christ, the God who is over the Body, through the Body, and in the Body. Such a God is the subjective God for our daily existence. Therefore, day by day we must be under God, allowing Him to pass through us and giving Him the ground in our inner being so that He may abide in us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals four persons&mdash;one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God the Father&mdash;mingled together as one entity to be the organic Body of Christ. Because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all one with the Body of Christ, we may say that the Triune God and the Body are four-in-one. The church as the Body of Christ is a group of people who are united, mingled, and incorporated with the Triune God. This mysterious union, mingling, and incorporation of the Triune God with the Body of Christ are for the purpose of the divine dispensing of the Triune God into the believers. The Lord as the element of the Body is constantly dispensing His life into us, the Spirit as the essence of the Body is continually dispensing Himself into us, and the Father as the origin of the Body is gradually dispensing Himself into us, while He is over us, overshadowing us, while He is passing through us, caring for us, and while He is in us, remaining within us. The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of such a dispensing of the Triune God into the believers.</p>
<p>Out of the Father as the source there is the element, Christ the Son, and within Christ as the element is the essence, the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the element, the Spirit is the essence, and the Body is the constitution. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers. This mingling is the constitution of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The keeping of the oneness is a matter in the Triune God. Our oneness is the Triune God realized and experienced by us in our Christian life. In our experience, the Spirit is first because He is directly related to the oneness, to the carrying out of the oneness in the one Body. Following this, we have the Lord as the Accomplisher and the Father as the source. If we see this, nothing will be able to distract us or lead us astray. We will have the proper discernment regarding the oneness and how to keep it.</p>
<p>The oneness of the Body of Christ is actually the Triune God becoming our experience. Our oneness is the Triune God&mdash;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&mdash;wrought into the Body. Along with the Triune God, we have the faith, the baptism, and the hope. One day we received faith and were brought into Christ. What a glorious visitation was this coming of faith! After we believed into Christ, we were baptized. We became members of the Body with the hope of glorification. The oneness of the Body of Christ is the Triune God wrought into the Body, which comes into existence through faith and baptism and which has the hope of one day being glorified. May we all have the heart to care for this oneness.</p>
<p>The most crucial point in this message is that the Body of Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God. The Triune God is inseparable from and embodied in the Body of Christ. The expression in Ephesians 4:4 <em>one Body and one Spirit</em> indicates that the Spirit of the processed Triune God is inseparable from the Body of Christ. As the Body is one, so also the Spirit is one; as the Spirit is one, so also the Body is one. Where the Body is, the Spirit is. Hence, if we live and walk in our natural life and not in the Spirit, we are not the Body of Christ in reality, but if we live and walk in the Spirit, we are the Body of Christ in reality, for in the Spirit we are saved from everything natural. Verse 5, which speaks of &ldquo;one Lord, one faith, one baptism,&rdquo; indicates that through faith and baptism we have been brought into Christ the Lord; this means that Christ has become our constituent, that is, we have been constituted with Christ. Verse 6, which speaks of &ldquo;one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all,&rdquo; reveals the triune presence of the Father who is over all, through all, and in all; this indicates the full soaking, saturating, and mingling of God with man. Therefore, Ephesians 4:4-6 unveils that the processed Triune God is one entity with the Body of Christ and that the Body of Christ is not only the enlargement of Christ but also the embodiment and expression of the processed Triune God.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">68. The Giver of Gifts</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:7-16 Christ is presented to us as the Giver of gifts. In order for Christ to be constituted the Giver of gifts, He had to fill all things by passing through the highest and lowest places in the universe. In His incarnation and death, Christ descended from the highest place in the universe, heaven, to the lowest place in the universe, Hades; in His resurrection and ascension, He ascended from Hades to heaven. Through His descending and ascending, Christ became the One who fills all things. Through His descending and ascending, Christ passed through incarnation and crucifixion and entered into resurrection and ascension to conquer all the negative things in the universe such as sin and death. In particular, through His death Christ conquered God&rsquo;s enemy Satan, destroyed his power of darkness, and captured from Satan&rsquo;s hand God&rsquo;s chosen people, those who had been taken captive by Satan in his kingdom. Through His resurrection Christ imparted Himself into them as life, and in ascension He led these captives in His train of vanquished foes, His train of the triumphal procession. By His universal traffic, His victory over His enemy, and His triumphal procession He became qualified to be the Giver of gifts to His Body. Out of this triumphal procession, Christ made many captives as gifts to the church, His Body. Originally these captives were all God&rsquo;s chosen people. Yet through the fall they became the captives of God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. Through His descending and ascending, however, Christ defeated Satan and recaptured these captives of Satan, enlivened them with His resurrection life, and made them His captives in His triumphal procession, a procession celebrating His victory. Christ then gave them as gifts to the Body for its building up; these gifts include apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The One Who Has Descended<br />
into the Lower Parts of the Earth,<br />
Ascended Far above All the Heavens<br />
to Fill All Things, and<br />
Led Captive Those Taken Captive</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Ascended Christ Producing Gifts for the Body</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:8-10 we see that Christ is the One who descended into the lower parts of the earth, ascended far above all the heavens to fill all things, and led captive those taken captive. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;The Scripture says, &lsquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&rsquo;&rdquo; <em>Height</em> in the quotation from Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion (vv. 15-16), which symbolizes the third heaven, where God dwells (1 Kings 8:30). Psalm 68 implies that it was in the Ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the Ark had won the victory. Verse 1 of Psalm 68 is taken from Numbers 10:35. This indicates that the background of Psalm 68 is God&rsquo;s move in the tabernacle with the Ark as its center. Wherever the Ark, a type of Christ, went, the victory was won. Eventually, this Ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion. This portrays how Christ won the victory and ascended triumphantly to the heavens.</p>
<p><em>Those</em> in Ephesians 4:8 refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He conquered and overcame Satan, who had captured them by sin and death.</p>
<p>The Amplified New Testament renders &ldquo;He led captive those taken captive&rdquo; as &ldquo;He led a train of vanquished foes.&rdquo; <em>Vanquished foes</em> may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, again indicating Christ&rsquo;s victory over Satan, sin, and death. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory. Now Christ is celebrating His triumph over His vanquished foes and leading them as His captives in a triumphal procession in His move for His ministry to build up His Body.</p>
<p><em>Gifts</em> in verse 8 does not refer to the abilities or capacities for various services but to the gifted persons in verse 11&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. After conquering Satan and death and rescuing the sinners from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners themselves such gifts by means of His resurrection life and gave them to His Body for its building up.</p>
<p>In verses 9 and 10 Paul says, &ldquo;Now this, &lsquo;He ascended,&rsquo; what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.&rdquo; Christ has done a great deal of traveling in the universe. First, in His incarnation Christ descended from heaven to earth. Then, in His death He descended farther, from earth to Hades. Eventually, in His resurrection He ascended from Hades to earth, and in His ascension, from earth to heaven. Through such a journey He cut the way that He might fill all things.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Descending and Ascending Christ<br />
Constituting the Believers Gifts to the Body</h2>
<p>When Christ ascended up on high, to the third heaven, that was not the end of His traveling. After He ascended, He descended into our spirit. Therefore, Christ is the One who descends, ascends, travels, and comes to us in gracious visitations. Today Christ is still traveling; that is, He is still ascending and descending. However, now His traveling takes place mainly within us. In our experience we may be up or down. When we are down, Christ comes down to where we are and brings us up to God. Many times during the course of a day we may be brought by Christ into the heavens. From our experience we can testify that within us Christ descends and ascends; He goes up and down. Although He is always steady, He does not stand still. On the contrary, He does a great deal of traveling within us. It is difficult to say where Christ is. Is He in heaven or on earth? If we say that He is on earth, we may have the sense that He is in heaven. But if we say that He is in heaven, we may soon realize that He is on earth. Actually, Christ is everywhere. According to verses 9 and 10, He descended and ascended in order to fill all things. Do you think that Christ will fill all things in the universe without also filling you? Through His descending and ascending, Christ will fill us with Himself.</p>
<p>It is by His descending and ascending that Christ constitutes us gifts to the Body. The more He descends and ascends within us, the more we become gifts. Many believers have very little function in the church because they have not yet been constituted as gifts. They may be good believers, but they are not gifts to the church. But as Christ descends and ascends within them, He captures them, vanquishes them, and constitutes them into gifts to His Body. As a result of Christ&rsquo;s traveling, they become useful gifts.</p>
<p>Regrettably, however, within some of the saints Christ&rsquo;s traveling may have ceased. Christ no longer goes up and down within them. We need to be constituted as a gift to the church through Christ&rsquo;s descending and ascending within us. Christ should have many ups and downs within us. This means that Christ should go down and up within us; Christ should come down to where we are and should ascend with us into the heavenlies. If we try to hold Christ as the Head (Col. 2:19) without allowing Him to descend and ascend within us, we damage the process by which we are constituted gifts. The Lord will constitute us as gifts only through His descending and ascending within us. After such experiences of Christ&rsquo;s inward traveling over a period of time, we become useful in the church. We should experience and enjoy Him as a descending and ascending Christ.</p>
<p>Our Christ is the all-inclusive, universal Christ. He is far above all, and our Christ is continually descending and ascending within us. Through His descending and ascending, He fills all things&mdash;universally, vertically, and horizontally. We need to praise the Lord for His traveling, for the marvelous two-way traffic between heaven and earth and between earth and heaven. It is through such traffic that the gift-making and gift-giving Christ produces gifts for His Body. We should not focus our attention on ourselves but on the all-inclusive Christ. We should not consider how weak or how poor we are. Rather, we should think of Christ, speak of Christ, and look away to Christ. We need to praise the Lord for the revelation of Christ in God&rsquo;s economy found in the book of Ephesians! This book says little of Christ as the Redeemer or Savior. But it does reveal that Christ is far above all and that He is now filling all in all.</p>
<p>We should consider how the believers are constituted as gifts and presented to the Body. First, Christ is wrought into us to become our life, our person, and our everything. Then we minister to others the Christ who has been wrought into us. We need to see that only the ascended Christ can produce gifts for the Body. Notice that in Ephesians 4:8-11 the gifts are spoken of in relation to Christ&rsquo;s ascension. The ascension was the peak and the climax of Christ&rsquo;s work. The other basic steps of Christ&rsquo;s work are incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Ascension is related to the coming of the Spirit. After Christ had accomplished redemption through His crucifixion and after He had resurrected and ascended to the heavens, He came down as the life-giving Spirit. Through the crucifixion of Christ all the enemies were conquered. Hence, the cross is the center of Christ&rsquo;s victory. Furthermore, by His death on the cross Christ solved all the problems in the universe. This was the reason that after His crucifixion He could rest in the tomb and thereby enjoy a real Sabbath. Then in His resurrection He released all the divine riches. Following this, He ascended to the third heaven, and all the divine fullness was committed to Him along with all of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Saul of Tarsus was among these chosen ones given to the ascended Christ. It is important to be clear concerning Christ&rsquo;s descension as the Spirit after His ascension. According to Ephesians 2, Christ even came to preach the gospel of peace (v. 17). This indicates the coming of the ascended Christ.</p>
<p>When Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the churches, he did not realize that what he was persecuting was related to the heavens, that the church on earth was related to the ascended Christ. The Lord Jesus appeared to Saul of Tarsus, and spontaneously, even in his ignorance, Saul called upon His name, saying, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; (Acts 9:5). Because Saul opened himself to the Lord and called on Him, the Lord with the divine fullness could enter into him and then proceed to constitute him into a gift to the Body. In this way the one who persecuted the churches became one who could perfect the saints. Paul became such a gift, not through human education but by being saturated with the divine fullness. Therefore, Saul of Tarsus eventually became the apostle Paul who could feed the saints, preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, and minister Christ to his fellow believers so that they would be nourished, grow, be perfected, and come into their function.</p>
<p>If we would be perfected, what we need is not doctrine. Rather, we need to be constituted with Christ. Like Saul of Tarsus, we all were once enemies of Christ and persecutors of the churches. But one day the Lord Jesus came to us and captured us. The Lord Jesus came to us, and we were caught by Him. Now we need to take Him into us more and more until we are saturated with Him. In this way we shall become functioning members of the Body, gifts constituted by the Christ who has been crucified and resurrected and who has ascended and descended.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ephesians 4:8 reveals an important principle that it was only after Christ on the cross had defeated and captured God&rsquo;s chosen people that Christ led them to the heavens as His captives in His train of vanquished foes and made them gifts to His Body. We should apply this principle to ourselves; we should consider in our actual experience whether Christ has defeated us. Experientially speaking, if Christ has not defeated us, we cannot be led in His train of vanquished foes. Because Christ on the cross defeated all His enemies, He is victorious in the universe and has gained the ground to fill all things in the universe. But He may not be victorious in us and may not have ground in us, because we have not been subdued by Him in our experience. In order for us to function as a gift to the Body, we must be conquered and subdued by Christ. It is not until we become willing to be captured by Christ that He has the ground and standing to make us gifts to the Body. We must pray to the Lord from the depth of our being, &ldquo;I surrender to You. I am defeated by You. I am captured by You.&rdquo; We all need to be thoroughly defeated, captured, gained, and taken over by Christ. When we are willing to be subdued and captured by Christ, we will give Christ the ground to establish us as gifts to His Body. The more Christ ascends and descends within us, capturing and vanquishing us, the more He fills us with Himself to constitute us as gifts to His Body.</p>
<p>In order for the Lord to establish us as gifts to the Body, we must not only be captured by Christ but also grow in life. The more we grow in life, the more we will receive the life supply and the more this life supply will enable us to function in the Body. Holding to truth in love, we should grow up into Christ as the Head in all things (v. 15). By the growth in life, our function in the Body will be manifested. When we grow in life, we will have the rich flow of life, and this flow of life within us will be the function in the Body. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is to give us as gifts to the Body, yet for Him to make us as gifts to the Body, we must be fully captured, conquered, and possessed by Christ and grow up into Him as the Head in all things.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Giving Grace to Each of His Members<br />
according to the Measure of His Gift</h2>
<p>Verse 7 tells us that Christ gives grace to each of His members according to the measure of His gift. Concerning the Body of Christ, all the basic elements are one, but the gifts (the functions) are many and varied. Here grace was given according to the gift; in Romans 12:6 the gifts differ according to grace. Grace actually is the divine life that produces and supplies the gifts. In Romans 12 it is the grace that produces the gift. Hence, the gift is according to grace. Here the grace is according to the gift, according to the measure of the gift.</p>
<p>Each member of our physical body has a certain measure. The expression <em>the measure of the gift of Christ</em> refers to the size of a member of Christ&rsquo;s Body. With every member there is a certain size, a certain measure. Just as our blood supplies the members of our body according to their size, grace also is given to each member according to its size.</p>
<p>The measure of the gift of Christ is the size of a member of the Body of Christ. What kind of member you are depends upon how much of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ you have (v. 13). If you have a greater measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, you are a bigger member in the church. If a brother gives much ground to Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, he will have a greater measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The more of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ he has, the greater his function among the saints will be. The function and the size of a member are measured by the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>We also need to see that all the members of the Body are gifts to the Body. Although there is more blood in the shoulder than in the ear, the quality of the blood is the same. Just as blood is the life supply to our physical body, so grace is the life supply to the members in the Body of Christ. We should praise the Lord that all the saints are gifts of Christ to whom grace has been given. Just as every part of our physical body is indispensable, every member of the Body of Christ, great and small, is an indispensable gift to the Body (1 Cor. 12:14-22; Rom. 12:4-5). Therefore, we should never consider ourselves as too small to be a profitable gift to the Body. Rather, we should all declare that we are gifts to the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Giving Some Apostles, Some Prophets,<br />
Some Evangelists, and Some Shepherds and Teachers</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; <em>Each one</em> in verse 7 includes every member of the Body of Christ, each of whom has received a general gift; whereas the four kinds of gifted persons mentioned here are those who have been endued with a special gift.</p>
<p>The first of the four special gifts is the apostles. An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches. As long as anyone has the power to preach the gospel, the gift to teach the divine truth, and the ability to establish churches, he is qualified and confirmed to be an apostle sent by the Lord with His commission and authority. Throughout the ages, certain ones have been raised up by God to be apostles and have been given to the church as gifts.</p>
<p>The second category of special gifts to the church in Ephesians 4:11 is the prophets. The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God&rsquo;s revelation and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction. In order to be a prophet, one must have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. This means that a prophet must have the proper knowledge of the Word and also receive much divine revelation. Without this knowledge and this revelation, we cannot speak for God or speak God forth. A prophet must be one who has the light, the revelation, concerning what is written in the Word. The prophets, therefore, must have the spiritual gift to speak the word of wisdom so that God may be spoken forth and by this speaking be dispensed into others.</p>
<p>The third category of special gifts to the church in Ephesians 4:11 is the evangelists. The evangelists are experts in preaching the gospel, and all the saints need to learn of them. An outstanding example of an evangelist is Philip in Acts 8. Through his ministry and preaching of the gospel as recorded in this chapter, he was manifested to be an evangelist. Because he had an outstanding gift of gospel preaching, he was eventually called &ldquo;Philip the evangelist&rdquo; (21:8).</p>
<p>The fourth category of special gifts to the church in Ephesians 4:11 is the shepherd-teachers. According to the grammatical construction, <em>shepherds and teachers</em> refers to a single class of gifted persons. A shepherd should know how to teach, and a teacher should be able to shepherd. Shepherding needs teaching, and teaching needs shepherding. Therefore, shepherd-teachers are one category of persons. They shepherd others in order to teach them, and they teach others by shepherding them.</p>
<p>One crucial key to our becoming apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers is the word of God in the Bible. Day by day we must read the Bible and pray with the Bible in order to digest the word. The word of God will then enter into us and become the Spirit in us; with the Spirit, we will have life, understanding, and utterance. In this way we will be mingled with the divine word and the life-giving Spirit day after day. If our being is saturated not merely with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s word but with the living essence of God&rsquo;s word, we will surely be His apostle, His sent one. Furthermore, the extent to which we take the word into us and let it mingle with our inward parts determines the extent to which we can be God&rsquo;s prophet, His spokesman. When we become the embodiment of God&rsquo;s word, we will spontaneously become His sent ones, speak for Him, preach the gospel, and shepherd and teach others. If we are filled and saturated with God&rsquo;s living word, we will be God&rsquo;s apostles sent to the world, prophets to speak for Him, evangelists to preach the gospel, and shepherds and teachers to care for His people and teach them His economy. The matter of being a gifted person is wrapped up with being saturated with the word of God.</p><h2 class="head4">d. For the Perfecting of the Saints<br />
unto the Building Up of His Body</h2>
<p>Verse 12 tells us that the gifted ones were given to the Body &ldquo;for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; The many gifted persons in the preceding verse have only one ministry, that is, to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church. This is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy (2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:12).</p>
<p>According to the grammatical construction, the phrase <em>unto the building up of the Body of Christ</em> is in apposition to the phrase <em>unto the work of the ministry.</em> This indicates that both phrases refer to the same thing; hence, the work of the ministry is the building up of the Body. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry. The word <em>unto</em> in verse 12 means resulting in, for the purpose of, or with a view to. This means that the perfecting of the saints is for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ. Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of the ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ. However, this building up is not accomplished directly by the gifted ones but by the saints who have been perfected by the gifted ones.</p>
<p>The work of the ministry is both of the perfecting ones and the perfected ones; the building up of the Body is the work not only of the apostles and the other gifted ones but also of all the perfected saints. The unique work of building up the Body of Christ is the responsibility not mainly of the gifted ones but of all the saints. Both the gifted ones, including the leading apostles, and all the believers, including even the smallest member, work together to build up the Body.</p>
<p>The gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints. The gifted persons perfect the saints in the divine dispensing in order that all the saints may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ. The gifted persons perfect the saints by nourishing them according to the tree of life with the life supply for their growth in life (Gen. 2:9; 1 Cor. 3:2, 6). The gifted persons perfect the saints to do what they do for the direct building up of the Body of Christ. The apostles perfect the saints by visiting the churches (Acts 15:36, 40-41; 20:20, 31), by writing epistles to the churches (Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 1:2), and by assigning their co-workers to stay in certain places to perfect the saints (1 Tim. 1:3-4; 3:15; Titus 1:5). The prophets perfect the saints by teaching them to speak the Lord into people, by speaking in the meetings to set up a model, and by helping the saints to live a prophesying life by being revived every morning and overcoming every day (Acts 13:1; 1 Cor. 14:31; Prov. 4:18). The evangelists perfect the saints by stirring them up to be burning in the gospel-preaching spirit, by teaching them with gospel truths, by training them to preach the gospel, by helping the saints to be equipped with the power of the economical Spirit, and by setting an example of loving the sinners and praying for them (2 Tim. 4:5). The shepherd-teachers perfect the saints by shepherding&mdash;feeding and nourishing the young saints and teaching the growing saints (Acts 11:25-26; 13:1). The result of this perfecting is that we will all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13; cf. John 17:23). This perfecting will cause us to be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a satanic system of error (Eph. 4:14).</p>
<p>In order to be perfected, we must pay attention to life and to function. The way to be perfected is to grow in life and to become skillful in function. The Greek word rendered <em>perfecting</em> in verse 12 also means completing, equipping, and furnishing. To perfect a saint is to complete him, to equip him, and to furnish him. Only by growing in life can we be completed. Not until we become mature will we be completed. As long as, spiritually speaking, we remain under-age, we will not be complete. Mothers perfect their children by feeding them. Furthermore, parents equip their children and furnish them by training them to behave and to speak in a certain way. Thus, children are perfected by feeding and by training. The same is true with respect to perfecting the saints according to God&rsquo;s economy. The saints need to be fed so that they may grow in the divine life, and they need to be trained so that they may function with the proper skill. We should all pray, &ldquo;Lord, make me willing and ready to be perfected. I will receive the perfecting from the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should not think that as long as a person is spiritual in life, he requires no training. Rather, in spiritual things, as in physical things, there is the need of training. In spiritual things we need the maturity, the growth in life, and we also need the skill. The maturity comes from growth, and the skill comes from training. Therefore, in order to perfect the saints, we need to feed them with spiritual food that they may grow, and we also need to train them to develop certain skills.</p>
<p>All the saints should be building members. The gifted ones mentioned in verse 11 are not high officials with a special rank. Rather, they are given for the perfecting of the saints (v. 12). The saints need to be perfected, equipped, furnished, unto the work of the ministry. The perfecting or equipping is related both to growth in life and to training in certain skills. The work of the building up of the Body of Christ should be carried out not only by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers but by all the members. Hence, all the saints need to be building members. We should be not only members who have been built up but also members who build up the Body. First, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfect the saints. This means that they build up the saints. Then the perfected saints become the building members.</p>
<p>In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Here <em>joined</em> implies the thought of joining by fitting; <em>knit</em> implies the thought of interweaving. The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts. The expression <em>every joint</em> refers to the specially gifted persons, such as those mentioned in verse 11, and <em>the rich supply</em> must be the particular supply, the supply of Christ. Further, the expression <em>each one part</em> refers to every member of the Body. Every member of the Body of Christ has its own measure which works for the growth of the Body. The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body itself in love.</p>
<p>In brief, by His death Christ conquered all the enemies and solved all the problems. Through His resurrection He released all the divine riches, and through His ascension He received God&rsquo;s chosen people with the divine fullness. From the time of His ascension, Christ has been working to constitute the vanquished foes into gifts for His Body. First, He comes to these vanquished foes and enters into them. Then He gradually fills and saturates them with Himself. Eventually, those who were once His enemies are transformed and constituted into useful gifts that can be presented to the Body. These gifts not only teach others but also transfuse Christ into them. In this way the members of the Body receive nourishment and are cherished. Then they will be sanctified, purified, and transformed to become functioning members. As a result, the whole Body will be fitly framed together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the operation in the measure of every part. This will cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(47)</h1>
<p>Ephesians 1:1&mdash;4:16 presents profound and mysterious aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment, whereas the rest of the Epistle presents practical and fine aspects of Christ for our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head3">69. The Reality and Grace<br />
for the Living of the New Man</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:17-32 we see that Christ is the reality and grace for the living of the new man. In the Gospel of John, grace and reality are a pair. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality, and verse 17 says that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. This indicates that when God in Christ was incarnated as a man, He came with grace and reality; that is, when Christ came, grace and reality came with Him. Here we see that grace and reality are personified in Jesus Christ; grace and reality refer to a person, the Triune God incarnated and expressed in humanity.</p>
<p>Ephesians presents reality and grace as a pair for the living of the new man. Ephesians 2:15 tells us that Christ created the one new man; the new man is on the earth today. Ephesians 4:17-32 goes on to reveal that the way for the new man to live is by reality and grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Reality in Jesus for a Walk No Longer<br />
in the Vanity of the Mind</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:17-21 and 24, Paul presents the reality in Jesus for a walk that is no longer in the vanity of the mind.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Reality in Jesus</h2>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.&rdquo; Here Paul does not say that the reality is in Christ; rather, he says that the reality is in Jesus. The reason for this is that when the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man, in Him there was always the reality. In Jesus, that is, in His human living and His daily walk&mdash;whether He worked as a carpenter or carried out His ministry&mdash;there was the reality at all times. In order to understand the reality expressed in the living of Jesus as a man on earth, we need to read verse 17, where Paul exhorts the believers no longer to &ldquo;walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind.&rdquo; Here we see a contrast between the reality in Jesus and the vanity of the Gentiles&rsquo; mind. In the human living of Jesus there was no vanity but only the reality; however, in our godless society there is nothing but vanity of vanities. Using a phrase from John Bunyan&rsquo;s <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,</em> we may say that, as a whole, today&rsquo;s world is a &ldquo;vanity fair.&rdquo; Wealth, fame, position, entertainment, and material possessions in today&rsquo;s world are all vanities, but everything in the daily living of the man Jesus is the reality. Whatever He did in His human living is the reality; not one of His words was vain (cf. 1 Pet. 2:22).</p>
<p>Christ is not only life to us but also an example (John 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:21). In His life on earth He set up a pattern, as revealed in the Gospels. Then He was crucified and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us to be our life. We learn from Him (Matt. 11:29) according to His example, not by our natural life but by Him as our life in resurrection. To learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>The expression <em>the reality is in Jesus</em> refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity, but in the godly life of Jesus there is the reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with God. This is what is meant by <em>the reality is in Jesus.</em> We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus.</p>
<p>In His daily walk the man Jesus was not only great but also very fine. For example, when He fed five thousand men with five loaves and two fish, He was not so ecstatic over this miracle that He forgot the broken pieces which were left over after the people had eaten. Rather, He instructed His disciples to gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost, which amounted to twelve handbaskets full (John 6:12-13). The four Gospels reveal that in every detail of the Lord&rsquo;s daily living, there is no vanity but only the reality. Moreover, in nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see a striking contrast between the reality in the godly living of Jesus and the vanity in the living of others around Him, such as His opposers as well as His disciples.</p>
<p>In His thirty-three and a half years on earth, the Lord Jesus formed the mold, the pattern, to which all those who believe in Him are to be conformed. According to the record of the four Gospels, the life of the Lord Jesus was a life of reality. Reality is the shining of light. Light is the source, and reality is its expression. As Hebrews 1:3 says, the Lord Jesus is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory. This means that He is the shining of God who is light. Because in every aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s living on earth there was the shining of light, His life was a life of reality, a life of the shining of God Himself. That life of reality was the expression of God. For this reason Paul says that we learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus. In other words, we learn Christ according to the mold of the life of Jesus, which is the reality.</p>
<p>After Christ established this mold, He passed through death and resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. As such a Spirit, He comes into us to be our life. When we believed in Christ and were baptized, God put us into Him as the mold, just as dough is placed into a mold. By being put into the mold we learn the mold. This means that by being put into Christ, we learn Christ. On the one hand, God put us into Christ; on the other hand, Christ has come into us to be our life. Now we may live by Him according to the mold in which we have been placed by God. We are in Christ as the mold, and He is in us as our life. In this way we learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus.</p><h2 class="head5">2) No Longer Walking in the Vanity of Our Mind</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s exhortation is to &ldquo;no longer walk as the Gentiles... walk in the vanity of their mind&rdquo; (Eph. 4:17). The Gentiles are the fallen people, who become vain in their reasonings (Rom. 1:21). They walk without God in the vanity of their mind, being controlled and directed by their vain thoughts. Whatever they do according to their fallen mind is vanity, void of reality. Moreover, Paul&rsquo;s exhortation in Ephesians 4:17 suggests that we the believers, who once walked in the vanity of the mind before we were saved, may continue to do so after we are saved. Even religious activities and practices among Christians which do not express God&mdash;such as Christmas and Easter&mdash;are superstition, falsehood, deception, and vanity. As believers, we should no longer walk in the vanity of the mind. Instead, we should allow the new man to live out God; every detail of the living of the new man must be God expressed in our living. This is to no longer walk in the vanity of the mind but to live the life of the new man as the reality is in Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Grace Ministered to Others<br />
for Their Building Up</h2>
<p>In verse 29 Paul says, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>corrupt</em> signifies what is noxious, offensive, or worthless. Our conversation should not corrupt others but should build them up. The church and every member of the church need the proper building up. This building up is accomplished primarily by our speaking. What proceeds out of our mouth should be that which is good for the building up of the church and all the saints. Furthermore, the word out of our mouth should give grace to those who hear. Grace is God embodied in Christ as our enjoyment and supply. Our word should convey such grace to others. The word that builds up others always ministers grace to the hearer. Our word should communicate God in Christ as enjoyment, imparting Christ to others as their life supply.</p>
<p>In verse 29 we see that Christ is the grace ministered to others for their building up. Our mouth should be filled with words of grace. Words that give grace to the hearers are the overflow of the enjoyment of Christ whom we have experienced. Every word that proceeds out of our mouth should be the Christ whom we enjoy as grace. When we enjoy Christ in a rich way, every word that proceeds out of our mouth ministers grace to the hearers and builds them up.</p>
<p>In contrast to words that minister grace, gossip defiles our mind and our mouth. When we hear evil rumors and gossips, we must bury them and wash our mind and mouth. We enjoy gossiping because we are short of grace. If we are filled with grace, we will not seek satisfaction in gossiping; on the contrary, we will be content with the satisfaction that is in Christ. Instead of gossiping, murmuring, and reasoning (Phil. 2:14), we should speak words that give grace to those who hear, for only such words edify and build up the hearers. What proceeds out of our mouth should be the words of grace that are the overflow of our enjoyment of Christ, whom we love and experience.</p>
<p>The basic elements in the learning of Christ are reality and grace. In contrast to the Gospel of John where grace precedes reality, in Ephesians 4 before Paul mentions grace, that is, the supply, he presents the reality, that is, the principle, the pattern, and the standard. The reality is the shining of light; as members of the Body of Christ under the Head, we should learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus. Yet in order to live out this standard of the reality, we must have grace. In verse 29 Paul relates grace to our speaking. This indicates that we need grace for the details of our daily life, not merely for what we regard as important matters. We may have grace in big matters but not in small matters. For instance, in our daily conversation we may be devoid of grace. In no area of our daily life do we require grace more than in our conversation. If we have grace in this aspect of our living, we will have grace in every other aspect. In all things we need grace to live a life according to the reality that is in Jesus. Grace is our rich supply and enjoyment. If we have this supply and enjoyment, we will be able to live according to the standard of the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In the Life of God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:18 tells us that the Gentiles have been alienated from the life of God. This indicates that the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind because they do not have the life of God. In contrast to the Gentiles, we are not strangers to the life of God. Instead of being alienated from the life of God, we are attached to the source of life. The life of God has become a fountain within our being. We now possess the divine life, and the life of God has become our life (Col. 3:4). Therefore, we should no longer live by our natural life; rather, we should live by the life of God. The reality in Jesus, grace in our mouth, and the life of God pave the way for the new man to live on earth.</p>
<p>Reality and grace are both of life. The divine, eternal, uncreated life of God is the essence of reality and grace. Life is God Himself; that is, life is the being of the Triune God (John 1:4; 11:25; 14:6; Rom. 8:2). When God dispenses Himself into us, we have life. This life is not only our grace for our enjoyment but also our reality for us to live a life full of reality.</p>
<p>The life of God in Ephesians 4:18 is the uncreated, eternal life of God, which man did not have at the time of creation. After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9) that he might receive the uncreated divine life. But man fell into the vanity of his mind and became darkened in his understanding. Now, in such a fallen condition man is unable to touch the life of God until he repents (has his mind turned to God) and believes in the Lord Jesus to receive God&rsquo;s eternal life (Acts 11:18; John 3:16).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of man was that man would partake of the fruit of the tree of life and thereby receive the eternal life of God. Yet in the fall, Satan&rsquo;s evil nature was injected into man. As a result, man had to be barred from the tree of life. According to Genesis 3:24, the Lord &ldquo;drove the man out, and at the east of the garden of Eden He placed the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.&rdquo; Thus, man was alienated from the life of God. The cherubim, the flame, and the sword signify God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. These three things kept sinful man from receiving eternal life. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. Therefore, through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact the tree of life once more. This is the reason Hebrews 10:19 says that we have &ldquo;boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.&rdquo; The tree of life is in the Holy of Holies. As believers in Christ, we have been brought back to the tree of life. Now the divine life in the Holy of Holies may be our daily enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head4">d. By the Sealing Spirit of God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:30 says, &ldquo;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&rdquo; To be sealed is to be sealed in the Holy Spirit as the element. We were sealed in the element of the Holy Spirit. This indicates that God has sealed us with the Holy Spirit as the sealing element. Here the sealing of the Spirit may be considered synonymous to the anointing, which is the moving and working of the indwelling Spirit (1 John 2:20). From the time that we are saved, the Holy Spirit as the seal in us seals us continually with the element of God that we may be transformed in nature until our body is completely transfigured and redeemed. Hence, verse 30 says that we were sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the day of the redemption of our body.</p>
<p>To grieve the sealing Spirit is to displease Him. The sealing Spirit abides in us forever (John 14:16-17), never leaving us. Hence, He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him (Rom. 8:4), that is, when we do not live according to the principle of reality with grace in the details of our daily walk.</p>
<p>For the sealing Spirit to be grieved means that He is not happy with us. Often when we feel unhappy, that feeling of unhappiness is actually the feeling of the sealing Spirit. However, when He feels happy within us, we are happy also. A proper life according to reality and in grace will always make the sealing Spirit happy and give us the joy of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The life of God, the reality in Jesus, and the sealing of the Holy Spirit are the three sources of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Life is of God the Father. This life must become the reality in our daily living (as it was the reality in the daily living of Jesus, the Son of God), and this reality as the practical living out of the Father&rsquo;s life is the essence of the sealing Spirit. The elements of the sealing Spirit are the life of God and the human living of Jesus. As the sealing Spirit saturates and permeates us with the divine life and the reality in Jesus, He is making us a duplication of Jesus in His human living, which is the practical living out of the Father&rsquo;s life. As believers, we have the life of the Father in us; we have a model, the life of Jesus in His human living; and we have the sealing Spirit constituted with the divine life and the human living of Jesus. This sealing Spirit is permeating us to enable us to have a daily life that is suitable for the living of the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Through the Renewing in the Spirit<br />
of the Believers&rsquo; Mind</h2>
<p>As believers, we can experience and enjoy Christ as the reality and grace for the living of the new man through the renewing in the spirit of our mind. In Ephesians 4:23 Paul says, &ldquo;Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; Our being renewed is for our transformation into the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). The spirit here is the regenerated spirit of the believers, which is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, thus becoming the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation. This, of course, implies a process of metabolic transformation. As this process takes place, the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>When our human spirit is regenerated by and thus mingled with the Spirit of God, it becomes the mingled spirit. When our regenerated spirit is gradually enlightened, motivated, inspired, and occupied by the Spirit of God, the mingled spirit spreads into our mind and becomes the spirit of our mind. At the time of regeneration the mingled spirit is only in the realm of our spirit; through renewing, this mingled spirit progressively moves into the territory of our mind to become the spirit of our mind. It is by the spirit spreading into our mind that we are renewed in order that the new man would live on earth.</p>
<p>Our mind needs to be saturated with the mingled spirit and come under the control and direction of the mingled spirit. Our mind should not be the main factor that rules us; rather, the spirit of our mind should be the main factor that rules, reigns, and directs us in all things. We may walk in the vanity of our mind as the Gentiles do. As those who love Christ, we should not have vanity in our mind; instead, we should have the spirit in our mind. Our mind should no longer be full of vanity; rather, it should be saturated with the mingled spirit.</p>
<p>For us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind, we need to pray and read the Word. It is by the teaching of the holy Word and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit that we become renewed in our mind. As we daily pray and read the Word, the Spirit will enlighten us and guide us so that we may be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>By the spirit of the mind we are renewed to fulfill in experience what was accomplished in the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man. The putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man are accomplished facts. Now we must experience and realize these facts by being renewed in the spirit of our mind. As these facts are realized in experience, we live a life that corresponds to the life of Jesus. This means that we live a life of the reality, a life in the shining of light and in the expression of God. When we are renewed in the spirit of our mind to execute the fact of having put off the old man and having put on the new man, we live a life according to the reality that is in Jesus.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Based upon the Believers&rsquo; Having Put Off the Old Man and Having Put On the New man</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:22 Paul says, &ldquo;You put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; It is based upon our having put off the old man and having put on the new man that we can enjoy Christ as the reality and grace for the living of the new man. In our experience, we should cooperate with the Triune God to put off the old man, which He terminated on the cross; we should also cooperate with the Triune God to put on the new man, which He created through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Putting Off the Old Man</h2>
<p>Verse 22 says that we have put off, as regards the former manner of life, the old man. The former manner of life was a walk in the vanity of the mind. Such a manner of life has been terminated and put away. Verse 22 also says that the old man &ldquo;is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; The old man is of Adam, who was created by God but fallen through sin. The article before the word <em>deceit</em> is emphatic and indicates that <em>the deceit</em> is personified. Hence, <em>deceit</em> here refers to the deceiver, the devil, from whom are the lusts of the corrupted old man. The old man is corrupted according to the lusts of the devil, the deceiving one. Outwardly, the manner of life of the old man is a walk in the vanity of the mind. Inwardly, the old man is corrupted according to the lusts of the devil, the lusts of the deceit. This old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6) and was buried in baptism (v. 4). We should praise the Lord that we have put off the old man in baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Putting On the New Man</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:24 Paul says, &ldquo;Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; It was in baptism that we put on the new man (Rom. 6:4b). The new man is the practical church life, which is Christ as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit in a corporate way. To put on the church life as the new man is to put on this entity produced by the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:24 tells us that the new man was created according to God. The old man was created according to the image of God outwardly, without God&rsquo;s life and nature (Gen. 1:26-27), but the new man was created according to God Himself inwardly, with God&rsquo;s life and nature (Col. 3:10).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new man was created in righteousness and holiness of the reality. Righteousness is to be right with God and with man according to God&rsquo;s righteous way, and holiness is godliness and devoutness before God. Righteousness refers to the outward acts, whereas holiness refers to the inward nature. Outwardly, everything related to the new man is righteous; inwardly, everything related to the new man is holy. Righteousness is mainly toward men, and holiness is mainly toward God.</p>
<p>The righteousness and holiness of the new man are of the reality. The article before <em>reality</em> in Ephesians 4:24 is emphatic. As <em>the deceit</em> in verse 22, related to the old man, is the personification of Satan, so <em>the reality</em> here, related to the new man, is the personification of God. This reality was exhibited in the life of Jesus, as mentioned in verse 21. In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of the reality were continuously manifested. It was in the righteousness and holiness of this reality, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created.</p>
<p>The deceit is the devil, and the reality is God. The old man is according to the lusts of the devil, but the new man is in the righteousness and holiness of God. Holiness here is the holiness of the divine person. The new man was created according to God in the righteousness and holiness of God Himself. In order that we might learn Christ, Paul presents a sharp contrast between the old man and the new man, between the devil and God, and between lusts, on the one hand, and righteousness and holiness, on the other. We have been taught that we have already put off the old man and have put on the new man. This means we have put off the lusts and the falsehood of the devil and have put on the righteousness and holiness of God. This God is the reality, and this reality is seen in the living of Jesus on earth. The human living of Jesus was according to the reality, that is, according to God Himself, full of righteousness and holiness. We should praise the Lord that we have learned Christ as the reality is in Jesus. If we learn Christ by putting off the old man and by putting on the new man, we will be in the church life, for the new man actually is the church. If we learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus, then we can have a genuine, proper, and practical church life.</p>
<p>In verses 17 through 24 we have the principle of our renewed daily living for the learning of Christ. This principle is the reality, the living of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth. The Lord&rsquo;s living was that of always putting off His own life and of putting on the Father&rsquo;s life. This is the life of Jesus, and this life is the reality that is the principle of a life of learning Christ. According to this principle, we have put off the old man and have put on the new man.</p>
<p>Every aspect of our daily living should be governed by this principle, not by a standard of ethics. For example, our conversation should be governed not by a standard of ethics but by the New Testament principle of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man. Even how much we laugh or cry should be determined by the principle of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man. This principle is much higher than any ethical standard.</p>
<p>In baptism we put off the old man and put on the new man, which is the church life. Now our daily living in the church life is to be according to the principle of the reality, according to the pattern of the life of reality set up by the living of the Lord Jesus. We have been taught according to this principle as the reality is in Jesus.</p>
<p>The new man, a new corporate person, should live a life like that which Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of reality that expresses God and causes God to be realized by man as the reality. The new man must live as the reality is in Jesus. Since God is the reality, to live as the reality is in Jesus is to live as God is in Jesus. The new man is the expression of God. What the new man lives out must be the expression of God.</p>
<p>In brief, the new man can live and become a living reality by the believers&rsquo; enjoyment of Christ in the practical and fine points revealed in Ephesians 4:17-32. The apostle&rsquo;s exhortation in verses 17 through 32 not only takes grace and reality (vv. 21, 24, 29) as its basic elements but also takes the life of God (v. 18) and the Spirit of God as its basic factors. It is by the life of God in the Spirit of God that we can live a life full of grace and reality, as the Lord Jesus did. The apostle wanted us to live a life full of grace and reality (John 1:14, 17); such a life of Jesus should be our life today in the church. The living of the new man should be exactly the same as the living of Jesus. The way Jesus lived on earth is the way the new man should live today. Grace is God given to us for our enjoyment, and reality is God revealed to us as our reality. When we live and speak reality (Eph. 4:21, 24), we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment (v. 29). May we pursue the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the reality in Jesus and grace in our mouth for the living of the new man.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">70. The Light with Love for the Believers&rsquo; Walk</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:1-21 presents a practical and fine aspect of Christ: the light with love for the believers&rsquo; walk. In the New Testament, light and love, like reality (truth) and grace, are a pair. Light is the source of reality, and love is the source of grace. Hence, light and love form a pair as the source of reality and grace; reality and grace form a pair as the issue of light and love. When light shines out, it becomes truth; when love is expressed, it becomes grace.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John reveals that when Christ came, grace and reality came with Him (1:17); grace came from divine love, and reality came from divine light. The first Epistle of John goes on to reveal that when we receive Christ, fellowship with Him, and live by grace and reality, He brings us into the fellowship with the Father; in the Father&rsquo;s presence we touch His love as the source of grace and His light as the source of truth.</p>
<p>Love and light are actually God Himself; they are God&rsquo;s being, His essence (1 John 4:8; 1:5). Grace and reality come out of God the Father, but love and light are God the Father. First, we believe in the Lord Jesus and receive grace and truth. Then by enjoying grace and truth, we are brought back to the source of grace and truth, God the Father as love and light. By staying in the fellowship with God as love and light, we become beloved children of God walking in love and light. We who seek Christ and love God should be children of light walking in love and light. Because both love and light are God, to be children of light walking in love and light is to be children of God walking in God.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:17-32 we see Christ as the reality and grace for the living of the new man, whereas in 5:1-21 we see Christ as the light with love for the believers&rsquo; walk. Christ as the light shines on the believers, and the issue of this shining is the truth, the reality. The Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind because they do not have the shining of the light (4:17-18), but we the believers have the divine light, which is God Himself, shining over us and even making us light (5:8).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Light Shining on the Believers</h2>
<p>In 5:13-14 we see that Christ is the light shining on the believers. &ldquo;All things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light. Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;reproved&rdquo; in verse 13 may also be rendered &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncovered.&rdquo; If we are being exposed or rebuked, we should simply receive the exposure, the rebuke. If we do this, we will be blessed. We will be aroused from sleep, and Christ will shine on us. Every rebuke is the shining of Christ. Whenever we are rebuked, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I worship You for Your shining. This rebuke is Your shining, and I receive it.&rdquo; To receive a rebuke is to walk in light. This means that if we are not willing to accept a rebuke, we are walking in darkness. If we are truly walking in the light, we will be able to profit from any kind of rebuking.</p>
<p>Christ is light to the believers; Christ shines upon them and enlightens them. According to verse 14, the sleeping one who needs the exposing mentioned in verse 13 is also a dead one. He needs to awake from sleep and arise from the dead. When we expose or reprove anyone who is sleeping and in the darkness of death, Christ will shine on him. Our exposing or reproving in light is Christ&rsquo;s shining.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Making the Believers Light<br />
to Walk as Children of Light in Love</h2>
<p>Christ is the light making the believers light to walk as children of light in love. We the children of light should walk in love.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Walking as Children of Light</h2>
<p>In verse 8 Paul says, &ldquo;You were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.&rdquo; We were once not only dark but darkness itself. Now we are not only the children of light but light itself (Matt. 5:14). As light is God, so darkness is Satan. We were darkness because we were one with Satan. Now we are light because we are one with God in the Lord.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:8 Paul exhorts us to &ldquo;walk as children of light.&rdquo; As God is light, so we, the children of God, are also the children of light. Because we are now light in the Lord and the children of God, we should walk as children of light.</p>
<p>It is rather difficult to point out the difference between truth and light. In our experience we may often realize God as truth to us, as our reality, but sometimes when we enter into God&rsquo;s presence, we sense that we are in the light. At such times, we are not only experiencing reality, but we are in the light itself. Thus, the experience of light is deeper than the experience of truth.</p>
<p>After commanding us to walk as children of light, Paul inserts in verse 9 a parenthetical statement regarding the fruit of the light: &ldquo;The fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth.&rdquo; Goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; righteousness is the way or the procedure by which the fruit of the light is produced; and truth is the reality, the real expression (God Himself), of the fruit of the light. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression, that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.</p>
<p>It is significant that in speaking of the fruit of the light, Paul mentions only three things: goodness, righteousness, and truth. The reason he mentions only three things is that the fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God. Goodness refers to the nature of the fruit of light. The Lord Jesus once indicated that the only one who is good is God Himself (Matt. 19:17). Hence, goodness here denotes God the Father. God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light. Notice that here Paul speaks not of the work of the light nor of the conduct of the light but of the fruit of the light. Fruit is a matter of life with its nature. The nature of the fruit of the light is God the Father.</p>
<p>Righteousness denotes the way or the procedure of the fruit of the light. Righteousness is the procedure by which the fruit of the light is produced. In the Godhead, the Son, Christ, is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). He came to earth to produce certain things according to God&rsquo;s procedure, which is always righteous. Righteousness is God&rsquo;s way, God&rsquo;s procedure. Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose according to His righteous procedure (Rom. 5:17-18, 21). Therefore, the second aspect, the way or procedure, of the fruit of the light refers to God the Son.</p>
<p>Truth is the expression of the fruit of the light. This fruit must be real; that is, it must be the expression of God, the shining of the hidden light. No doubt, this truth refers to the Spirit of reality, the third of the Divine Trinity (John 14:17). Therefore, the Father as the goodness, the Son as the righteousness, and the Spirit as the truth, the reality, are all related to the fruit of the light.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:9 is the definition of walking as children of light. If we walk as the children of light, we will bear the fruit described in verse 9. The fruit we bear by walking as the children of the light must be in goodness, in righteousness, and in truth. The proof that we are walking as children of light is seen in the bearing of such fruit.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Walking in Love</h2>
<p>In verse 2 Paul issues a commandment: &ldquo;Walk in love.&rdquo; As grace and reality (truth) are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love (5:2, 25) and light (vv. 8-9, 13) are the basic elements in the apostle&rsquo;s exhortation in 5:1-33. As previously mentioned, grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth. God is love and light (1 John 4:8; 1:5). When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth. After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, the apostle first took grace and truth as the basic elements for his exhortation, and then love and light. This implies that he wanted our daily life to grow deeper, to progress from the outward elements to the inward.</p>
<p>Love is the inner substance of God, whereas light is the expressed element of God. The inward love of God in sensible, and the outward light of God is visible. Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God. These should be the inner source of our walk. We should live not only according to truth and by grace but also in love and under light. Walking in love and light is deeper and more tender than living according to truth and by grace.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:2 Paul tells us to walk in love. The first seven verses of this chapter cover the matter of love. If we walk in love, we will keep ourselves from uncleanness. To walk in love is to walk in intimacy with God. We should have an intimate relationship with the Father. As those who have received grace, we may come in the Son to contact the Father. In the Father&rsquo;s presence we not only enjoy grace, the expression of love, but we also enjoy love itself. We experience this love in a very intimate way. Because we enjoy the love of God in such an intimate way, we do not want to do anything that displeases the Father. The Father hates fornication, uncleanness, and lust. If we walk in love, we will stay away from such things. Because we love the Father, we will not do anything to grieve His heart. What a tender, delicate, intimate walk this is! This is not simply living by grace; it is walking in love. We should always remember that we are children of God enjoying His love. We are saints separated unto Him and saturated with Him. Therefore, in our daily walk we would always take care of the Father&rsquo;s feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love.</p>
<p>Paul commands us to walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor (v. 2). Here Paul sets forth Christ as the example for our living. In chapter 5 Christ Himself is our example, since in this chapter love expressed by Christ to us (vv. 2, 25) and light shined by Christ upon us (v. 14) are taken as the basic elements. Here Christ, who loved us and gave Himself up for us, is the example of walking in love.</p>
<p>Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor&rdquo; (v. 2). In the Bible there is a difference between an offering and a sacrifice. An offering is for fellowship with God, whereas a sacrifice is for redemption from sin. Christ gave Himself up for us as both an offering, that we might have fellowship with God, and a sacrifice, that He might redeem us from sin.</p>
<p>In loving us, Christ gave Himself up for us. This was for us, but it was a sweet-smelling savor to God. In following His example, our walk in love should be not only something for others but also a sweet-smelling savor to God.</p>
<p>Christ is our pattern for us to live a life in love and in light. By ourselves we could not love others as Christ loved us. We can love as He loved because He is our life. We have Him as our life and as our person (Col. 3:4; 2 Cor. 2:10). We have a person in us who loved us, and now by this person, in this person, and with this person, we can love as He loved. We can take Christ as our pattern to walk and work in love and light.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Through the Believers&rsquo; Being Filled<br />
with God in Their Spirit</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 5 Paul speaks of walking in love and light and of living by being filled in spirit. Thus, in chapter 5 there are three crucial words: <em>love, light,</em> and <em>spirit.</em> Love and light are covered in the first fourteen verses. The next section of this chapter deals with the mingled spirit. In particular, verses 18 through 20 reveal that it is through our being filled with God in our spirit that Christ shines on us and makes us light.</p>
<p>In verse 18 Paul says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in our regenerated spirit is to be filled with Christ (1:23) unto the fullness of God (3:19). To be drunk with wine in the body causes us to become dissolute, but to be filled in our spirit with Christ, with the fullness of God, causes us to overflow with Christ in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God (5:19-20). Day by day we need to be filled in our spirit with the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>To be filled in spirit (v. 18) is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, our human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Our spirit should not be empty; rather, it should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God (3:19). If our spirit is filled with the riches of Christ, we will have no problems in our Christian life.</p>
<p>Verses 19 through 20 are related to the matter of being filled in spirit in verse 18. Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming but also for speaking to one another. Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit. Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter poems, and spiritual songs are poems that are shorter still. All are needed in order for us to be filled with the Lord and to overflow with Him in our Christian life.</p>
<p>Verse 20 goes on to say, &ldquo;Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.&rdquo; We should give thanks to God the Father not only at good times but at all times, and not only for good things but for all things. Even in bad times we should give thanks to God our Father for the bad things. This verse tells us to give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. The reality of the name of the Lord is His person. To be in the Lord&rsquo;s name is to be in His person, in Himself. This implies that we should be one with the Lord in giving thanks to God.</p>
<p>Being filled in spirit implies the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being. We can be the children of light walking in love and light only by the Father&rsquo;s dispensing Himself in the Son as the Spirit into our spirit. When the Triune God in Christ is dispensed into us, we will become in reality the children of God, who is light. Then as children of light, we will not only live by grace and truth; we will also live directly in God, who is love and light. Therefore, the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity constitutes us children of light walking in God as love and light.</p>
<p>Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we need to be filled in our spirit with the Spirit as the divine wine. According to verse 18, we should not be drunk with wine; instead, we should be filled in spirit. We should be filled with God, even &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; with Him. God&rsquo;s love is better than wine (S. S. 1:2). We should drink God&rsquo;s love, soak in His love, and bathe in His love. We need to be those who are permeated and saturated with God&rsquo;s love and even &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; with His love.</p>
<p>As children of light walking in love and light, we should be beside ourselves with the enjoyment of Christ. When we are drunk with God as our love and light, we will truly be children of light walking in love and light. As those who have been born of God and have become the children of God, we should daily be filled, saturated, and permeated with God through the dispensing of the Triune God into our being. We can be &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; with God only by opening ourselves to the divine dispensing. We should let Him as the living water flood us, saturate us, permeate us, and even carry us away (John 7:37-39). When our spirit is filled with the Triune God who has been dispensed into us, we will be drunk with Him not in our body but in our spirit, not in our outer man but in our inner man. If we are drunk with God through His dispensing, we will rejoice and exult, possessing the real enjoyment of the processed Triune God in our daily life, and we will become children of light filled with the Triune God and walking in love and light.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(49)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">71. The Husband of the Church</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 5:22-32 we see that Christ is the Husband of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Head of the Church and the Savior of the Body</h2>
<p>Verse 23 tells us that Christ is not only the Head of the church but also the Savior of the Body. His being the Head is a matter of authority, whereas His being the Savior is a matter of love. We must be subject to Him as our Head, and we must love Him as our Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Loving the Church and Giving Himself Up for Her</h2>
<p>Verse 25 says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Christ&rsquo;s loving the church and giving Himself up for her was for redemption and for the impartation of life. According to John 19:34, blood and water came out of the Lord&rsquo;s pierced side. The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence. In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ&rsquo;s loving her and giving Himself up for her.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Sanctifying the Church and Cleansing Her<br />
by the Washing of the Water in the Word<br />
to Present Her to Himself a Glorious Church,<br />
without Spot or Wrinkle and without Blemish</h2>
<p>Paul says of Christ in verses 26 and 27, &ldquo;He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Sanctifying the Church</h2>
<p>After the church has come into existence, the church needs to be sanctified. The process of sanctification includes saturation, transformation, growth, and building up. Although sanctification includes separation, the main aspect of sanctification is saturation. The church needs to be saturated with all that Christ is. Saturation is accompanied by transformation, growth, and building. Through such a process of sanctification with all these aspects, the church becomes complete and perfect.</p>
<p>Without separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building, the church cannot be perfected and grow into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Only through an all-inclusive process of sanctification can the church become complete and attain to the measure of the stature of Christ&rsquo;s fullness so that Christ can present a perfect church to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Cleansing the Church<br />
by the Washing of the Water in the Word</h2>
<p>In verse 26 Paul says that Christ sanctifies the church by cleansing her through the washing of the water in the word. According to the divine concept, water here refers to the flowing life of God, which is typified by flowing water (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 7:38-39; Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17). The washing of the water is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ. The redeeming blood washes away our sins (1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14), whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as the &ldquo;spot or wrinkle or any such things&rdquo; (Eph. 5:27). In separating and sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood (Heb. 13:12) and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life. We are now in such a washing process in order that the church may be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p>With Eve in Genesis 2 there was no need of cleansing because in that chapter she had not fallen. Rather, she was pure and without mixture. Yet because we are fallen, contaminated, and defiled, we need to be cleansed. Many things in us must be purged away: the flesh, the self, the old man, and the natural life. Furthermore, we have many spots and wrinkles from which we need to be cleansed.</p>
<p>The cleansing by the washing of the water of life is in the word. This indicates that in the word there is the water of life, which is typified by the laver between the altar and the tabernacle (Exo. 38:8; 40:7). The Greek word rendered &ldquo;washing&rdquo; in Ephesians 5:26 means &ldquo;laver.&rdquo; This Greek word is used in the Septuagint as a translation for the Hebrew word for <em>laver.</em> In the Old Testament the priests washed themselves from earthly defilement in the laver (Exo. 30:18-21). Now the laver, the washing of the water, washes us from defilement.</p>
<p>As the priests in the Old Testament came first to the altar and then to the laver, so we come first to the cross to be saved, redeemed, and justified, and then we come to the Word to be cleansed. Day by day, morning and evening, we need to come to the Bible in order to be cleansed by the laver of water in the Word. By coming to the Word in this way, we are cleansed from the defilement we have accumulated in our contact with the world. Whenever we contact the world in the course of our human living, we need to come to the Word to be cleansed.</p>
<p>The washing in Ephesians 5:26 does not deal mainly with sins but with spots and wrinkles. Spots are something out of the natural life, and wrinkles are signs of oldness. Only the water of life can metabolically wash away such defects by the transformation of life. All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word. The more we come to the Word, the more we are nourished. The nourishment we receive brings about an inner cleansing from the defects caused by the natural life and from the wrinkles caused by oldness. We all need such an organic, metabolic washing to take away our defects and the marks of our oldness. As the church is washed organically and metabolically in this way, the church is renewed to be without blemish.</p>
<p>Such a washing takes place entirely by life and by the nourishment of life. Hence, we need to be encouraged to abide in Christ as the source of nourishment and to contact the Word to receive the nourishing element so that we may be washed organically and metabolically from all defects and oldness. By means of such a washing, the church will be perfected and become glorious.</p><h2 class="head5">3) Presenting the Church to Himself</h2>
<p>It is such a glorious church that Christ will present to Himself at His coming back. Glory is God expressed. Hence, to be glorious is to be God&rsquo;s expression. Eventually, the church presented to Christ will be a God-expressing one. Such a church will also be holy and without blemish. To be holy is to be saturated and transformed with Christ, and to be without blemish is to be spotless and without wrinkle, with nothing of the natural life of our old man.</p>
<p>The church that comes out of Christ will go back to Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and went back to Adam. As Eve became one flesh with Adam, so the church which goes back to Christ will be one spirit with Christ.</p>
<p>The church presented to Christ will be glorious; it will be the expression, the manifestation, of God. For the church to become glorious means that the church becomes God&rsquo;s expression. Because Christ&rsquo;s sanctifying will cause the church to be saturated with the essence of God, the church will eventually become the bride to express God. The only way for us to become His expression is to be continually saturated with the divine essence. If we would experience this saturation, we need Christ&rsquo;s sanctifying.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the glorious church, the church that expresses God, will be holy and without blemish. To be holy is to be separated to the Lord from common things and then saturated and permeated with the divine nature, with all that God is. The church that has become holy in this way will also be without blemish. <em>Blemish</em> here is like a defect in a precious stone; this defect comes from mixture within the stone. If we would be without blemish, we must be without mixture; that is, we must not have anything other than God in our being. One day the church will be not only clean and pure but also without blemish, without mixture. The church will be the expression of God Himself mingled with a resurrected, uplifted, and transformed humanity. This is the glorious church, the church that is holy and without blemish. In the future such a glorious church will be presented by Christ to Himself.</p>
<p>The spots and wrinkles do not affect the function of the church. However, they very much detract from the beauty of the church. The church as Christ&rsquo;s bride must be beautiful. When Christ presents the church to Himself, the church will be a beautiful bride. As the universal man, Christ needs the church to be the bride that matches Him. In order to be the bride of Christ, the church must become beautiful and have all the spots and wrinkles removed.</p>
<p>Surely at the time of her presentation to Christ, the bride will not have any wrinkles or spots. In His bride Christ will behold nothing but beauty. This beauty will be the reflection of what He is. The beauty of the bride comes from the Christ who is wrought into the church and expressed through the church. Our beauty is not our behavior; our only beauty is the reflection of Christ, the shining out of Christ from within us. What Christ appreciates in us is the expression of Himself. Nothing less than this will meet His standard or win His appreciation.</p>
<p>Today we must prepare ourselves to be the bride by taking in the element of Christ&rsquo;s riches as our nourishment. Christ is the food for the church. Therefore, as she prepares herself to be presented to Christ, the church must eat Christ. There is no other way to be prepared. Eating Jesus is the way. By eating Him we become a beautiful and even glorious bride.</p>
<p>First, Christ must come into us and then be assimilated by us. Then He will be able to shine out of us. This shining is the glory of the bride, the manifestation of divinity through humanity. Real beauty is the expression of the divine attributes through humanity. Nothing in the universe is as beautiful as this expression. Therefore, the beauty of the bride is Christ shining out of us. It is a matter of divinity expressed through humanity. Through our humanity there is an expression of the divine color, the divine appearance, the divine flavor, the divine nature, and the divine character.</p>
<p>The church is being beautified by partaking of Christ, by digesting Christ, and by assimilating Christ. The more we experience the indwelling Christ in this way, the more He will replace our spots and wrinkles with His element, and the more His riches with the divine attributes will become our beauty. Then we will be prepared to be presented to Christ as His lovely bride.</p>
<p>In the past, Christ as the Redeemer gave Himself up for the church (v. 25) for redemption and the impartation of life (John 19:34); in the present, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church through separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building; and in the future, He as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s loving the church is to separate and sanctify her, and His separating and sanctifying the church are to present her to Himself glorious.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Nourishing and Cherishing the Church</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:29 says, &ldquo;No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.&rdquo; To nourish is to feed us with the living word of the Lord. To cherish is to warm us up. Just as a mother tenderly embraces her baby to warm him and feed him, Christ cherishes us by warming us and nourishes us by feeding us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Nourishing the Church</h2>
<p>To be nourished by Christ is to be supplied with His riches. If we take Christ as our person, we will experience Christ nourishing us. We will continually have the sense of His inward nourishment. We need to experience the nourishment that comes from taking Christ as our person.</p>
<p>Nourishment brings about transformation. We become what we eat. This means that if we eat Christ, we will eventually be constituted with Christ. We will be transformed by the element of Christ that has been dispensed into us. The more we take Christ as our person, the more He nourishes us. Through Christ&rsquo;s nourishment we are transformed. This means that we become a new person with a new element and substance. We should praise the Lord that He nourishes us with Himself, with the riches of all He is.</p>
<p>Today the need of the Lord&rsquo;s people is to take Christ as their person for nourishment. We need to come in touch with the living Christ, to open to Him, and to take Him as our life and person. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, by Your mercy I want to learn to take You as my person and allow You to make Your home in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we are nourished, something enters into our being to meet our need. Nourishment, therefore, must come from a supply. Without a supply, it is impossible to have nourishment. Christ nourishes the church with all the riches of the Father. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead. Hence, all the riches of God are in Him, and He enjoys these riches. Then He nourishes the church with the very riches of the Godhead that He Himself has enjoyed.</p>
<p>This is proved by John 15, where the Lord Jesus says that He is the vine and that the Father is the husbandman. The Father is the Cultivator, the Planter, the Farmer, of the vine. We, the believers in Christ, are the branches of the vine. The vine nourishes the branches with what the vine absorbs from the soil. God the Father is the soil, the water, and everything to Christ as the vine. The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches. This is the nourishing. Christ nourishes the church with the riches of the Father, which He has absorbed and assimilated. By nourishing the church, Christ meets the inward need of the church.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that Christ nourishes the church with His life and with His word. His life and His word are the substance of the nourishment, but neither His life nor His word is the source. The source is the Father. What Christ receives of the Father becomes the life and the life supply which are embodied in the Word. For this reason, the Word is the word of life, even the bread of life or the supply of life. If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply. In order to experience this in a practical way, we daily need to contact the living Word, for the Word is the embodiment of life and of the life supply. The more we abide in the Lord and contact the Word, the more we experience His nourishing. This is the way Christ nourishes the church.</p>
<p>All the members of the church need to practice abiding in the Lord. There should be no insulation, no separation, between us and the Lord and no detachment from Him. As soon as we are detached from Him, the supply of nourishment is cut off. Along with abiding in the Lord constantly, we must daily come to the Word and take it in as our life and life supply. Then we will receive nourishment. Furthermore, all the meetings of the church should be meetings of nourishment. Morning revival and our fellowship with the saints should also be times of nourishment.</p>
<p>As we are nourished by the life and the life supply, we grow and we are purified. As we abide in the Lord to receive the riches of the Father and as we contact the Word to receive the life and the life supply, we are nourished by Christ. In this way Christ nourishes the church He loves.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Cherishing the Church</h2>
<p>Along with the nourishing we have the cherishing. To be cherished is to be softened by being warmed. When we are hard and cold, we need Christ to cherish us, that is, to warm our hearts. After some experiences of His warming, we are softened. Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him. How tender, sweet, and warm the Lord Jesus is! By resting on Him, we who once were hard and cold become soft and warm. The Lord warms us and softens us as we enjoy His tenderness, sweetness, and lovingness. When the Lord sanctifies, cleanses, and nourishes us, He cherishes us with His tender warmth. His cherishing comforts us, soothes us, and calms us.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, Christ&rsquo;s care of the church has two aspects. The inner aspect is the nourishing, and the outer aspect is the cherishing. To be nourished is to have something imparted into us inwardly, whereas to be cherished is to be warmed and comforted outwardly.</p>
<p>Cherishing is related to environment. In our environment or circumstances the Lord Jesus is often real to us as a warm, tender breeze blowing upon us. As this warm breeze comes upon us, we have the sense of being tenderly soothed. Although this takes place in the environment, it is something more than the environment itself. It is even something that surpasses the Lord&rsquo;s presence. When the Lord&rsquo;s presence becomes a gentle breeze, we experience His cherishing. This cherishing includes soothing, comfort, and rest. In the environment of the church life, we often experience the Lord&rsquo;s cherishing, although we may not even be conscious of it. However, if for any length of time we are in an environment where there is no church, we sense that the climate has changed and that the environment is different. Then we begin to sense that we have lost something, that the tender, warm breeze is no longer blowing upon us. We may have everything necessary for our material existence, but we know that something we formerly enjoyed is missing. When we return to the church life, we immediately and spontaneously enter into the environment and atmosphere of the Lord&rsquo;s cherishing. Once again we are warmed, soothed, and comforted. This is cherishing.</p>
<p>Just as a child is cherished by the presence of his mother, so we are cherished by the Lord&rsquo;s presence, which produces an atmosphere of tenderness and warmth to cherish our being. We experience such an atmosphere in the church meetings. How pleasant is the spiritual climate in the gathering of the saints! As soon as we enter this atmosphere, we are cherished by the Lord&rsquo;s presence. It is by the atmosphere produced by the Lord&rsquo;s brooding presence that the Lord cherishes the church. To be in this climate, this atmosphere, this environment, gives us rest, comfort, healing, cleansing, and encouragement. No atmosphere can compare to the atmosphere of the church meetings.</p>
<p>Nourishing and cherishing go together. Through the nourishing we enjoy the supply of life inwardly, and through the cherishing we experience the soothing, comforting atmosphere outwardly. Whenever we are in an atmosphere of cherishing, we can absorb the word of the ministry. This indicates that under the cherishing we receive nourishing. A church that is nourished and cherished in such a way will be strong and healthy.</p>
<p>The nourishing and the cherishing are the church&rsquo;s portion, and they should be found in every meeting. If we are proper, normal, and healthy, we will enjoy the cherishing atmosphere of the Lord&rsquo;s presence in the church, and in this atmosphere receive the nourishing supply of life. We should praise the Lord for the way He cares for the church. In the proper church life we have the privilege of enjoying the Lord in such a fine, tender, intimate, and real way.</p><h2 class="head4">e. One with the Church as the Great Mystery</h2>
<p>Verses 30 through 32 say, &ldquo;Because we are members of His Body. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; Genesis 2:24 indicates that a man and his wife are one flesh. We should regard a husband and wife not as two separate persons but as one complete person, as two halves of a whole unit. A husband and a wife as a complete unit are a marvelous picture of Christ and the church as one entity. Christ and the church as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), typified by a husband and wife as one flesh, are the great mystery.</p>
<p>The mysterious life union of Christ and His Body, the church, is the great mystery in the universe (Eph. 5:32). This mystery is the processed Triune God being joined and mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man to become a universal couple; this is the ultimate point of the mingling of God and man. God is the principal character, and man is His counterpart. Through regeneration, the two share the same life and nature; they live and walk together. In other words, divinity is living in humanity to become the reality of humanity, and the human virtues are living out the divine glory and beauty to become the expression of divinity. Divinity and humanity are mingled as one. Divinity is the content and the reality within; the humanity is the manifestation and the beauty without.</p>
<p>The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, presents a significant and complete picture of Christ and the church. According to the book of Genesis, God did not create man and woman at the same time and in the same way. First, God formed man&rsquo;s body from the dust of the ground. Then He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). After God created man, He said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart.&rdquo; (v. 18). The animals and the birds were brought to Adam, and Adam named them, but for Adam &ldquo;there was not found a helper as his counterpart.&rdquo; (v. 20). Within Adam there was the desire to have a counterpart, to have someone to match him. Among the cattle, the animals, and the birds, there was no counterpart for Adam. In order to produce such a counterpart, &ldquo;God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man&rdquo; (v. 21). While Adam slept, the Lord took one of Adam&rsquo;s ribs and used it for the building of a woman (v. 22). In life, nature, and form the woman was the same as the man. Therefore, when God brought the woman to Adam, Adam exclaimed, &ldquo;This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (v. 23). Adam knew that at last he had found his counterpart.</p>
<p>Because there was no counterpart for Christ in the created universe, God caused Christ to die on the cross. As He slept there, His side was opened, and blood and water came forth (John 19:34). The blood takes care of the problem of sin. (In Genesis 2 the problem of sin had not come in. Therefore, that chapter mentions only the rib that was taken out of Adam; it says nothing about blood.) The water signifies the flowing life of Christ, the eternal life, which produces the church. This life is also typified by the rib. According to John 19, not one of the Lord&rsquo;s bones was broken when He was on the cross. This was a fulfillment of the Scripture, which says, &ldquo;He keeps all his bones; / Not one of them is broken&rdquo; (Psa. 34:20). The unbroken bone of Christ signifies Christ&rsquo;s unbreakable eternal life. Hence, Adam&rsquo;s rib typifies the unbreakable eternal life of Christ. It is with this eternal life that the church is built up as the bride, the counterpart prepared for Christ. In this building up of the bride, Christ gains the church as a match for Himself. Just as Eve had the same life and nature as Adam, the church has the same life and nature as Christ.</p>
<p>In the church there is no place for our natural life and fallen human nature. The human life and nature are not adequate to match Christ. In order to be His counterpart, we need to be one with Christ in life and in nature. This means that Christ and the church as one unit have the same life and nature. Furthermore, Christ and the church have the same image and stature. We should not merely know this as a doctrine but see it as a heavenly vision. We need to see that we must receive Christ as our life and partake of His divine nature. Moreover, we need to see that we must be transformed into His image from glory to glory and attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ because we are to be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart (Eph. 4:13). If we see this vision, we will not only understand the type of Christ and the church but also enjoy Christ as the Husband of the church.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(50)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">72. The Constituents of God&rsquo;s Armor</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that Christ is the constituents of God&rsquo;s armor. In this portion of the Word, the church is revealed as the warrior to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy. As the warrior, the church needs might and the whole armor of God.</p>
<p>Verse 11 opens with the words, &ldquo;Put on the whole armor of God.&rdquo; To fight the spiritual warfare, we need the whole armor of God. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body. The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers together make up this unique warrior. Only the corporate warrior can wear the whole armor of God; no individual believer can. We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</p>
<p>The charge to put on the whole armor of God is an imperative, a command. God has provided the armor for us, but He does not put it on for us. Rather, we ourselves must put on the armor God has provided. We must exercise our will to cooperate with God&rsquo;s command to put on the armor.</p>
<p>The Lord with His might is the armor that we put on for our protection. We as the Body need to put on Christ Himself as our armor. In order to fight the spiritual warfare, we must have Christ as the whole armor of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Truth as the Girdle</h2>
<p>The first part of verse 14 says, &ldquo;Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth.&rdquo; For us to gird our loins is to strengthen our entire being. Our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth. This strengthening is not for sitting but for standing.</p>
<p>According to the way the word <em>truth</em> is used in chapter 4 (vv. 15, 21, 24-25), <em>truth</em> here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us as our living. This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us (John 14:6). Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for spiritual warfare. Our living must have a principle and a standard. This is nothing less than God Himself expressed in our living in a practical way. When such truth girds our loins, we are made strong for the purpose of standing.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that our daily living is far below the standard of the truth as it is in Jesus. Instead of being able to stand and to withstand in the evil day, we will flee. Because in our daily walk there is no testimony and no expression of God, we do not have the strength to stand against the stratagems of the devil. If our daily living is loose, we are not able to stand against the powers of darkness. In order for us to stand, our daily living must be according to the principle of the truth and up to the standard of the truth&mdash;that is, God Himself expressed as the principle of our daily walk, as the standard of our daily living, and as the pattern of our life.</p>
<p>Those who have such a living certainly have their loins girded with truth. These are the ones who are able to face attack and opposition. Because they are girded with truth, they can stand before the opposers. But if God is not expressed in our daily life and walk, we will not have a girdle about our loins, and we will have no strength to stand against the enemy. We will not have the power to face opposition or controversy.</p>
<p>The truth with which we are girded for spiritual warfare is actually the Christ whom we experience. In Philippians 1:21 Paul says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; This Christ whom Paul lived was his girdle of truth. This Christ was God expressed and revealed in Paul&rsquo;s daily walk. Because Paul&rsquo;s daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances. Because Paul had been girded with truth, he had the strength to stand.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Righteousness as the Breastplate</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:14 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Having put on the breastplate of righteousness.&rdquo; The breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast. Satan is our accuser. In fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense (Acts 24:16), but no matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness. Righteousness is to be right with both God and man. If we have just a little problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all of our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy&rsquo;s accusations. Such righteousness is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>If in anything we are not righteous, our conscience will be a conscience with offense, but if we are to engage in spiritual warfare, we must have a conscience void of offense, a conscience without holes. When our conscience has holes in it, our faith will leak out through the holes. If accusations and offenses remain on our conscience, faith will disappear. Therefore, we need to deal with our conscience in order to have a good conscience, a conscience void of offense. In addition, we need to put on the breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:11 says, &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo; To be covered by the blood of the Lamb is mainly to have upon us the breastplate of righteousness. Righteousness is in the blood, and the covering of the blood is the breastplate. Although this may be difficult to explain doctrinally, we can understand it experientially. Whenever we intend to fight against the powers of darkness, Satan, through his accusations, causes our conscience to become very sensitive. These feelings actually are not the sensitivity of the conscience but the result of Satan&rsquo;s accusations. Immediately our response to such accusations should be, &ldquo;I overcome Satan, the accuser, not by my perfection and not even by a conscience void of offense but by the blood of the Lamb. I am defended against his accusations by the breastplate of righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The righteousness that covers our conscience and that guards us from Satan&rsquo;s accusations is Christ Himself. He is our righteousness. We are covered not by our own righteousness but by Christ as our righteousness. Some may wonder how the breastplate of righteousness can be related both to Christ and to the blood. In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ. Apart from His blood, Christ could not cover us. Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness. Whenever we are about to take part in the spiritual warfare, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, cover me with Yourself as my righteousness. Lord, I hide under Your blood.&rdquo; Furthermore, we must tell the accuser, &ldquo;Satan, I overcome you, not by my merit but by the prevailing blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Gospel of Peace as the Firm Foundation<br />
to Shoe Our Feet</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:15 says, &ldquo;Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.&rdquo; Our feet must be shod in order to have a firm footing and the strength to stand in the battle. This is not for walking a way or running a course but for fighting the battle.</p>
<p>The expression <em>the firm foundation of the gospel of peace</em> means the establishment of the gospel of peace. Christ has made peace for us on the cross, both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel (2:13-17). This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Being thus shod, we will have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation also is Christ (v. 14).</p>
<p>In order to understand Paul&rsquo;s thought in this verse, we need to see that here the gospel is the gospel of peace. According to verses 15 and 16, on the cross Christ accomplished peace so that the Gentiles could contact the Jewish believers and so that all the believers could contact God. This peace is the glad tidings, the good news; in other words, it is the gospel. For this reason, verse 17 says that Christ preached the gospel of peace.</p>
<p>We also should preach this peace as the gospel. The gospel of peace spoken of in 6:15 is the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross for all the believers to be one with God and for the Gentile believers to be one with the Jewish believers. This peace is our gospel. With this peace there is a firm foundation, which is a secure footing for our standing. Therefore, the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross is a firm footing, a firm foundation. As we fight against the evil powers, the peace Christ has accomplished is a firm foundation for our feet. To take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation.</p>
<p>In fighting, the crucial thing is to stand. We must be able to stand and to withstand the attacks of the enemy. Those who are defeated will run, but those who are victorious will stand. As we wrestle against the enemy, we will find that Satan does not run away. Even when we are victorious over him, he continues to wrestle with us. Therefore, we need to be able to stand. Spiritual warfare is a wrestling match. In order to wrestle against the enemy, we need a firm footing. If we have our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, we can withstand any attack of the enemy. If we have such a firm footing, nothing can shake us. No matter what happens, we can stand and withstand in the evil day.</p>
<p>Usually peace is the opposite of warfare. When we have peace, we do not fight, and when we fight, we do not have peace. But here we fight with peace and in peace. We fight by standing in peace. If we lose the peace between us and God or between us and other believers (Col. 3:15), we lose the standing to fight. Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and to be one with the saints. This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand fast against the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Faith as the Shield</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:16 says, &ldquo;Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.&rdquo; We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as the standing for our feet, and faith to shield our entire being. If we live by God as truth, we have righteousness (4:24), and righteousness issues in peace (Heb. 12:11; Isa. 32:17). Having all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith (Heb. 12:2). For us to stand firmly in the battle, we need to be equipped with all these four items of God&rsquo;s armor.</p>
<p>The shield of faith is not something that we put on, but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy. Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we will spontaneously have faith. This faith is a safeguard against the flaming darts, the attacks, of the enemy.</p>
<p>We certainly are not to have faith in our own ability, strength, merit, or virtue. Our faith must be in God (Mark 11:22). God is real, living, present, and available. We need to have faith in Him.</p>
<p>We also should have faith in God&rsquo;s heart. Every Christian needs to know and trust both God and the heart of God. God&rsquo;s heart toward us is always good. No matter what may happen to us or what kind of sufferings we may experience, we should always believe in the goodness of God&rsquo;s heart (Rom. 8:31-39). God has no intention to punish us, to injure us, or to cause us to suffer loss.</p>
<p>Along with faith in God&rsquo;s heart, we should have faith in God&rsquo;s faithfulness (1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 1:9). We may change, but God does not change. As James 1:17 says, with God there is no variation or shadow cast by turning. Furthermore, God cannot lie (Titus 1:2) but is always faithful to His word.</p>
<p>God is not only faithful but also able. Therefore, we need to have faith in God&rsquo;s ability. In Ephesians 3:20 Paul declares that God &ldquo;is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still another aspect of our faith is faith in God&rsquo;s word. God is bound to fulfill all that He has spoken. The more He speaks, the more responsible He becomes to fulfill His own word. We can tell Him, &ldquo;God, You have spoken, and Your written Word is in our hand. Lord, You are bound to fulfill Your word.&rdquo; We should praise God for His faithful word.</p>
<p>We also need to have faith in God&rsquo;s will. Because God is a God of purpose, He has a will (1:9, 11). His will with respect to us is always positive. Hence, no matter what befalls us, we should not doubt God&rsquo;s will, and we should not care for our happiness or our environment. Rather, we should have faith in and care for God&rsquo;s will. Our environment may change, but God&rsquo;s will never changes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must have faith in God&rsquo;s sovereignty (Rom. 9:19-29). Because God is sovereign, He can never make a mistake. Under His sovereignty, even our mistakes work for good. If God did not sovereignly allow us to make mistakes, we could not possibly make them. When we are wrong, we need to repent. Yet there is no need for us to regret, for that means we lack faith that God is sovereign over our mistakes. After we repent for a mistake or shortcoming, we should exercise faith in God&rsquo;s sovereignty. We could not have made that mistake if He had not sovereignly allowed us to do so. Hence, there is no need for regret.</p>
<p>We all need to have full faith in God, in God&rsquo;s heart, in God&rsquo;s faithfulness, in God&rsquo;s ability, in God&rsquo;s word, in God&rsquo;s will, and in God&rsquo;s sovereignty. If we have such faith, Satan&rsquo;s flaming darts will not be able to damage us.</p>
<p>The flaming darts are Satan&rsquo;s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks. Every temptation is a deceit, a false promise. Satan often makes proposals to us. For this reason, we need to get into the Word. If we are not in the Word, we will have no covering against the devil&rsquo;s proposals. Doubts and questions are also the flaming darts of Satan. Note that a question mark looks very much like a serpent. It was Satan who asked Eve, &ldquo;Did God really say?&rdquo; (Gen. 3:1). When the devil questions us in this way, our response should be to flee, without even talking to him. Many times Satan attacks us with lies, but the shield of faith guards us against these flaming darts.</p>
<p>The devil&rsquo;s flaming darts come as thoughts injected into our mind. These thoughts may seem to be our own thoughts, but they are actually Satan&rsquo;s. We should never confess to the Lord all these thoughts injected into us by Satan in his subtlety. Instead, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am fallen, but I am under Your cleansing. Satan, this thought is yours, and you must bear the responsibility for it. I will not share this responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we would have the faith to be defended against Satan&rsquo;s flaming darts, we need a proper spirit with a conscience void of offense. However, faith is not mainly in our spirit nor in our conscience but in our will, the strongest part of our heart. Romans 10:10 says that we believe with our heart. According to our experience, this faith in our heart is related mainly to the exercise of our will. No one with a weak will can have strong faith. In James 1:6 we are told that he who doubts is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind. Such a person has a vacillating will. Hence, if we would have faith, we need to exercise our will.</p><h2 class="head4">e. Salvation as the Helmet</h2>
<p>In the first part of Ephesians 6:17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation.&rdquo; This is for covering our mind against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God&rsquo;s salvation. Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts into our mind. God&rsquo;s salvation is the covering that we take up against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life (John 16:33).</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s darts come to us through our mind. Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation. We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and then salvation. If we have truth in our living, we will have righteousness as our covering. Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith. Then faith brings in salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Spirit, the Word of God, as the Sword</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul also speaks of &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; Among the six items of God&rsquo;s armor, the sword of the Spirit is the only one for attacking the enemy. With the sword we cut the enemy to pieces. However, we do not take up the sword first. Rather, we must first put on the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes, and then take up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation. When we are entirely protected and have salvation as our portion, we may receive the sword of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The antecedent of the word <em>which</em> in verse 17 is <em>Spirit,</em> not <em>sword.</em> This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God. Both the Spirit and the word are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13). Christ as the Spirit and the word furnishes us with a sword as an offensive weapon to defeat and slay the enemy.</p>
<p>The Word is the Bible. But if this Word is only the printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword. The Greek word for <em>word</em> in Ephesians 6:17 is <em>rhema,</em> the instant word spoken at any moment by the Spirit in any situation. When the <em>logos,</em> the constant word in the Bible, becomes the <em>rhema,</em> the instant word, this <em>rhema</em> will be the Spirit. This <em>rhema,</em> which becomes the Spirit, is the sword that cuts the enemy to pieces. For example, we may read a particular verse again and again, only to have it remain the <em>logos,</em> a word in letters. Such a word cannot kill anything, but one day the Spirit speaks this verse to us, and it becomes the <em>rhema</em> to us, the present, instant, living speaking of the Spirit. At that time this <em>rhema</em> becomes the Spirit. For this reason, in John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Here also the Greek text for words is rhema. The instant, present word is the Spirit; this kind of word is the sword. Therefore, the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one.</p>
<p>In our Christian experience the Word and the Spirit should always be one. Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit. In our experience we receive the Spirit mostly through the Word. As we contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to us. However, we should not take the Bible without the Spirit. We must have both the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ is both the Spirit and the Word. He is not the Spirit without being the Word nor the Word without being the Spirit. Because He is both the Word and the Spirit, He created us with a mind to understand and a spirit to receive. When we come to the Bible, we should exercise both our mind and our spirit. We exercise our mind by reading and our spirit by praying. Since we need both to read and to pray, we should pray-read the Word. Through pray-reading our spirit becomes strong and ready to kill the enemy. We should not only exercise our spirit to receive the Spirit but also exercise our mind to consider the Word. The more our spirit is strengthened by pray-reading the Word, the more eager we become to use the sword of the Spirit to slay the enemy. In our speaking we should have a sword with which to cut the enemy to pieces.</p>
<p>With the whole armor of God we have truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation. Finally, we have the <em>rhema,</em> the Spirit, the sword; this is our offensive weapon for attacking the enemy. When we have the whole armor of God, including the sword, we are not only protected but also prepared to wrestle against the enemy. By having truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation, we are equipped, qualified, strengthened, and empowered to use the sword in spiritual warfare. Then the enemy is subject to the cutting of our sword, and he is slaughtered by us.</p><h2 class="head4">g. Applied by Prayer</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.&rdquo; The expression <em>by means of all prayer and petition</em> modifies the word <em>receive</em> in verse 17. By prayer we receive both the helmet of salvation and the word of God. This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. We need to pray as we are receiving the word of God. We have seen that the whole armor of God is composed of six items. Prayer may be considered the seventh. It is the means by which we apply the other items.</p>
<p>The modifier <em>by means of all prayer and petition</em> in verse 18 is related to all six items of the armor covered in verses 14 through 17. It is by means of all prayer and petition that we gird our loins with the truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, and have our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace. Furthermore, it is by prayer that we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Whenever we are about to put on the armor or take up any item of the armor, we need to pray. We cannot and we should not attempt to use any part of God&rsquo;s armor without prayer. Prayer is the unique way to apply the armor of God. It is prayer that makes the armor available to us in a practical way. Therefore, prayer is crucial and vital.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Our Being Empowered in Him and<br />
in the Might of His Strength</h2>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.&rdquo; The Greek word here rendered <em>empowered</em> has the same root as the word for <em>power</em> in 1:19. To deal with God&rsquo;s enemy, to fight against the evil force of darkness, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air. The fact that we are to be empowered in the Lord indicates that in the spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom, we can fight only in the Lord, not in ourselves. Whenever we are in ourselves, we are defeated. Therefore, we need to be empowered in the Lord; that is, we need to experience Christ as our power who strengthens us inwardly, saturating every part of our being. When Christ empowers us as the heavenly dynamo and energizes us from within, He saturates us and invigorates us.</p>
<p>We cannot fight the spiritual warfare in ourselves; we can fight only in the Lord and in the might of His strength. In 6:10 Paul refers to power, might, and strength. First, we are empowered by the power that raised Christ from among the dead and made Him to be the Head over all things. Then we know God&rsquo;s might and strength.</p>
<p>The charge to be empowered implies the need to exercise our will. If we would be empowered for spiritual warfare, our will must be strong and exercised. We should not be weak-willed and vacillating. To be empowered involves our will. In Paul&rsquo;s command to be empowered, an active element&mdash;<em>be</em>&mdash;is combined with a passive element&mdash;<em>empowered.</em> We need to exercise our will to be empowered in the Lord.</p>
<p>In summary, the armor of God that covers us is Christ realized by us as our truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation. Truth as the girdle, righteousness as the breastplate, the gospel of peace as the firm foundation, faith as the shield, salvation as the helmet, the Spirit, the word of God, as the sword&mdash;all these are the various aspects of Christ in our experience. We should experience Christ as our girdle of truth; we should experience Christ as righteousness that covers our conscience; we should experience Christ as the gospel of peace to strengthen our stand to fight the spiritual warfare; we should experience Christ as the faith to shield our entire being from the attacks of the enemy; we should experience Christ as salvation to cover our mind against the negative thoughts Satan seeks to inject into our mind; and we should experience Christ as the sword of the Spirit to slay the enemy. All these aspects of Christ are applied to us by prayer. In order to fight the spiritual warfare, we should experience Christ as the constituents of the divine armor and be empowered in Christ and in the might of His strength. As the corporate warrior we should be inwardly empowered with Christ as the heavenly dynamo and outwardly clothed with Christ as the constituents of God&rsquo;s armor; in other words, we should be mingled with Christ. May we endeavor to experience and enjoy Him as the constituents of God&rsquo;s armor in order to fight the spiritual warfare and defeat God&rsquo;s enemy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">73. The Source of Peace,<br />
Love with Faith, and Grace</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:23-24 records Paul&rsquo;s blessing: &ldquo;Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.&rdquo; These verses indicate that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the source of peace, love with faith, and grace, and that for us to love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility, we need peace, love, faith, and grace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Peace, Love with Faith, and Grace<br />
for the Church Life</h2>
<p>Christ is the source of peace, love with faith, and grace for the church life. In the beginning of the book, the apostle&rsquo;s greeting is first with grace as the enjoyment and then with peace as the result of the enjoyment (1:2). But in the conclusion the elements are presented vice versa, progressing from the result, peace, to the enjoyment, grace. In other words, after we have come into peace, we still need grace. We first enter into peace through grace. Now as we are enjoying peace, we need even more grace. This is grace upon grace; it also indicates that our experience is from grace to grace.</p>
<p>The reason the apostle inserted <em>love</em> between <em>peace</em> and <em>grace</em> here in the conclusion is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love. Paul realized that love is crucial. He spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace.</p>
<p>According to verse 23 of chapter 6, love is from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. The point here is that love originates with God, not with us. Eventually, however, God&rsquo;s love becomes our love. This is the reason Paul in verse 24 speaks of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ. God&rsquo;s love for us becomes our love for Him. Peace is maintained by this kind of love. By living in the intimacy of God&rsquo;s presence, love comes to us. This love then returns to the Lord and becomes our love for Him. By this traffic of love, peace is maintained, and we are preserved in the enjoyment of grace, which is needed for us to live a church life that fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and solves God&rsquo;s problem with His enemy.</p>
<p>Love with faith is the means by which we partake of and experience Christ (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith is for receiving Him (John 1:12), and love is for enjoying Him (14:23). In the Gospel of John we are told first to believe in the Son in order to have eternal life (3:15). To believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him. The Gospel of John also emphasizes love. In chapter 21 the Lord asks Peter concerning his love for Him (vv. 15-17). Furthermore, in 14:23 the Lord speaks of the Father and the Son making an abode with the one who loves the Lord Jesus. Therefore, by faith we receive the Lord Jesus, and by love we enjoy Him. For this reason, in 1 Timothy 1:14 Paul puts faith and love together.</p>
<p>Also in 1 Thessalonians 5:8 Paul speaks of faith and love. In this verse he encourages the saints to put on &ldquo;the breastplate of faith and love.&rdquo; Comparing this verse to Ephesians 6:14, we see that there are two kinds of breastplates, one for our daily living and the other for fighting. For our daily living we need the breastplate of faith and love. Faith and love are both tender; they are signified in the Bible by the breasts. Such tender parts of our being, our spiritual breasts, need to be covered with the breastplate. By means of the breastplate, our faith and love, which are necessary for a proper Christian life, are preserved. The breastplate of righteousness in verse 14, on the contrary, is for fighting. Whenever we take part in spiritual warfare, our conscience must be protected from Satan&rsquo;s accusation by the breastplate of righteousness.</p>
<p>The verses concerning faith and love in the Gospel of John, 1 Thessalonians, and 1 Timothy indicate that faith and love go together. But in Ephesians 6:23 Paul does not speak of faith and love nor love and faith, but love <em>with</em> faith. This indicates that we need faith as a match and support for our love. Love with faith is needed. According to Galatians 5:6, faith operates through love. This operation is very delicate. In Galatians, a book that emphasizes justification by faith, we are told in verse 6 that &ldquo;in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love.&rdquo; This verse indicates that our faith operates through love; believing in the Lord Jesus is a matter of love. A person who hears the gospel, repents, and then comes to appreciate the Lord Jesus and to feel that He is altogether lovable, will have a strong faith. This faith operates through his love for the Lord. The more we love the Lord, the stronger will be our faith in Him. This is Paul&rsquo;s thought in Galatians.</p>
<p>Ephesians, however, emphasizes love, not faith. According to Galatians, the more we appreciate the Lord Jesus and love Him, the more we will believe in Him. This is for salvation. However, in Ephesians Paul&rsquo;s concern is not salvation but continuation and fellowship. This requires love with faith. If our faith is weakened because we accept doubts and questions, we will find it difficult to love the Lord. Whenever faith is damaged, love will be damaged also. In order to continue in fellowship with the Lord through loving Him, we need a strong faith. Therefore, we need both the faith that operates through love and the love that is with faith.</p>
<p>Love with faith is the conclusion of Ephesians, the book on the church. The church needs to enjoy Christ in love with faith, which operates through love (Gal. 5:6). Love comes from God to us, and faith goes from us to God. By means of this traffic of love and faith, peace remains our portion. We are kept in peace by the coming of God&rsquo;s love to us and by the going of our faith to Him. This traffic also keeps us in the continual supply of grace, in the enjoyment of the Lord (Eph. 6:24).</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the Lord as grace is with those who love Him. In Ephesians the phrase <em>in love,</em> which is rich in feeling, is used repeatedly (1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2). Later, the church in Ephesus was rebuked by the Lord because she had lost her first love toward Him (Rev. 2:4). One of the main points revealed in this book is that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is also the bride of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s wife. With the Body, the emphasis is on taking Christ as life; with the wife, the emphasis is on loving Christ. Therefore, this book emphasizes and also concludes with our love toward the Lord. The church in Ephesus, the recipient of this Epistle, failed in the matter of loving the Lord. Such a failure became the source of and main reason for the failure of the church throughout the ages (Rev. 2&mdash;3).</p><h2 class="head4">b. For Us to Love<br />
Our Lord Jesus Christ in Incorruptibility&mdash;<br />
in All That the Church Is</h2>
<p>Christ is the peace, love with faith, and grace in our experience in order that we may love Him in incorruptibility, that is, in all that the church is. For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruptibility, that is, in and according to all the crucial things revealed and taught in the six chapters of this book, such as the church as the Body of Christ, the new man, the economy of God&rsquo;s mystery, the oneness of the Spirit, reality and grace, light and love, and the items of God&rsquo;s armor. All these things are incorruptible because they are true, genuine, and real. For the sake of the church, our love toward the Lord must be in these incorruptible things.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:17 Paul says that God is incorruptible, and in 2 Timothy 1:10 he says that the Lord &ldquo;nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&rdquo; First Corinthians 15 tells us that in resurrection the corruptible things will become incorruptible (vv. 50-53). To love the Lord in incorruptibility means to love Him in the new creation. All the things of the old creation are corruptible. This is proved by Romans 8 where we see that the whole creation is groaning under the slavery of corruption (vv. 21-22). Everything of the old creation is corruptible, whereas the new creation is not. We must love the Lord in the new creation, not in the old creation.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:24 is the conclusion of the entire book. In the six chapters of Ephesians Paul reveals to us the incorruptible things: Christ, the church, and all the positive items related to Christ and the church. We must love the Lord in these incorruptible things. We should love the Lord according to the Father&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating us unto sonship; we should love the Lord according to the Son&rsquo;s redemption; we should love the Lord according to the sealing and pledging of the Spirit; we should love the Lord according to the hope of God&rsquo;s calling, according to the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and according to the surpassing greatness of His power which made Christ the Head over all things to the church; and we should love the Lord according to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection which made us alive, resurrected us, and seated us in the heavenlies.</p>
<p>One of the incorruptible things revealed in Ephesians is the Body of Christ as the embodiment and expression of the processed Triune God (4:4-6). If we would love the Lord Jesus in incorruptibility, we must love Him according to the reality of the Body of Christ as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. This means that our being should be mingled with the Triune God; otherwise, our love for the Lord is corruptible.</p>
<p>We should not love the Lord in the way of corruption; that is, we should not love the lord in a natural way, in the way of the old creation. Rather, we should love the Lord in the way of the new creation. For example, if we would love the Lord in incorruptibility in the matter of financial giving, we should not let our right hand know what our left hand is doing (Matt. 6:3). To give in the way of making a show is in the old creation. Since we are the kingdom people, our righteous deeds should be kept secret as much as possible (vv. 4, 6, 18). Whatever we do in our spirit under the heavenly rule solely in order to please our Father must not be interfered with by our flesh in its lusting for man&rsquo;s glory. We as the kingdom people should live by the Father&rsquo;s divine life and walk according to our spirit. To love the Lord in incorruptibility is to love Him in our mingled spirit, our spirit regenerated, renewed, and indwelt by the Spirit of God. If we do anything in our flesh, it is done in corruption.</p>
<p>To do things in the way of not making a display or a show of oneself is in the new creation. When we give a testimony in a meeting, we should try our best not to make a show. If we testify in order to make a show or a display, we will function in the old creation, that is, function in corruption. The Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for desiring to make a show; whatever they did, they did so to be seen by men (23:5a). In Matthew 6:16-18 the Lord also said, &ldquo;When you fast, do not be like the sullen-faced hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.&rdquo; This indicates that we should not make a show in anything we do; otherwise, we will be serving in corruption.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many Christians love the Lord concerning the church in corruption. Both the organization and the practices of the denominations are corruptible things, for they are of the old creation. If anyone loves the Lord yet serves Him according to the ways of the denominations, this is in corruption.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul speaks of the church as the Body of Christ, &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; To be sure, the church in these verses does not refer to any religious organization. The church as the Body of Christ is incorruptible, but religious organizations are corruptible. To stand on the genuine ground of oneness, the oneness of the Body of Christ, is incorruptible. In contrast, to take any ground other than that of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ kept and expressed in the local churches (Rev. 1:11) is to take the ground of corruption. Instead of loving the Lord in corruptibility, we should love Him in incorruptibility, that is, in a pure way that can stand forever.</p>
<p>Paul concludes his Epistle according to its contents, because whatever is revealed in this Epistle is incorruptible. The Triune God, His dispensing, and the issue of His dispensing&mdash;the church, the Body of Christ, the new man, and the bride&mdash;are all incorruptible, whereas all other things in the universe will be corrupted. Paul does not conclude his Epistle by simply saying, &ldquo;Grace be with everyone.&rdquo; Rather, he declares, &ldquo;Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.&rdquo; The reason for this is that the condition for receiving grace is that we love the Lord in incorruptibility. If we would receive grace and practice the proper church life, we need to love the Lord in incorruptibility. For the church our love toward the Lord must be incorruptible, immortal, and imperishable. Such a love is genuine and sincere.</p>
<p>Ephesians presents profound matters that are based upon divine, heavenly, and spiritual facts, all of which have been designed by the Father, accomplished by Christ the Son, and applied to us by the Spirit. Although our present experience of Christ may fall short of these deep and marvelous aspects of Christ as revealed in Ephesians, we should all endeavor to experience and enjoy Him in all these aspects.</p></body></html>
