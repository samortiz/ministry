Even the spiritual gifts can be a problem to the Body of Christ. It all depends on how we exercise these gifts.<p>First, we need to realize that all the spiritual gifts and the exercise of the gifts must be for the Body. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &#8220;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&#8221; All the gifts with their functions and exercise must be for the Body. Moreover, we should realize that not only is the Head Christ but the Body also is Christ. Following this, verse 13 says, &#8220;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free.&#8221; This tells us that all the gifts from the Holy Spirit are for the Body. Regrettably, however, the gifts today often distract believers from the Body rather than build up the Body. What should be used for building becomes a distraction; this is wrong. The more we have the gifts, function with the gifts, and exercise the gifts, the more we need to build up the Body. All the believers must be focused on the Body. We should not distract any member from the Body by using our gift.<p>The best way for us to exercise the gifts is in the way of love (13:1-13). Love is the best, excellent way. Real love is Christ with the cross. In order to exercise the genuine love toward others, we must experience Christ with the cross. Our self has to be dealt with, and we must take Christ as everything. Then we will know how to love others. Even with the exercise of the gifts, we may not have love. On the contrary, instead of loving others, we may simply speak in tongues every day with no concern for others. If we read chapters twelve through fourteen carefully, we will see that the intention of the writer is that we would prefer to have love rather than to exercise the gifts. If our exercise of spiritual gifts does not build up others or profit others, we should be willing to drop the gifts and exercise our love toward others. This is the best way for us to exercise our gifts, because their purpose is to build up the Body. If our exercise of the gifts does not fulfill this purpose, we should be willing to drop them. If love builds up others more than gifts do, we should exercise love rather than the gifts.<p>Here again we must apply the first principle of this book. The person who has the gifts must be dealt with. Then he will have the best way to exercise the gifts, which is love. This love, no doubt, is Christ with the experience of the cross.<h2 class=head2>The Problem concerning Resurrection</h2><p>The tenth case involves the matter of resurrection (15:1-58). It is surprising that even a real Christian would not believe that there is a resurrection. These were not &#8220;modernists&#8221;; the Corinthians were genuine Christians, but among them there were some who did not believe in the fact of resurrection. This case is related to the third principle in this book, the principle of being spiritual, soulish, or fleshly. These few were soulish persons because they tried to reason concerning the resurrection by their mental understanding. We cannot understand spiritual things with our mentality, our soulish mind; if we try to, we are soulish.<p>In this chapter there is a spiritual and heavenly revelation that not only confirms the resurrection but reveals the ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ. The ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ will transpire on the day Christ returns and life swallows up death (v. 54). Here, therefore, it is not only a matter of resurrection, but a matter of life swallowing up death. At that time the Body of Christ will be in its full consummation, testifying what Christ is and how much He is.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
