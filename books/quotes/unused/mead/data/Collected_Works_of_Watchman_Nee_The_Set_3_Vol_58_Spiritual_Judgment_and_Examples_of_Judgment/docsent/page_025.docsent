   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 11 Date:July 3, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER A. G.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in 1936 in Ch'ang-ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before that I was a merchant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My colleagues pleaded with me to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I agreed with the Lord's teachings, but I was not convinced by those who believed in such teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It irked me to hear men singing and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once I met a preacher who was not at all attractive but who was very sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A burden fell upon my heart when I heard him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I had sinned and gambled much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That day I knelt down to confess my sins in tears to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I also went to my wife and colleagues to confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later someone gave me a copy of The Christian magazine as well as other publications like Twelve Baskets Full, A Debate concerning Denominations, The Assembly Life, The Straight Pathway, etc. After two years, I became a deacon, even a chief among the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time I was still in a denomination, and everyone in that denomination supported what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I changed the form of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I called holy communion the Lord's table and addressed others as brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I changed the pastoral system from a paid position to an unpaid one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the congregation insisted on having a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was a split of opinions, and some brothers and I left the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later I began to meet with the brothers and sisters in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I felt that I should offer up myself, as well as everything I had, to the Lord to serve Him singleheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I realized that the Holy Spirit had been working in me and had frustrated me from making any fortune in the world so that I would be rich in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After three years I became dry within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day I read Colossians 1:26-27, which says, "The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints...which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was overjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was filled with the Holy Spirit for six or seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I had been a Christian for over seven or eight years but had never tasted such sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During this time I did not go anywhere except to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For seven or eight years, I have had the burden to visit the brothers in various places so that both they and I would receive the profit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have since known more of the truth concerning our calling, our submission to authority, the separation of the inner man from the outer man, etc. I hope that our brother will give me a word of help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Submission to authority and our dealing with God are daily exercises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The scope of this dealing should be widened all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many things which were once considered legitimate, upon close examination, are found to contain the element of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we go through more dealings and our scope of obedience increases, we will discern even the rebellion that is hidden in others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle and exercise of submission should be increased all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to come face to face with God's authority at least once before we can submit to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As for the consciousness and sense of rebellion, we do not have to pay too much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we pay attention to this, the less we can deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is like sin; the more we look for it, the more sin we will find.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Avoiding Jokes</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning yourself, I would like to speak concerning the matter of laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me first ask, What is laughing?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why does a man laugh?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He laughs because some things or words are taken out of context; one sentence logically does not follow another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A worker should learn to avoid words and sentences that are taken out of context, that do not follow one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Words that are out of context, words that surprise others, are jokes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let me tell you a true joke that happened in the last century.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>About forty or fifty years after Robert Morrison came to China, a lady missionary hosted a dinner in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She felt that the soup tasted strange and asked the cook for the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The cook said, "There were some sediments in the soup, and I sieved them out."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The missionary asked, "What did you sieve them out with?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The cook answered, "Your socks!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The missionary jumped up and said, "How could you do that?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The cook replied, "Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I did not use your good socks.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I only used your old socks."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The missionary was upset about the spoiled taste of the soup, but the cook was concerned only about the kind of socks that were used.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Laughing always takes away one's spiritual power and effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A person laughs because something has been said out of order or as a surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a sister combs her hair with her hairbrush, no one will laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if she scrubs her clothes with her hairbrush, others will laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If anyone speaks of an ear growing in the middle of the nose, others will laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Anything that is illogical makes people laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A worker should learn not to make others laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He should not say any word or allude to any fact that is out of order or that comes as a surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am not saying that we cannot be funny at all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as we have a strong spirit, we can be funny.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if we want to say something funny, we should say it with the backing of a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This will make the joke acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the spirit is not strong, the joke will become a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the ministry of the word, those who like to joke reduce the weightiness of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Jokes reduce spiritual value and power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In fulfilling the ministry of the word, we should try our best not to make people laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should not induce laughter consciously, and we should not use jokes as a tool in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although spiritual matters sometimes lead to laughing, we should do our best not to stir up laughter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Any action or word that comes as a surprise to others is spiritually damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sometimes the atmosphere is very tense.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At such times it is possible to make a turn by telling a joke to relax the audience a little.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must also add that one should not pay too much attention to refraining from joking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This makes us unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have to exercise some care in the matter of jokes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God does not make all the ministers of the word the same.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should not try to deal with this matter too rigidly, or else our conscience will become overly burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There should always be the proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Dividing of the Spirit and the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should not expect a new believer to separate his spirit from his soul too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Of course, it should not come too slowly either.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is no uniform timing as to the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Some have a big soul, while others have a small soul.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The soul of some carries one characteristic, while the soul of others bears no special characteristic at all and is very common.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Therefore, those who have believed in the Lord for some time may find their souls being different in size.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those with a big soul require great breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those with a strong intellect require strong chastisement before their spirit can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Those with exceptionally strong emotions also need special dealings before they can release their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, one shining may be all that is needed with ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They need the empowering of the spirit more than the breaking of their person.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Those whose soul is not that strong should seek for the empowering of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Dividing of the Inner Man and the Outer Man</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The work of dividing the inner man from the outer man differs in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One with a peculiar disposition must suffer a mortal blow before he will experience this separation.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>First, he needs to receive a deep and painful wound from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Once this occurs, it is easy to solve the other problems.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>At the same time he needs the shining and the cooperation of the environment to experience the separation of the inner man from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>After dividing there is still a need for further dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If one possesses no obvious peculiarity, the dividing of the soul and the spirit may happen unconsciously and gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>At any rate, this separation work is one of the most crucial lessons in the work of the Lord.</S>
