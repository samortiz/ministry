   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY 2 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39 OUTLINE Concerning the small group meeting Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning prophesying 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tonight we will continue with the secret of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First we want to point out two passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is Ephesians 4:11-16.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second is 1 Corinthians 14:1-40.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians throughout the ages have never entered into the experience of these two passages of God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we have never seen the condition described in these two passages being manifested in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>PROPHESYING BEING TO SPEAK FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND TO SPEAK FORTH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Take for example 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Formerly, we thought that this chapter talks about spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of this we did not dive into the depths of this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But recently the Lord has shown us specifically that it is not only on spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it emphasizes and exalts in a particular way the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, many Christians do not understand the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Chinese Union Version, this word is translated as the "preaching of a prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Greek word for prophesying means to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can see a basic principle both from the Old Testament and from the New, which is that God hardly ever spoke to man directly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the most part He reveals things to man through dreams or revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes He has to put a man into an ecstasy before such a one can understand the mind of God Acts 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the other hand, the Bible shows us that in many portions and in many ways, God spoke of old to the fathers in the prophets Heb 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word prophet refers to one who prophesies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When God has something to say, He does not speak directly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He takes a man to be His mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a man then speaks for God and speaks forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we come to the New Testament, the prophets not only speak forth God; they also speak God into people, which means that they dispense Christ into men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When men hear the words, not only do they receive the words, but they receive into them a Person and a Spirit, who is the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, to prophesy is to speak the Lord Jesus into people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians always think that love is the most important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul indeed devoted the whole of chapter thirteen to speaking of different aspects of love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But at the beginning of chapter fourteen, he mentioned three things, which are love, spiritual gifts, and prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of these three things, the spiritual gifts were received by us when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The love is also easily obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the most neglected item is prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The spiritual gifts are the spiritual capabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a child is born, he is endowed with some natural capabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He can cry, and gradually he can see with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After a few months, he can even utter with his mouth, "Papa, mama."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the result of the gradual manifestation of the capabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After this, he begins to crawl and to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This proves that he is a living person, with all the functions of the life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these functions manifest themselves bit by bit as the life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are not saved, regenerated, or you do not have the life of God, you would not have any spiritual gift.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as you are a saved person, you will have spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The life that you received at regeneration is a high life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is even a super life, one that is divine and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Doubtless, it will impart to you spiritual gifts.</S>
