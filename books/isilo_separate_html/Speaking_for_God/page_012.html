Who is Christ? Christ is God; hence, the Word of God is Christ.<h2 class=head2>Being the Spirit</h2><p>Second, the word of God is the Spirit (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17). In John 6 the Lord Jesus told the disciples, &#8220;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit&#8221; (v. 63), and Ephesians 6 says that &#8220;the Spirit...is the word of God&#8221; (v. 17).<h2 class=head2>As Life</h2><p>Third, the word of God is life. John 6 also shows us that the word of God is life. The Lord said, &#8220;The words which I have spoken to you...are life&#8221; (v. 63).<h2 class=head2>As Light</h2><p>Fourth, the word of God is light. In the Old Testament the psalmist praised the Lord for His word, saying, &#8220;Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path&#8221; (Psa. 119:105). This verse is very poetic and was written according to the situation in ancient times. In ancient times there were no electrical street lights, nor were there any other kinds of light on the path. Therefore, when people walked during the night, they had to carry a lamp to illuminate their footsteps. Hence, the psalmist gave this utterance: &#8220;Your word is a lamp to my feet.&#8221; The word of God is a lamp; when a person carries it while walking, it is a lamp to his feet. As such, it becomes the light on his path when he walks. The word of God is our lamp, our light. If we have the word of God, we have the light; if we do not have the word of God, we are in darkness.<h2 class=head2>As Food</h2><p>Fifth, the word of God is our food. In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&#8221; A prophet in the Old Testament also said, &#8220;Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart&#8221; (Jer. 15:16). All those who love the word of the Lord can testify that God&#8217;s words in them are their sweetness and joy.<h2 class=head2>As the Seed</h2><p>Sixth, the word of God is the seed. We know that seeds have life. When we receive the word of God, this word enters into us and becomes a seed of life. At that very moment we are regenerated, within us there is the germination of life. First Peter 1:23 says, &#8220;Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&#8221; Matthew 13:3 says that the Lord went out to sow. The seed which He sowed was the word of God. The Lord&#8217;s sowing is the Lord&#8217;s speaking. What does He speak? He speaks God&#8217;s word; He speaks God Himself. This is the seed of life.<h2 class=head2>As the Rain</h2><p>Seventh, God&#8217;s word is the rain. We know that when a seed is planted into the soil, it cannot grow without the rain. This thought is clearly shown in the Scriptures. Deuteronomy tells us that God&#8217;s speaking is like raindrops upon the plants and vegetables (32:2). Isaiah also said that the word of God descends from heaven and will not return to Him vainly, but rather it is like the rain and the snow which come upon the earth to water the earth and make it bear and sprout forth, so that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater (55:10-11). God&#8217;s word is like the rainwater; for the seed to grow, it still needs to be watered with God&#8217;s word as the rain. It is exceedingly marvelous that the word of God is life and also the seed of life; moreover, it is the rain that waters this seed.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
