   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCEIVED OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BORN OF A VIRGIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first item of the outline says that this wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that whenever we come to the biography of a man, we have to mention his origin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The origin of Jesus Christ is, on the one hand, God, and on the other hand, man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His conception was by the Holy Spirit of God and in the womb of a chaste virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is very difficult to understand and is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the meaning of the Bible, the Holy Spirit of God is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, for Him to be conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of a chaste virgin is to be conceived through the coming of God Himself into a chaste virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Naturally, with this conception there are both the elements of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the Holy Spirit there is the element of God, and with the virgin there is the element of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, this conception produced the One who is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>HAVING BOTH GOD AND MAN AS HIS ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Item number one of the outline continues by saying that He was born with both the nature of God and of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very difficult to understand, yet it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus Christ possesses not only divinity, but also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He possesses both divinity and humanity at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The divinity and humanity refer not only to His nature, but also to His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The essence of Jesus Christ is divinity as well as humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is a God-man, in whom divinity was added to humanity, that is, in whom the essence of God was added to the essence of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, He is the complete God as well as the perfect Man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From God s side He is fully God and from man s side He is truly man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the God-man in whom both God and man are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know that conception is a kind of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How is a conception possible without the mingling?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the conception of Jesus Christ there were two essences: the essence of God and the essence of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two were not just added together; they were mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The One produced from this mingling is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second item of the outline says that the Creator of the universe, the unique God of the heavens and the earth, is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In traditional Christian theology, He is called the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In recent years we have investigated and studied the matter and have found out that the word trinity comes from Latin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The theological expression three persons in one essence in English is derived from Latin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Latin the word used is not person or persons, but persona or personae.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we have a fine distinction in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some authorities say that the word persona in Latin means the mask worn by the actors in a play.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same person would at one time put on the mask of an old man and after a few minutes put on the mask of a child; then a few minutes later he may put on the mask of an old woman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After much studying we cannot agree with this kind of teaching of the trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason we prefer not to use the phrase three persons in one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, we use the term three-one, or triune.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word triune is a proper term in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we cannot find this term in the Bible, there is nonetheless the fact and the description.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The term was invented by students of the Bible for the proper expression of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Theologians throughout the ages have used this term.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a Latin compound word tri-une anglicized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Tri means three and une means one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, triune means three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What does it mean to be triune?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It just means triune.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One cannot explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is exactly what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It cannot be explained.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If it can be explained then it is no longer real and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some have added the word in to read three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But strictly speaking it is not three in one, but three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then what is the meaning of three-one?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have studied much and have read a lot of writings by others with the hope that I could explain the matter more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the end I found out that no one can explain it clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Someone once asked Martin Luther, What is three-one?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He answered: I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If I knew, I would be God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was not God; therefore, he did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not think that we know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not even clear concerning the structure of our own human body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How then can we understand the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the pure Word of God, which is the Bible, shows us that our God is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Following this, item two of the outline says that this Triune God, as the Son coming from and with the Father the word from in John 6:46 carries with it the meaning of with and by the Spirit, became a man of flesh on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This word is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is three, yet He is one God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This God became a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His coming was the Son s coming, but the Son s coming was from and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, the Son s coming brought with Him the Father s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Moreover, this coming is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>John 8:29 shows us clearly that the Father has not only sent the Son; He came with the Son as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Son was never alone on earth; the Father was with Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexists and coinheres in the flesh of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This One is in that One, and the two are in the third One.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The third One is in turn in the first and the second One.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The three coinhere one in another.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In John 14:10 the Lord said, I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me. This word coinherence is a special term used in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The night before last I was in Newton, Massachusetts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I gave a message in English using the word coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One professor in Biblical Greek, a man over sixty years of age, was among the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His textbook on Greek is the second most popular one in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When he heard me using the term coinherence, he was very surprised that an old Chinese would speak about theology in America using the word coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He said that most theologians in America do not use this term anymore because it is too deep and is too difficult to clarify.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But this is a truth in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should not be afraid of difficulty and should not let this word go by easily.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Rather, we should study this word thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We all love the Lord, but we should not love Him in a blind way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We all have to seek after a deep understanding of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The more deeply we know Him, the more thoroughly we will love Him.</S>
