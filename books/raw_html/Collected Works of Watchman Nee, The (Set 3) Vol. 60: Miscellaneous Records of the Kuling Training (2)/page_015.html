<h2 class="head2">The World</h2><p>What is the world? It is the pleasures of sin. When the book of Hebrews speaks of the pleasures of sin, it refers to the enjoyment in Egypt, which is a type of the world (11:25). Many people are afraid that they will have to give up the pleasures and enjoyment of the world once they believe in the Lord. A gospel preacher should show others that even gaining the whole world means nothing if one loses his own life. What can one give in exchange for his own life (Matt. 16:26)? The Lord Jesus gave a wonderful parable in the Gospel of Luke. The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly, so he wanted to build larger barns to gather his wheat and goods. Then he said to his own soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry." God, however, said to him, "Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?" (12:16-20).</p><p>In John 4:13 the Lord said to the Samaritan woman, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." To be thirsty is to be dissatisfied. The Lord's word clearly shows that a man can be satisfied by the world temporarily, but he soon will be dissatisfied. A man can never be fully and constantly satisfied. This is the very nature of the vanity of the world. Every drink in the world makes a person thirsty again. A man can receive something from the world, but this only makes him thirsty for more. The water of this world will never satisfy. It is better to accept the Lord. This kind of presentation can become a key to pry men open and to lead them to the Lord.</p><p>The rich man in Luke 16 made merry every day in splendor, but he suffered in the fire of hell in the end. The world is empty. In speaking about the vanity of the world, you have to use the book of Ecclesiastes. You have to show others that there is indeed nothing worth pursuing in this world. It is most foolish to waste one's years in the vanity of the world. The Lord Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." He also said that He had another kind of water. This is the living water which enters into man and satisfies his thirst. The water that the Lord gives satisfies man in his inner being. Once a man is satisfied inwardly, he will no longer crave outward things. We have to show them that many people who were once empty and thirsty have now realized that their vanity and thirst have turned into satisfaction and joy through receiving the living water of God. This living water of God has satisfied their thirst, and they do not need worldly pleasure any longer.</p><p>It would be difficult to find another woman in this world as evil as the Samaritan woman. She was not satisfied with one husband; she went and picked out another. Not being satisfied again, she went and picked out yet another. In the end she was not satisfied with any of them. She was seeking for satisfaction in the human life. Her switching of husbands was the ultimate symptom of her pursuit of human satisfaction. She first was married to one man, thinking that she would be satisfied. When he did not satisfy her, she changed to another one. This went on five times, and she was still not satisfied. This is exactly what the Lord meant when He said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." She was never satisfied. Every enjoyment of this world only satisfies temporarily; it is never a genuine and eternal satisfaction. There is no satisfied person on this earth, and there is no happy person on this earth. To a woman, a husband is the most secure thing. Yet this woman was not satisfied with her husbands. It goes without saying that nothing else would satisfy her. The world can offer only salt water; a man becomes thirstier after drinking it. Many people indulge themselves in the pleasures and enjoyments of this world, but they are trying to quench their thirst with salt water. Once a man has the Lord, he will be satisfied inwardly, and he will no longer be thirsty.</p><p>If you resolve to take this line of preaching, you should give up trying to do well in everything else. A gospel preacher should not think that he can do everything. If the Lord wants you to take this line, you should honor this line. You should spend time dwelling on this line and developing this line. Each person has to find a line that best suits him; he cannot imitate others. Never waste time on a line that does not suit you; that is a mere waste of energy. In preaching the gospel, the key is not to learn many methods but to get men saved. You have to develop your own specialty. Everyone needs to have his own line. Today the Lord is taking the way of the Body. If we all will coordinate together, we will be able to preach the full gospel of God. Evangelism is a work that belongs to the whole church; no individual can do the job perfectly. We are merely members of the Body. For this reason each of us must have our own specialty. When all the specialties are added together, we have the perfect and full gospel.</p>
