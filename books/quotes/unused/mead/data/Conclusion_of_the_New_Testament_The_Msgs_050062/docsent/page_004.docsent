   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says that Christ "became wisdom to us from God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul does not say that Christ is wisdom to us; he says that Christ became wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that at one time Christ was not wisdom to us but that later He became wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ could not become wisdom to us before we were in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when we believed in Christ, God put us into Him, and then Christ became wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is a transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul composed verse 30 in the way he did in order to indicate to the believers that Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we face certain problems and realize that we do not know how to handle them, we should apply Christ as our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we remain with the Lord to receive His dispensing, He will be transmitted into us as the wisdom to handle various problems and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to apply Christ as wisdom in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wisdom may be understood as the way to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have wisdom, we shall know the proper way to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we are not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to have the best way to do things in our daily life, we must have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as wisdom to the believers is actually the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is equal to the way in John 14:6, a verse where the Lord Jesus says, "I am the way."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's way is His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we enjoy His Christ and participate in Him, we shall have Him as our wisdom, as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How do we receive the wisdom we need?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This wisdom comes from our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do this, we shall enjoy Christ and have Him as our wisdom, as our way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is Christ as wisdom to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 1:30 indicates that Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some of us may think that we have the righteousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of saying that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness, we should say that Christ Himself has become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has made Christ, the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is both our objective and subjective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As our objective righteousness, Christ is the One in whom we are justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Justification is God's action in approving us according to the standard of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Christ as our objective righteousness before God we are justified, approved, by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As our subjective righteousness, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we live this Christ and express Him, He becomes our daily righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, Christ as our subjective righteousness is our life; He is the One whom we live and express as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the surpassing righteousness mentioned in Matthew 5:20.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, objective righteousness is the Christ we received when we believed in Him in order to be justified before God Rom 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Subjective righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As believers we need not only to receive Christ as our righteousness objectively but also to live Him as righteousness subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Christ, who is our righteousness, we have been justified and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But after receiving Christ we need to live Him so that He may become our subjective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This subjective righteousness is Christ lived out of us in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ as our righteousness is for the believers' enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we have Him as our righteousness not only objectively but also subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that when we exercise our spirit to contact Him, we become righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we contact Him and enjoy Him, the more righteous we become in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, by having Christ wrought into us the believers become the very righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
