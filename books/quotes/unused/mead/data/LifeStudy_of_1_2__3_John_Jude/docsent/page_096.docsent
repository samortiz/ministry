   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 22 John goes on to say, And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and practice the things which are pleasing in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Offenses in the conscience of a condemning heart are obstacles to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A conscience void of offense in a tranquil heart straightens and clears the way for our petition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 22 the keeping of the commandments is not the keeping of the commandments of the Mosaic law by our own endeavor and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is rather a part of the believers living as the issue of the divine life that abides in them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the habitual keeping of the Lord s New Testament commandments through the inner operation of the power of the divine life.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No doubt, these things are the living of a life of righteousness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Literally, the Greek word rendered sight means seeing into.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not refer to objective sight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, it refers to the Lord s watching over us and seeing into our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the relationship between us and God is very personal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE COMMANDMENTS TO BELIEVE AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 23 John goes on to say, And this is His commandment, that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a summary of the commandments in the preceding and following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the commandments are summarized in two: one is to believe in the name of God s Son Jesus Christ, and the other is to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first is concerning faith; the second, love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have faith is to receive the divine life in our relationship with the Lord; to love is to live the divine life in our relationship with the brothers.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Gospel of John, faith and love are the two requirements for us to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to receive God and enjoy Him, we need to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also need to love Him and love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ABIDING IN HIM BY LIVING IN THE DIVINE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 24 John concludes, And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This verse is the conclusion of this section, which begins in 2:28, on our abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing, as unfolded in the preceding section 2:20-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This section reveals that abiding in the Lord is the living of the children of God by His eternal life as the divine seed, which grows in practicing the righteousness of their begetting God 2:29; 3:7, 10 and the love of their begetting Father 3:10-11, 14-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such an abiding and its bases the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed are mysterious yet real in the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To keep the commandments of the Lord is to have a life according to the divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we keep the Lord s commandments by living in the divine reality, we shall abide in Him, and He in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We abide in the Lord; then He abides in us.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second part of verse 24 says, And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, the Spirit, that is, the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit, is the vital and crucial factor of all the mysteries unveiled in this Epistle: the divine life, the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the abiding in the Lord, the divine birth, and the divine seed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by this Spirit we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament Gal 3:14 .</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now since the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit is here.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we abide in the Lord and He abides in us by the Spirit whom He has given to us.</S>
