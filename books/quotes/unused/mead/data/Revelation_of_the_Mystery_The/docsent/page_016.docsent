   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE REPRINTING OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To print a book or a newspaper, one needs not only a printing plate but also good paper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose you have made a printing plate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you then try to print something on a piece of glass or on a piece of marble, it will be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only when you use a proper sheet of paper will the ink be immediately absorbed and the print will come out clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What kind of "paper" is used for the reprint of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The "paper" is our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our mind is like a piece of marble.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you try to understand the spiritual things and the things pertaining to the church with your mind, it is like trying to print a newspaper on marble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is very difficult, and there is no absorption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither can you use your emotion, cleverness, zeal, or good intention to understand spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of these ways will do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For more than forty years I have been observing a group of zealous people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more zealous they are, the more God has no way in them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their heart for the church is so good that it is beyond reproach, yet their understanding of the church is so darkened that they hardly know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In short, to allow the Spirit to reprint Himself in us, we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>RECEIVING REVELATION IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are several passages in Ephesians that mention the phrase in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 3:5 says that the church as the mystery of Christ has now been revealed in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Within you and me is a mystery that is not known to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is this mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This mystery is that the Spirit is doing a work of reprinting in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit is reprinting the rich Christ and the mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a reprint cannot be touched by the human mind, human wisdom, or human emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we are in our spirit can the church as a mystery be revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This mystery is something altogether in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we must be in spirit to receive this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 1:17 says that we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A spirit of revelation is for seeing, whereas a spirit of wisdom is for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, suppose there is a machine that had been covered and kept secret but has now been unveiled and exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, one may examine it for a long time and still be puzzled as to its use or purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One may have the revelation but not the wisdom, and one may have the seeing but not the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we all need to pray, "O Lord, give us a spirit that can both see and understand."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be in spirit is to be in a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You and I have a spirit within, but this spirit needs to be strengthened and enlightened by the Spirit of God that it may be able to see and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING BUILT IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church as God's building, God's house, and God's dwelling place is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 2:22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may say that God dwells in us, but strictly speaking, He does not dwell in our mind or in our emotions but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may say that we are being built together in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the building is not in our mind but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our mind is wild, like an unbridled horse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps someone would say to me, "Brother Lee, I am absolutely one with you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of who he might be, I would not believe him or listen to him, because it is useless for someone to merely say that he is one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being in the mind is not useful, but being in the spirit is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you were truly in spirit, you would be one with me without having to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, our being built together as God's dwelling place can take place only in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all have some amount of experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many times we have opinions, but once we are in spirit, the opinions are gone, and there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once we are in spirit, there is the building and the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>BEING STRENGTHENED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Ephesians 3:16 the apostle prayed, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be strengthened, not in our mind or in our joy, anger, sorrow, or delight but in our spirit, in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not be strong in your mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, be strong in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all need to be strengthened in spirit.</S>
