   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE ON ASSUMING HEADSHIP IN THE FAMILY Date: October 15, 1936, afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Amoy SALVATION BEING A MATTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The family occupies a special place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's selection has to do with a nation, and eternal life has to do with individuals, but salvation has to do with the household.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ADAM HAVING LOST HIS HEADSHIP IN THE FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first household mentioned in the Bible is Noah's household.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although Adam had children, the Bible does not mention his household, because after Adam sinned in Genesis 3, he lost his position in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God had appointed Adam to be the head of his family, yet he lost his headship, and the first family was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The brothers are the head of their households.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not enough to be a husband and father; he has to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Genesis 3 Adam lost his place as a husband and a head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there was a family there at all, it was Eve and her family, because Eve became the head there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, this was not according to God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NOAH'S HOUSEHOLD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then God mentioned Noah's household.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those in his household were not particularly better than Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This family consisted of one pair on top and three pairs below.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible does not say much about Noah's wife and the three daughters-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of his three sons, however, one was good, one was partly good, and the third was bad.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question is not whether Noah's sons were good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The question is where Noah stood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With respect to the flood, God only dealt with Noah; He did not mention his wife, sons, or daughters-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Noah represented his whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God said that Noah was just and perfect Gen 6:9 because he was able to assume the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he was saved, his whole household was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The giving of eternal life is to individuals, but the unit of salvation is the household.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a family does not have a head, God deals with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when a family has a head, God deals with the head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are standing in the position of a head, God only needs to deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is an interesting thing that God divides the world into families.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today man has damaged God's arrangement the family has been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the situation today?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Families are filled with rebellion sons rebel against the father's authority, the wife rebels against the husband's authority, and servants rebel against the master's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The family is broken and the oneness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the head does not stand firm as the head, the institution of the family is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for a family to please the Lord, the head must stand firm in his position as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a family does not have a head, God can only deal with each individual in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Noah's household was the first family that God dealt with as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God dealt with Noah's household in a different way than other households because Noah was able to assume the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What his wife and daughters-in-law did was an entirely different issue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Noah was able to assume the headship; he did not break down the institution of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I dare not say that the other seven had not sinned, but I can say that his family was not damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone was under the authority of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why the whole household was saved even though God only called Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not understand this, we cannot understand the meaning of Acts 16:31, which says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we read this verse, individual faith and individual salvation come to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Very often we change the unit and the numbers when our theology clashes with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We consider something to be a heresy when it is actually God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, God's Word is very clear here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God grants salvation household by household.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, there must be a proper head to receive this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without a proper head, there cannot be household salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When a proper head is absent, the institution of the family is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the wife, children, and daughters-in-law submit to the authority of the head of the house, the house will be saved.</S>
