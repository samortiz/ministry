   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE THE TRIUNE GOD AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR REGENERATED HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Romans 8 there are eleven positive items which may be considered as the components of the spiritual leading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we experience these eleven items, we are sons of God led by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually these eleven items may be divided into three groups of three items each plus two other items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first group is the group of the law which is composed of the law, the Spirit, and life v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second group is the group of our regenerated and mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This group contains the human spirit, the things of the Spirit, and the mind set on the spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third group is the group of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit of God no doubt refers to the Spirit of the Father v. 9 . The Spirit of Christ, of course, refers to the Spirit of the Son v. 9 . The Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead should be the Spirit in the Godhead v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So there are three groups: the group of the law, the group of the mingled spirit, and the group of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we live by these three groups we have a tenth item, peace v. 6 . Peace is a condition we have by living in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is also a result, the sons of God v. 14 . The condition of such a living is peace, and the result is the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually these eleven items do not refer to a very complicated, confused, and mixed-up situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, they reveal to us a simple life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life is always simple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you study it, it seems complicated, but when you live it, it is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To understand our physical body is very complicated, but simply to live in our physical body is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even little children who don t know very much can live quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8 is a thorough study of our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No other chapter in the New Testament reveals the spiritual life so much in detail as Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spiritual life is just a life filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Romans 8 the Triune God is referred to repeatedly in different ways and in different manners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even the law of the Spirit of life implies the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE GROUP OF THE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the last group, the group of the Trinity, the title, the Father, is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Spirit is used three times: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This threefold mention of the Spirit surely indicates strongly the Trinity of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even in the sequence you can see the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why is the Spirit of Christ not mentioned first?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why is it mentioned in the middle of the three?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Firstly is the Spirit of God, referring to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Secondly is the Spirit of Christ, referring to Christ the Son, and thirdly is the Spirit of the One, referring to the Spirit of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE GROUP OF OUR MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a life filled with the Triune God is one that is lived through our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This brings us to the second group.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second group is the group of our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this group there is our human spirit mingled with the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then there are the things of the Spirit, that is, the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The things of the mingled spirit are the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The mind set on the spirit is a mind which is minding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in the Bible you have such a term as the mind of Christ 1 Cor 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By this you could see that the Trinity is wrapped up with our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And the things of such a Spirit are the things of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The mind set on such a spirit is the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE GENUINE AND PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The spiritual life or the Christian life is just one filled with the Triune God, and it is one wrapped up with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of teaching is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is just the believers and God living together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 8:1-14 doesn t touch other items such as holiness or victory or humility or kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a sense these are trivial matters in the spiritual field.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, this chapter reveals to us that a genuine and proper Christian life is just one filled with the Triune God who is wrapped up with our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you take care of these two points you are under the leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You know you are under the leading by the Spirit because you have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you have a life filled with the Triune God who is wrapped up with your spirit, you have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Anytime and anywhere, under any kind of situation, you have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By this peace you know that you are living with the Triune God, and you are under the leading by the Spirit.</S>
