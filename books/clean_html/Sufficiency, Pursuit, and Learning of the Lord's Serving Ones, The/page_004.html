<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM<br />
BEING DISCOURAGED AND BEING PROUD</h2>
<p>There is a seed within us, which is our faith. The Lord said that our faith needs to be only the size of a mustard seed. Our faith is the capital for our service. We need to serve the Lord with our faith. We should not be concerned with our weaknesses or our inabilities. Whether or not we have insight, can speak eloquently, or can remember the verses in the Bible should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Every person who is chosen by the Lord has faith. The problem that the Lord&rsquo;s servants face is that they are either discouraged or proud. We are either discouraged and say that we cannot see, cannot remember, and cannot speak clearly, or we are proud and say that we can see, can remember, and can speak. Luke 17 shows how we can be delivered from these two problems. We should not be discouraged, for the Lord has put faith, our capital, within us. This faith cannot be removed and enables us to serve Him. Hence, we can preach the gospel and can shepherd the saints.</p>
<p>However, when we are able to preach the gospel or shepherd the saints, we must guard against pride. We should never say that since we can do these things, we deserve to be rewarded. The Lord said that we should humble ourselves, that is, come before Him and serve Him. The Lord should be the first to be satisfied. We must stand before Him and say, &ldquo;We are unprofitable slaves.&rdquo; The Lord does not like to hear us say that we are faithless slaves. He likes to hear us say that we are unprofitable slaves. The Lord also likes to hear us say that we have faith, not that we do not have faith. He likes to hear us say that we are unprofitable slaves who preach the gospel and shepherd the saints because it is our service. If we remember that we are people of faith, we will not be discouraged; we will be able to stand. If we remember that we are unprofitable slaves, we will not be proud. We should continually be before the Lord in relation to His words in these verses.</p>
<p>We should not lose heart, nor should we envy others in their service. Not every serving one can be like the apostle Paul. There were many apostles, but there was only one Paul. Silas and Timothy were both very good, but they could not write the Epistles that Paul wrote. Therefore, as long as we have faith, we should not lose heart. Even though our faith is small, it is enough capital for our service. Furthermore, we must remember that we are unprofitable slaves and should be humble. We have received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy; hence, we should not take credit for preaching the gospel or shepherding the saints. Rather, we must continue to serve the Lord. The Lord must be satisfied first. We are unprofitable slaves, who have done what we should do. This must be our realization.</p>
<p>During my recent recuperation from an illness, I considered the condition of the serving ones. Some serving ones are discouraged, but others are self-contented and proud. One serving one told me that he has seen a vision and received a clear burden and that he always receives revelation when he reads the Bible. Upon hearing these words, I was concerned. I fear that one day problems may arise among us. We have a sickness because some of us are discouraged, but others are proud.</p>
<p>We decided that when the co-workers come together, we will seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and fellowship concerning different situations. We must be brave and fierce in order to fight the spiritual warfare. We must also strive to bear the burden and not be afraid of sufferings. When we fellowship, our spirit should be keen, and we should open to one another in order to be balanced and corrected by others. A brother should say that he is not sure how the others feel about a situation. He should say that he has a feeling, but it may be from his natural man; hence, he is seeking to be balanced in fellowship. Among us there should be a situation of open fellowship.</p>
<p>It is not right for us to be discouraged or to be proud. Those who are discouraged are comparing themselves with others. If we have learned the lesson, we would not be in our feelings. When a brother releases the light that he has received, we would not compare ourselves with him. Rather, we would thank the Lord for raising up such a brother among us. A number of brothers are discouraged because they compare themselves with those who are successful in the work, receive light from the Bible, shepherd the saints, or give messages. There is also a number of brothers who say that that they are able to preach the gospel and shepherd the saints. They also say that they have a vision and that they can succeed when others fail. This kind of talk exposes their heart. They have unconsciously fallen into pride.</p>
<p>Some serving ones are discouraged because they have been asking the Lord to increase their faith, but the Lord has not answered their prayer. Even though many years have passed, they have not been able to get through in their Bible reading, and they have not received any burden directly from the Lord. The Lord says that it is sufficient for our faith to be the size of a little mustard seed. We must forget our feelings and not compare ourselves with others. If it were not for our small faith that upholds and maintains us, many co-workers would have fallen down discouraged. The co-workers often do not rise up in the work, because they are disheartened. There are also co-workers who consider themselves capable of administrating the church, preaching the gospel, and shepherding the saints. They do not acknowledge that they are unprofitable slaves. We lack the spirit of humility. Those whose functions are not manifested are discouraged, but those whose functions are manifested are self-contented. May the Lord have mercy on us. We do not want to fall into either of these two categories.</p>
<p>No matter how many things we accomplish, we still must admit that it is by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and that it is He who has blessed us and led us. Furthermore, we must also acknowledge that there are many things that we have not accomplished. We should realize that even if the blessing we received from the Lord were doubled, we still would not have done enough. There is nothing that we can boast of. We must prostrate ourselves before the Lord and say that we are unprofitable slaves. There is no limit to the progress we can make in regard to visions, burdens, light, reading the Bible, spiritual knowledge, leading the church, or preaching the gospel. Hence, no one can say that he has reached the peak and can go no further. We should humble ourselves. We should not be discouraged, nor should we be proud.</p>
