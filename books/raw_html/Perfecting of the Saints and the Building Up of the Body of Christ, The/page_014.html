<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for gathering us together into Your name once more. How we treasure this gathering together. May You be with every one of us here. We long after Your word. May You in Your word dispense Yourself into us once more. Every one of us here needs You. Grant every one of us grace that we may receive Your word and may enjoy the riches hidden in Your word. Lord, remove the hindrances, the veils, and the shadows between You and us. Open up to us Your heart&rsquo;s desire, and show us Your way that we may see what You are after today. Lord, we hate the evil one; we hate the enemy. While we are fighting the battle for You here, do fight for us. You are the Captain that leads us on. Dispel all the power of darkness, and shame Your enemy. May You gain the glory among us. We stand on Your victory and declare Your victory, and we bind the evil one, Satan, by Your victorious name. Lord, deal with Your enemy, release those who love You, and release Your riches. Amen!</p>
<p>After four years of studying and experimenting, and through a lot of work and at a great price, we have come to a fairly clear and definite conclusion today. The conclusion is very simple. It entails the life and service of the new way. We are going to cover this matter in this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE IN THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Revived Every Morning</h2>
<p>The life in the new way is the normal Christian life, which is a life of being revived every morning and overcoming every day. Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.&rdquo; Dawn is the time when the daylight just begins to break and before the sun actually rises from the east. The Christian pathway is not one of sunset but one like the dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. From morning until noon is an upward path. As Christians we only have mornings; we do not have afternoons.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s law in nature is that with every twenty-four hours there is a dawning. The dawn brings a new beginning and a new sunrise to every creature. This is the same with the spiritual life of a Christian. Every morning there should be a rising up and a dawning. In 1960 I gave a message on the law of revival. At that time I did not apply the light of the dawn to the subject. Today we see that the Christian life should have a dawn and a new beginning every twenty-four hours. Perhaps you fail miserably today. Nevertheless you can confess your sins to the Lord and can ask for the cleansing of the blood. Tomorrow, you can have a new beginning before the Lord. For this reason a Christian should go to bed early and get up early. When the sun rises in the morning, we should rise up together with it. We should not wait until eight o&rsquo;clock before we rise. We should rise before six o&rsquo;clock, preferably around five o&rsquo;clock. Even the Chinese sages of old exhort people to rise immediately at daybreak. They also say that the plan of the day begins in the morning. This is very reasonable. We Christians are the most proper people on earth. We should live the most proper kind of life. The most proper life is one that follows the sun. When the day breaks, we rise. The first thing we do when we rise is not to be busy with so many things, but to contact the Lord and to pray-read two or three verses of the Bible and to digest them into us.</p>
<p>Lamentations 3:22-24 says, &ldquo;The steadfast love of the Lord...his mercies...are new every morning...The Lord is my portion...therefore I will hope in him.&rdquo; Jeremiah was a weeping prophet. There was nothing in his circumstances that could make him happy. At that time the Israelites had backslidden and become desolate. Their nation had fallen, and they themselves were taken into captivity. He was even among the ones taken into captivity. He wrote these five chapters of lamentations purposely for this. But in his lamentations there is such a portion, whose content is not a lamentation but a song of joy. It is a song of joy in the midst of songs of sorrow. He experienced the whole Jehovah God as his portion. This passage clearly tells us that Jehovah God is our portion. He has become our enjoyment in His love and mercies. He is full of love. And when our situation is too poor for His love, there are His mercies. These are new every morning. For this reason we must lay hold of every morning to rise to receive His new mercies.</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for many years. More and more I have come to realize that I need God&rsquo;s mercies. Many times we become old and backslidden and are not worthy to enjoy God&rsquo;s love. At these times, we still have God&rsquo;s mercies. When you were just saved, you felt good and excited; but after two months, perhaps you started feeling old. It was not the dawn anymore; but, instead, you were at your sunset. In these times you should know that there is still a dawn waiting for you. In this dawn there are God&rsquo;s mercies. The mercies of God are new every morning. This newness indicates that we who love God and seek after Him should have a new beginning every morning to enjoy the Lord as our rich breakfast.</p>
<p>All the physical things in nature have their spiritual significance. For the health of our bodies, we need to eat a good breakfast. In the same way, for our spirit, we need to have the best spiritual breakfast. When we wake up in the morning, we should call on the Lord. The first thing we should think about is the Lord. After that we should enjoy some of the Lord&rsquo;s words. The writer of Psalm 119 says, &ldquo;I rise before dawn and cry for help; I hope in thy words. My eyes are awake before the watches of the night, that I may meditate upon thy promise&rdquo; (vv. 147-148). One usually meditates and thinks with his eyes closed. Why then does it say here that the eyes are awake? We can understand this from our experience. If we want to meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must open our eyes, otherwise it is easy for us to fall asleep. This shows us that we have to struggle to rise early. It is not an easy thing to get up early. The bed is most lovable at five or six o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It has a strong adhesive power to keep us there. On the other hand, after ten o&rsquo;clock at night the bed seems the most hateful; no one wants to go to bed early. But anyone who goes to bed late and gets up late is not healthy and will not be strong spiritually. Today if we want to live in the new way, we must rise at the dawn of the day, and we should wake up before the watches of the night to do nothing else but call on the Lord and hope and meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s words. Hence, to practice the new way, we must be ones that rise early. It is not that easy for one who does not have morning watch to take the new way.</p>
