<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING HIDDEN IN THE GOD WHO CREATED ALL THINGS</h2><p>The ancient saints and the past sages throughout history have no answer to the questions: What is the purpose of God in creating the heavens and the earth? Why did He create mankind? Some people may ask, “Are we too much in saying this?” We are not too much in saying this. We do have the scriptural basis. Both Ephesians and Colossians tell us clearly that God has a hidden mystery. We all know that a mystery is something that is not manifested or made known to others. For example, when a speaker is standing at the podium, we know that he is going to preach and speak. However, if he keeps his mouth shut while he is standing there, we have the sense that he is a mystery. We cannot hear anything from him; we can only see him standing there with his mouth shut. This is his mystery.<p>Our God also has a mystery. This phrase, the mystery of God, is found in Colossians 2:2. Ephesians also tells us that this mystery is one that was hidden in God (3:9). God hid this mystery in Himself and did not tell anyone about it. Moreover, this God who hid the mystery in Himself is the God who created all things. Hence, this mystery was hidden in God, who created all things. This is recorded in Ephesians 3. In reading the Bible, most people can easily find speaking concerning things like humility, patience, and peace, but they cannot easily see the speaking concerning the mystery of God. Ephesians 3:9 says, “And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.” Please notice that this mystery was hidden in God and that He is the One who created all things. Thus, this mystery was hidden in God, who created all things.<p>Verses 3 through 5 read, “That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief, by which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.” This reveals that God had a mystery. Although He created all things and man, He did not tell man of this mystery. It was not until the New Testament, when the apostles and prophets came, that He revealed it to them. These prophets were not of the Old Testament but of the New Testament. Although they knew that all things were created by God, they did not know God’s purpose for creating all things.<p>Even in the New Testament age there are still many people who do not know why God created the heavens, the earth, and man. Until this day it is still a mystery to many people. Although they have their religious thoughts, concepts, and living, and although they also worship and serve God, their service is not something of revelation but is something of religion. They are completely ignorant of God’s purpose. What is man? Why does God save man? Is His intention merely for man to enjoy peace today and go to heaven in the future? All these thoughts are religious concepts. Please bear in mind that God does not save us merely for us to enjoy peace; rather, He saves us for a purpose hidden in Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING CHRIST</h2><p>There is indeed a mystery hidden in God. For example, why did God create the universe? Why did He create mankind? Why did He create all things? Initially, He did not tell anyone about all these things. God hid this purpose in Himself, so it became a mystery. He created the heavens, yet the angels in the heavens did not know why He did it. He created the earth, yet the people on the earth also did not know why He did it. Throughout the ages there were many prophets, but He never told any of them the purpose of His works; He never told anyone. Then what is this mystery? What is the purpose of God? Colossians 2:2 tells us, “The mystery of God, Christ.” God’s purpose is Christ. God created the universe for Christ. God created mankind for Christ. God created everything for Christ. Everything of God is for Christ.<p>Today God is still working because He has not yet obtained His purpose. When all things are headed up in Christ, then the work of God will be fully accomplished. Ephesians 1:10 says, “Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.” This word says clearly that at the fullness of the times all things will be headed up in Christ. It is because all things are for Christ that God created the universe, it is because all things are for Christ that God created man, and it is because all things are for Christ that God created everything. God’s purpose is for Christ, and God’s purpose is Christ. Hence, the mystery of God is certainly Christ.
