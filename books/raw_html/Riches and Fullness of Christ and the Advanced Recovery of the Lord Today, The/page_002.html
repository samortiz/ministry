This time, I see many new faces. I am especially overjoyed to see that the majority of you are young people. My burden this time is mainly in three areas. The first concerns Christ, the second concerns the church, and the third concerns the Lord’s present recovery. These are the main points of this conference: Christ, the church, and the Lord’s recovery. These three points are not God’s recovery of yesterday. Rather, they are the Lord’s present recovery.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS AND UNLIMITEDNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is the specific and central theme of the Bible. According to the revelation of the Old and New Testaments, Christ is too deep, too high, too wide, and too broad. We can never exhaust speaking about Him, nor can we measure Him. Usually, when we talk about Christ, we make Him too common. We say that “Christ is loving,’’ “Christ is merciful,’’ “Christ is forgiving,’’ and “Christ is patient.’’ But all these descriptions are too shallow and common. The terms used by the Bible to describe Christ are all very profound. For this reason, man tends to neglect them.<p>Today we want to see all of the riches of Christ. The first item of these riches is the all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ. His all-inclusiveness speaks of His content, and the unlimitedness speaks of His measure. As far as His content is concerned, He is everything. There is not one thing that He is not. For this reason, He has a special title: the “I Am’’ (Exo. 3:14). If there is a God in the universe, then surely He has to be the one (Rom. 9:5). If there is a man in the universe, surely He is man also (1 Tim. 2:5). He is everything. He is even you and I. He is even every person who is in the churches (Col. 3:11). His content is all-inclusive.<p>In addition, His measure is unlimited. It is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe (Eph. 3:18). When man landed on the moon, he reached a certain height. But the moon is only a part of the solar system. The universe is billions and billions of times larger than the solar system. Since Christ can be compared to the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe, His measure must necessarily be unlimited.
