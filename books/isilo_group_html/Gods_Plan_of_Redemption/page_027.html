It is true that we have a measure of the Holy Spirit when we are regenerated, for one cannot be &#8220;born again&#8221; without the Spirit of God; but that is not knowing Him in His fullness. A simple illustration may help us to see this: Suppose we see a stretch of marshy land full of pools of stagnant water, emitting noisome odors and vapors. Right above it is a beautiful lake, full of clear, sparkling water. As we look at this beautiful water, we think of the transformation which would be realized if it could flow over the waste land below; but a dam of solid masonry effectually prevents this. However, one day as we pass by we discover that the flashboard of the dam has been raised, and now a stream of the clear, life-giving water is flowing over the marshy land below. Already a great change has been effected, but there still remain unsightly, muddy pools on either side of the stream of pure water, and involuntarily we exclaim, &#8220;Oh, if the water would come down and flood all this place, how beautiful it would then appear.&#8221; A little later, we pass by again, and lo, what a transformation! Someone has raised the floodgate of the dam and the water is pouring down, rapidly covering the entire stretch of marshy land, until all the muddy pools of stagnant water are covered and all that we can see is the pure, sparkling water of the lake. When we are &#8220;born again&#8221; (regenerated), it is like the raising of the flashboard. The Life of God through the Holy Spirit comes into our spirit, making us indeed new creatures in Christ Jesus; but oh, what a circumference of our being remains practically untouched by this Life. When we definitely yield to the infilling and control of the Holy Spirit, saying to Him, &#8220;I choose to let Thee transform me to the Image of Christ, at any cost,&#8221; then we realize that the Eternal Spirit is manifesting Himself within our being in a new way, which may be likened to the opening of the floodgate. (from Identification)<p>To symbolize the results of this second crisis of appropriation, the teacher may place over the small gilt disc which has been fastened to the black disc containing the three circles &#8220;spirit,&#8221; &#8220;soul,&#8221; &#8220;body,&#8221; a slightly larger gilt disc with eight (or more) rays extending in various directions, the points barely touching the circle symbolizing the body. (<a class="text" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/fig11.html" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'name','700','550','yes');return false;">See Fig. 11.</a>) A still larger symbol, of the same shape, may be added later to illustrate the progressive stages of Transformation, if desired. And if a gilt disc containing the three circles symbolizing spirit, soul and body, could be held over this partly covered black disc, it would symbolize the future Glorification of the believer.

One who has seen much fanaticism and suffering as the result of such teaching has written the following suggestions which may be helpful to the members of the class:<p class=indent1>It matters little what outward manifestations may accompany the sweeping of God&#8217;s Presence through &#8220;all the rooms of the house,&#8221; or whether there is any manifestation at all. The redeemed one simply knows that &#8220;The Lord is in His Holy Temple,&#8221; and that henceforth He will cleanse and purify and manifest Himself as He chooses....This second definite step is called by various names according to the individual perspective of the various teachers. Some call it the &#8220;Second Blessing&#8221;; others, the &#8220;Blessing of Sanctification&#8221;; while others speak of it as the &#8220;Baptism of the Holy Spirit&#8221;; and it is also set forth as the &#8220;Blessing of a Clean Heart,&#8221; &#8220;Perfect Love,&#8221; &#8220;The Anointing,&#8221; &#8220;Pentecost,&#8221; etc. While all these terms are in a measure descriptive of this second plane of appropriation of Christ&#8217;s Redemptive Work, perhaps no one term adequately expresses all the truth concerning the same; therefore, it is unwise to insist dogmatically upon the acceptance of any particular term as essential to the truth which the Holy Spirit reveals at this stage of the Christian life. Great simplicity in teaching is needed, lest in our presentation of the truth concerning this experience, unconsciously we permit the naming of the experience to become more prominent than the experience itself. Not the naming, but the yielding, is the essential thing. If the regenerated person has intelligently, definitely, irrevocably, yielded to the complete control of the Holy Spirit, he is thereafter identified with Christ in His Anointing-His Fullness of the Holy Spirit; and as a result, he will be led step by step into the experimental knowledge of the Cross of Calvary and the power of the Resurrection Life.<p class=indent1>While the inward results of abandonment to the control of the Holy Spirit are the same in all persons, the outward manifestations vary according to temperament and training. The immediate results outwardly need to be carefully watched, as the temptations of Satan are very subtle at this point. In nearly all cases, the emotions, whose duty it is to send telegrams back and forth between the &#8220;inner&#8221; and the &#8220;outer&#8221; man, are quickly affected by the new order of things, and before the intellect can clearly act, the body is called upon to give expression to the demands of the emotions. It is owing to this fact that we see many persons manifesting their joy by singing, praising God, clapping of hands, etc., while in others we see the cessation of usual bodily movements and great stillness of the whole being, while the countenance expresses holy awe and worship. These manifestations, and others which might be named, are legitimate and should not be criticized or checked; but sometimes manifestations are to be seen which are not natural but are the result of supernatural power of an evil kind. Satan seeks to imitate the Holy Spirit and to produce manifestations which he would have the person believe to be of God. This is for the purpose of causing confusion in the mind of the Christian so that the work of transformation may be hindered and the conduct of the Christian may become such as will bring the truth into discredit and disrepute.<p class=indent1>There is great need of quiet listening to God&#8217;s voice in the depth of the being and a knowledge of God&#8217;s Written Word when the emotions are unusually excited. Remember that the Holy Spirit, who inspired the words, &#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order,&#8221; never leads one to do what is unseemly or unnecessary. Bearing this in mind, we should test the physical manifestations which we experience, or see in others. As a result, we may find that many manifestations which we thought to be of the Holy Spirit are of a psychical nature, and thus instead of proving our exalted spiritual condition, they indicate our lack of complete yieldedness in the circumference of our being. And if through wilfulness we permit these manifestations to continue, we may open the door to evil spirits who will cause manifestations which will produce most disastrous results.<p class=indent1>As the Holy Spirit sheds light upon these manifestations, we are led to see that undue shaking or jerking of the body, long continued prostrations of the body, and other manifestations that might be named, always indicate that the true, deep Life of God, the Holy Spirit, has not permeated the entire circumference of the being. Normal prostration, that is, prostration which contains no element of the abnormal or evil supernatural, comes to a great sinner as the result of conviction of sin, or to worthy saints in consequence of great revelations, but it is not long continued. As examples under the latter head, we read of Daniel, Ezekiel, John. If we bear in mind that the Holy Spirit enters the spirit of man, then permeates and controls his powers of soul, and then brings his bodily powers into subjection, so that the entire being is experimentally at God&#8217;s disposal, we shall be able to understand that unnecessary outward manifestations indicate fanatical or immature Christians. The ripe saint is the quiet, well poised, Spirit-controlled person.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Plan of Redemption &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
