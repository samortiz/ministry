   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST 2 Date: August 5, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Rom 7:17, 20; 6:6, 11</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last night we saw that there are four aspects to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, there is the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ died for us so that we could escape death; this is for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, there is crucifixion, which deals with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, there is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was crucified so that man could receive life; through death He released life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fourth, there is the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is for dealing with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood is for forgiveness; crucifixion is for dealing with sin; the flesh is for life; and bearing the cross is for dealing with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These aspects of the death of Christ secure a complete salvation for man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Last night we saw how the blood accomplished redemption before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tonight we will see how crucifixion deals with sin, that is, how it deals with the indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This touches our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SINS BEFORE GOD AND SIN WITHIN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Scriptures show us two kinds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One is before God, and the other is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first is plural in the original Greek, while the second is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The many sins that are before God are the sins we have committed; they can be counted item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The indwelling sin is a kind of power that urges man to sin and to perform many sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must differentiate between the sins that are before God and the sin that is within man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>David said, "Against You and You alone have I sinned" Psa 51:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, Paul referred to the "sin that dwells in me" Rom 7:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This sin is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since there are two aspects of sin in the Scriptures, there must also be two aspects of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sins before God are dealt with by the blood, while the sin in us is dealt with by another method.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us consider the difference between the sins before God and the sin within man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a little child does not want to go to bed early.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every night he wants to play until ten o'clock before going to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At first his parents do not say much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But as his health continues to deteriorate, his parents decide that he must go to bed at eight o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When eight o'clock comes, he can no longer be outside or play because his parents have given him an order.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, once he enters his bedroom and closes the door, he continues to play until ten o'clock before going to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before his parents gave the order, he was not sinful in their eyes if he did not go to bed on time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But after his parents gave the order, in their eyes he is guilty of the sin of disobedience if he does not go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This sin issues from the fact that in his heart he does not like to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This may continue for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every evening the child goes to his room at eight o'clock and plays until ten o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At first his parents are not aware of this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after awhile, they notice that he is still very tired.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So after he goes into his room, the parents watch outside the room and discover that he is still not in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The next morning his parents rebuke him, and the child confesses his wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His parents forgive him and ask him to go to bed on time again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His sin before his parents is forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But has the heart of the little child changed?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is he going to bed early?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After eight o'clock the little child will still sigh and moan in bed because he still does not like to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please remember that the forgiveness of sins does not make you a good or sinless person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A proud person may know that pride is sin and may ask God for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But forgiveness alone will not necessarily make him humble.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is like a person who habitually borrows money.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He keeps on borrowing until he owes millions of dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A good friend of his may come along and offer to pay off all the debts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But after his debts are paid off, will he stop borrowing?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the impulse rises up, he will borrow just as before.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although the outward sins are forgiven, the inward sin still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Temper is a common malady among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a Christian loses his temper, he knows he is wrong and he readily asks God for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But will he become patient just because God has forgiven him for his temper?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He may be patient once, twice, or three times, but eventually he will not be able to contain his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Outward sins are forgiven through the Lord's blood, but the inward sin is still a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It still requires deliverance, and it still needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If it is not dealt with, we will end up no better than the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even though we are saved and regenerated, we will lose our temper just like an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>An unbeliever has anxiety, and we also will have anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>An unbeliever has pride, and we also will have pride.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There will no difference between us and the rest of the world.</S>
