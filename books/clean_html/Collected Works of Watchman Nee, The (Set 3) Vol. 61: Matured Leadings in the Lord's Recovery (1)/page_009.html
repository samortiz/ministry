<p>Watchman Nee: The few of you in Hong Kong bear a great responsibility. I would like to mention one thing about the meetings in Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong: The atmosphere in these places is wrong. It has never been right. The meeting in Amoy is a little better. Sometimes the atmosphere is right, and sometimes it is wrong. Whenever I passed through the above three places, the atmosphere always was wrong. The co-workers in Hong Kong have to bear the responsibility for turning around the atmosphere. In Hong Kong the atmosphere makes everything cheap; no one pays much attention to spiritual things. A spiritual thing may be very precious in another place, but in Hong Kong, it becomes cheap. This despising attitude gives me a serious doubt as to your knowledge of the spiritual atmosphere among you.</p><p>What is an atmosphere? One sister came to Kuling last year. This year she came again. She said, "I feel that God is very near to me in Kuling. The spiritual things are very weighty and precious here. But once I return to my own locality, I no longer feel that God is so near to me, and the spiritual things are not as precious. Since I am back in Kuling, I sense the nearness of God and the seriousness of spiritual things once more." Brother Kaung is here. Please forgive me for saying a frank word. The work in all of south China is somewhat frivolous. Man's natural tendency is to be frivolous. For this reason you should not be loose. You should not do anything to encourage others in the direction of frivolity. If you cannot do this, you will find as you work in Southeast Asia and in Hong Kong that you may serve others with a bowl of bitter herbs, but they will not feel that they are bitter at all. They may even think that you are serving them a dessert. If a man is not serious about spiritual things, he will destroy what you have built up the minute you leave the place.</p><p>One Shanghai brother returned from Hong Kong to Shanghai and said, "Our brothers in Hong Kong are somewhat like members of the YMCA." This may be too much, but it does speak somewhat of the tendency of that place. We are Christians in Christ, and we have to maintain our distinctive characteristics; we must not pick up the local flavor. Rather, we have to overcome it. We have to take the strict way. We should not make others feel that we are basically the same as them. We have a few brothers here who are very good brothers. As long as we can bring them into a proper spiritual atmosphere, all problems will be solved. In order to have a spiritual atmosphere, we have to bear a heavy responsibility. The co-workers must come together to pray at least two or three times a day. We should not be loose. Study the Word together in one accord. If the fellowship among the brothers is lacking, we cannot expect the ministry of the word to be strong.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO WORK&mdash;PERFECTING OTHERS</h2><p>In conclusion, the basic need of the work in Hong Kong is for the co-workers to come together more to pray and to study the Word. Next, they need to produce men and perfect them. In addition to the regular church meetings, we have to pick out three to five relatively mature ones among the brothers and sisters. Every week we have to be with them for three to five times to cultivate and perfect them. We have to spend the time to perfect them one by one. This means that, in addition to the church meetings, we have to produce men to do the same things that we are doing. The Lord Jesus is our good pattern. He did not set up any church Himself; He only produced twelve men, and then later seventy others, to do the work of preaching. Eventually, one hundred twenty people were perfected. These ones brought in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in one accord at Pentecost. The church was produced, and in a short time, three thousand and then five thousand more were gained.</p><p>In perfecting others we have to pay attention to sanctifying ourselves. In three months' time we will see that all the ones we are perfecting will be just like us.</p><p>Whatever our work may be, the same requirement applies to the person doing the work. We have to be strict and disciplined. This is the only way we can produce anything. We have to be strict in everything. Otherwise, there will be no hope for our future. The book of Matthew has twenty-eight chapters which basically speak of how to be a disciple. We have to do our best to learn to be a disciple.</p><h2 class="head1">INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITATION</h2><p>Visitation is an important work. In visiting others, we should not talk about our family affairs, much less the family affairs of those we are visiting. It may not be that damaging if they bring up such things and we merely listen. But if we talk about such things, this will not bring in any profit, either to us or to them. We are not making visitations like social workers in the YMCA. We visit men as servants of the Lord. We should not speak about worldly things, but instead, we should give them spiritual food. Perhaps we should sit down to read the Word with them or pray with them. After I was saved, a brother frequently came to see me. Every time he came he read a chapter of the Bible with me, and then he gave me a word of encouragement and exhortation. This stirred up my interest for the Word. If anyone is hurt by anything, we can do our best to render him some help, but we should avoid social visitations. The church is a place with enough gossip already. If we add more, we will easily ruin its spiritual life.</p><p>In visiting others, we should never try to answer their spiritual questions too quickly. The purpose of visitation is not to solve spiritual problems. Do not go with the intention of expounding the Bible. If you are not sure of certain things, just say in a simple way that you do not know. You should ask the others to go to the Lord more and seek light and revelation. Give them a spiritual touch.</p><p>It is better to visit in coordination with a few. If we cannot find a partner, we can still go alone, but we have to be on the alert that we are bringing men to the Lord all the time.</p>
