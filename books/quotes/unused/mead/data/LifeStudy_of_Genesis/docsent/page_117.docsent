   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The Significance of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The significance of the woman is that she represents man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the life-study message on Romans 7 we pointed out that Isaiah 54:5 says, "For thy Maker is thine husband."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the unique, universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether we are males or females we are all a part of His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's position is not the position of the husband; it is the position of a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The headship is with God, not with us, not even with the men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before God, the position of the brothers is the same as that of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both sisters and brothers are females in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 The Position of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is our Husband and our Head, and we must always keep ourselves under His covering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The woman must cover her head and never assume the headship 1 Cor 11:3, 5, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since God is our Head we should always turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the Lord's mercy, I have learned of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I had been Eve in the garden and the Devil had come to me, I would not even have looked at him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would have turned to my husband and hidden myself behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would have let Adam be the head and let him exercise his headship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then there would have been no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 The Failure of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The failure of the woman consisted in being over the man and assuming the headship cf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 Tim 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This failure on Eve's part typifies man's assuming the headship and signifies his being over God and putting God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This same principle operates today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we act on our own, putting the Lord aside, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we try on our own to be victorious, that very effort is a defeat because it keeps us away from our husband, our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never do anything by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To try to do anything by yourself means that you are assuming the headship and forgetting your position as a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should be wise and never take the position of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eve in the garden was our representative.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nearly all of us on occasion have acted in the way she did.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have become Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever situation occurred we faced it by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we might have prayed a great deal, when the problem presented itself we forgot our husband and acted as if we had none.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why do you not turn to your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why do you always meet the temptations alone?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as you confront situations by yourself you stay away from your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That was the basic cause of man's first fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a minister of the Word, I must learn the lesson of not speaking by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While I am speaking I must rely upon my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I must hide myself in Him and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I fail to do this, I will become another Eve and will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can see that we should not blame Satan too much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must blame ourselves because we have assumed the headship and have not respected our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We assumed the headship, forgetting that we are the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When mothers deal with their little children they may deal with them independently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may say, "I know how to take care of children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have been a mother for years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know what to do and I know how to do it."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you adopt this attitude, you immediately become Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although you may do a good job, in fact you are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must remember the principle of man's first fall: man renounced the wife's position and assumed the husband's position, making himself the head and the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether our efforts succeed or fail makes no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as we stay away from God and presume that we can act apart from Him, we have been defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may experience this even as we deal with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be defeated by our temper is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, if we try by ourselves to overcome our temper, we commit a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The attempt itself is a great sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Your trying to defeat your temper means that you are assuming the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must learn to say, "Lord, I do not care whether or not I can defeat my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Lord, I rely upon You for this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not my responsibility to deal with my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord, I am not the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You are my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I simply rely upon You.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I don't assume that I have the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Lord, You are my Head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Lord, You take care of my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we all learn this lesson and maintain this stand before the Lord, our temper will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Devil will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must learn this one, basic principle.</S>
