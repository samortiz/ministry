   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOW GOD ARRANGES EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does God arrange everything for our good?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone is different in nature, character, living, and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we all need a different kind of breaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The kinds of discipline that God arranges are as varied as the number of people there are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone is put into a different set of situations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A husband and a wife may be very close to each other, yet God will arrange a different environment for each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A father and a son, or a mother and a daughter, may likewise be very close to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet God arranges a different environment for each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In operating through our environment, God measures discipline to each one of us according to our individual needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every arrangement of God is with the view of training us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Greek all things means "everything."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All does not mean a hundred thousand things or even a million things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot tell how big the number is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything, all things, are arranged by God for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, nothing comes to us by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With us there is no coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All things are arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From our point of view, our experience may seem confusing and puzzling; we may not see the intrinsic meaning behind everything, and we may not understand what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God's Word says that all things work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not know what thing will bring us what kind of good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither do we know how many things are waiting for us and what good we will gain from them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But there is one thing we do know: Everything works together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing will happen to us that does not bring us good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must see clearly that God's arrangement is to produce holiness in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not work out this holiness in ourselves; God is the One who creates this holy character in us through our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One illustration will serve to explain how all things work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Hangchow there are many silk weavers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Weaving involves many threads and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If one looks at the fabric from the back, everything seems to be a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An outsider will be puzzled; he will not know what pattern is on the other side of the fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if he turns the fabric right side up, he will find beautiful figures, flowers, mountains, or rivers on it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing is clear while the fabric is being woven; one sees only red and green threads moving back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, our experience seemingly moves back and forth like a puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not know what design God has in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But every "thread" which God uses, every discipline from His hand, has its function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every color is there for a purpose, and the design is prearranged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God arranges our environment for the purpose of creating holiness in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every encounter is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not be clear today, but one day we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of the things may not look that nice at the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when we look back after some time, we will surely know why the Lord has done what He has done and what His purpose was for doing it.</S>
