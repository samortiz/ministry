   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SINGING HYMNS IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO ENLIVEN MAN S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we walk according to the Spirit, our spirit will be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what Ephesians 5:18-19 refers to: Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we are filled with God in spirit, we will spontaneously sing psalms, hymns, and songs with our heart, speaking to one another and praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How many songs did the Chinese scholars of Confucius write?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among all the scholars of Confucius whom you know of, how often do they sing, and how often do they sigh?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we sing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we do not sing that well, we Christians are those who have songs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We Christians are a singing people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 5:18 says, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be drunk with wine, but we should be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are to be filled in spirit, we must sing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are filled in spirit, what we have within will spontaneously be expressed without.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will begin to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I always sing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every day when I go for a walk, I sing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Singing is one outstanding trait of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am the worst in music, but I like to sing more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I always sing off-key.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sister Lee always tells me to stop singing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I criticize her also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She has been teaching school all her life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Her mind is very clear, but she would not sing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord that we have so many hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, this morning I was singing a hymn:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Give up the world, Christ to obtain,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is your heart s very need.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hymns, #1025</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I wrote this hymn in 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During that year I conducted a conference in Shanghai, and after that conference I spent a day resting in a scenic area.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As I was strolling there, I was humming some random melodies to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While I was thus musing, verse three of the hymn came to me:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Though very great is all the world,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And very small is your heart,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet the great world with all its wealth,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Never can fill your small heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now I would ask all the brothers and sisters over sixty years old to stand up and sing this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your singing is too proper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no need to be so proper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to sing like I do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I break all the rules of singing, yet I stir up others spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of you older sisters should go to sing in your home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to fire up everyone there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that only the young people can catch fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If all the older ones sit still in the meeting, how can we have a good home meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if the older ones would sing, their singing would surely cause the meeting to come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On this point I would ask you older ones to learn of me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not sing too properly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you break the rules, sometimes you sing even better.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today I may be the oldest one among all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not sing well, but I sing with life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please do not act like an old man or woman.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must be bold to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Previously, when I went to a home meeting and saw that six out of eight were older ones, I would ask myself, How are we going to meet?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But just now I saw some older ones singing with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of course, I do not mean that we should sing in a disorderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What I mean is that we should sing to enliven others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now our concept is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe if the older brothers and sisters would go to the home meeting and sing, the whole meeting will come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Besides these older saints, we still have a group of brothers and sisters between the ages of forty and sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of them must go and sing in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In addition, we have an army of young ones from twenty to thirty-nine years old.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All of them must not take a leave of absence from the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They must function properly in these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is a commando unit in the church, composed of those from age one to nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If these four groups of people would sing in the home meetings, the meetings will surely be enlivened.</S>
