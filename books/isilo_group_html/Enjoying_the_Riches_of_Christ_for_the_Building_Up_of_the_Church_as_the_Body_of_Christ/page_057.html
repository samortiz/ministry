The Brethren assemblies have been divided into many divisions. The Brethren started the church life in 1828, but after only ninety years, they were divided into one hundred fifty divisions. From that time until today there have been even more divisions. Today there may be a thousand divisions among the Brethren. One Brethren assembly was divided over the playing of the piano. Some insisted on using a piano, while others opposed the use of a piano. Eventually, that assembly was divided into two assemblies. When I spoke with those assemblies, I was very bold to tell them that they needed to drop all their teachings. I said, &#8220;The reason that you are so divided is that you take care only of teachings and opinions. You must drop all the doctrines and come back to Christ as life.&#8221; This offended them, so immediately after my message some of them rebuked me to my face. I do not want to be a troublemaker, but I have a real burden concerning the oneness.<p>If we all are for life, we are one, but if we are for doctrines, gifts, or anything other than life, we will be divided. We are here only for life. The Lord Jesus said that He came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. This is so that we can be one flock. We can be flocked together by Christ as our life, not by anything else. This is very clear.<p>Jesus is the door, not for us to go into heaven, but for us to come out of anything that holds us back from the church. Jesus is the door to release us, to set us free, from all kinds of folds. Then after we come out of the fold, He is not only our life but also our pasture and our Shepherd (vv. 9-11). He is the door, He is the pasture, He is the life, and He is the Shepherd. Today we are out of many folds to be in the flock, the church. We are the flock by the life of Jesus, and as the flock we are feeding on Jesus as the green pasture.<h2 class=head2>Oneness in the Divine Life and Nature with the Divine Position to Express the Father</h2><p>In John 17 the Lord prayed that we all would be one (vv. 11, 21-23). In what way can we all be one? Verse 22 says, &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&#8221; The glory that the Father gave to the Son is the divine life with the divine nature plus the divine position for the Son to express the Father. This glory has been given to us by the Son. Now we have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position. This is ours by our divine birth, by being born again. As children of God, we have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position to express the Father.<p>If we all would drop our concepts and simply be for the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position to express the Father, we all would be one. We can never be one by doctrines. We can never be one by opinions. Two brothers may have differing opinions about everything. One brother may think that the other brother&#8217;s hair is too long, while the other brother thinks that the first brother&#8217;s hair is too short. One brother thinks that the other should shave, but the other brother thinks that to shave too often is worldly. One brother feels that everyone should wear a tie to the meetings, while the other brother feels that this is too worldly because Jesus never wore a tie. We all have our opinions, so what shall we do? We must drop our opinions. The way to drop our opinions is by taking Christ as life. Without taking Christ as life, we may drop one opinion and pick up another opinion. We will have one opinion after another. We must drop the opinions and come back to the glory that the Lord Jesus has given us. This glory is the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position to express the Father. Hallelujah, we have God&#8217;s life, we have God&#8217;s nature, and we have the position as God&#8217;s children to express Him. This is our glory. If we care only for this glory, we all are one. Long hair or short hair, wide neckties or narrow neckties, shaving or not shaving-all these things make no difference.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
