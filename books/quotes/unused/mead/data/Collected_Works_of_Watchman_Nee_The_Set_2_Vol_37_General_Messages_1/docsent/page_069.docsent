   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In John 3, the Lord Jesus discussed the question of regeneration with Nicodemus, who said, "We know that You have come from God as a teacher."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord answered him, saying, "Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With a teacher, the main emphasis is teaching and learning; these are all outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With regeneration, it is a question of spirit and life; these are inward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many so-called Christians have tried to enter through the gate called "Teacher."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that as long as they understand the teachings of Christianity, as long as they are baptized and are familiar with the prophecies and types of the Bible, and as long as they have picked up outward Christian behavior such as prayer, attending services, and tithing, they can consider themselves good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These people are wrong about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible shows us that a Christian life begins from regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man is not regenerated and does not have the life of the Lord within Him, he is not yet a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let me repeat: Christianity is not an outward religion but an inward revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian is not one who is one outwardly but who is one inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 6, the Lord Jesus fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same group of people looked for Jesus the next day, and the Lord told them plainly: "You seek Me...because you ate of the bread and were filled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Again He said: "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" v. 35 . These men came to the Lord Jesus because they ate bread and were filled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not know what their real need was.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither did they know what the Lord was giving to men when He came to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They only saw the physical bread without but did not see the preciousness of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus was full of mercy; He did not hide Himself from these ignorant ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He opened Himself to them and told them that He is the bread of life and that He gives life to those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But these ones were still circling around the periphery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They asked, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?" v. 42 . They only knew the Lord Jesus from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord told them again, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world" v. 51 . The Jews contended with one another because of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their eyes only saw outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They wanted to know the Lord Jesus and understand His words in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But it was impossible for them to know and understand in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to pay attention to the words which followed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only were the Jews bewildered by the Lord's word, but many of His disciples did not understand it either.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They said, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" v. 60 . Many of the disciples went back to what they had left behind and no longer walked with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They stumbled and were no longer His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Five loaves and two fish on the outside attracted many to seek after the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when the inward bread of life was presented, many so-called disciples could not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How easy it is for men to pay attention to outward things and reject inward things!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, we ought to be warned here!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many who were called disciples dropped out halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who are Christians in an outward way will drop out halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do not touch life will drop out halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anyone who has not received the Lord's life within him cannot be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one needs to discourage such a one from becoming a Christian; he himself will find it impossible to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These so-called disciples did not withdraw because of tribulations or trials.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was only one reason for their withdrawal: "This word is hard; who can hear it?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They fell in the presence of the truth!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, nothing outward works.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An outward Christian will fall in the presence of the truth; there is no need for trials to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some people call themselves Christians, but they do not accept the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They do not understand the truth of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They doubt, misunderstand, and even mock and oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They only want the name of Christianity; they do not want the truth of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are Christians according to their own "theology," and not according to the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" v. 63 . When a man receives the Lord's word, he receives the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One characteristic of the outward Christian is that he cannot understand and will not believe, receive, or treasure the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of God's children have one fundamental feeling towards God's Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They believe, honor, and treasure God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This feeling towards the Bible is the basic and fundamental attitude which a Christian ought to have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a person calls himself a Christian, yet doubts, rather than believes the Bible, criticizes, rather than honors it, and tramples, rather than treasures it, he must not be a genuine Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the disciples who withdrew at the Lord's word were called disciples outwardly, in reality they were unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible says clearly, "For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and who was the one who would betray Him" v. 64 . This kind of outward Christian either withdraws halfway or mixes in with the disciples only to eventually betray the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the many so-called disciples were withdrawing, the Lord asked the twelve disciples: "Do you also want to go away?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Simon Peter answered and said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have words of eternal life, and we have believed..." vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>67-69 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter had received the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The heavenly Father had revealed to him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why he still followed the Lord when many withdrew.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord's word was like a yardstick which differentiated those who genuinely believed in Him from those who did not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It separated the outward ones from the inward ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christians who have revelation and who are Christians inwardly can withstand tests.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They treasure God's truth and are not afraid of any trial.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We see Paul suffering many persecutions and much tribulation for the sake of the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One day he was brought in chains to Caesarea to be judged by Festus.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even Festus himself admitted that Paul did not commit any crime and that the only questions against him were about a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive Acts 25:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, this is a sober question: Are you an outward Christian or an inward Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul had the experience; it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why he insisted that Jesus was living when others said that He had died.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even when others held him in chains, he said the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even when others charged him with many false accusations, he said the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the way to Damascus, he had indeed met the Jesus who was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, he could present his good testimony under any trial.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, no outward Christian can withstand the test of the truth or the test of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I wish everyone who called himself a Christian would settle this question once and for all: Is the Christianity you know outward, or is it inward?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Are you a Christian by tradition, by learning, or by revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Is your knowledge of the Lord Jesus in your head or in life and revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Is your Christianity something of man or something of God?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Finally, I will repeat again: "For he is not...who is one outwardly...But...who is one inwardly."</S>
