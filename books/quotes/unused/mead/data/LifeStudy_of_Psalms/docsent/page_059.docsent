   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Psalm 16:9-10 we see the revelation of the God-man, Christ, in His death Acts 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. His Heart Rejoicing and</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His Spirit with His Tongue Exulting</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 16:9a says that Christ's heart was rejoicing and His glory was exulting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means His heart was rejoicing in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Hebrew word for glory in verse 9 can be interpreted as spirit or tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Hebrew word means glory, but the Greek Septuagint translated the Hebrew word for glory into tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Peter quoted Psalm 16:9 from the Septuagint in Acts 2, he said, "My tongue exulted" v. 26 . Some other versions translate the Hebrew word for glory as mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, three things are referred to by the word glory: our spirit, our tongue, and our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Christ's death His heart was rejoicing, and His spirit with His tongue was exulting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our tongue in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the way to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many saints come to the meetings and sit quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are like the "marble Mary" outside some Catholic cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like to ask them, "Where is your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where is your mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where is your tongue?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the meetings their spirit is not exercised, their mouth is not exercised, and their tongue is not exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are in the meetings, we should exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our tongue to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will be glorious; we will be in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we do not exercise in such a way, we are in a low condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our tongue to speak Christ to one another in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we are glorious because we are exercising the three parts of our glory: the spirit, the mouth, and the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ's heart rejoicing and His glory, His spirit with His tongue, exulting indicate that Christ was obedient to God even unto death, and that the death of a cross Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was obedient unto death, not an ordinary death but a particular death, the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This also indicates that Christ was willing and happy to die for the accomplishment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He told us in John 10:17-18 that no one took His life away, but He laid it down.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also had the authority to take His life back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He died for the accomplishment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His Flesh His Physical Body Dwelling Securely</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His death, Christ's flesh His physical body dwelt securely Psa 16:9b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that Christ's body was buried in a secured tomb Matt 27:59-60 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This also indicates that Christ was resting physically in His burial waiting to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His Soul Having Gone to Sheol Hades</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>and Remaining There for Three Days</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His soul went to Sheol Hades and remained there for three days Psa 16:10a; Eph 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not to See Corruption Decay in His Physical Body</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He did not see corruption decay in His physical body Psa 16:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates His death and burial.</S>
