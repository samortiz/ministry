But we must see that unless we become the children of God, we cannot practice the Sermon on the Mount. The Sermon on the Mount is not for worldly people, the unbelievers, but for the children of the Father. This is indicated in Matthew 5:48, where the Lord said, "You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect." We are His children and He is our Father. We have His life. Therefore, we can be perfect as He is. For us to be perfect as the Father is perfect simply means that we have the Father's image, or in other words, that we express the Father.</P><P>However, there is still one crucial thing, and that is whether or not we are in the dominion of God. This is why the Lord Jesus told us to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. It is not righteousness first but the kingdom. First, we need to seek the kingdom, and then spontaneously we will have righteousness. As we have seen earlier, righteousness simply means to be right according to God, to be agreeable with God. This is to be perfect as God the Father is perfect.</P><P>I would like to stress again that what God wants is not moral people, religious people, or even so-called spiritual people. What God wants are people who remain under His dominion. As long as you are under God's dominion, God's authority, all things will be under your dominion, your authority. If you are going to represent God, you need to be in God's dominion.</P><P>In human society there are many deceiving things. The material things are deceptions. Thus, people are constantly anxious, saying, "What shall we eat? What shall we drink? With what shall we be clothed?" All these whats are deceptions. The Lord Jesus told us that these are things sought after by the Gentiles. We have to forget about these things and seek God's kingdom and God's righteousness.</P><P>But how about our living? In Matthew 6:32 the Lord Jesus told us that our "heavenly Father knows that you need all these things," and then in verse 33 He spoke a word as a promise: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." Do you really believe that the heavenly Father will take care of your living? I have been believing in the heavenly Father's care for many years. We have to believe in the Lord's word. If we seek the kingdom of God and the righteousness of God, He will give us His kingdom and His righteousness. In addition, He will give us all the things that we need.</P><P>I realize that it is not so easy for the young people to believe that the Father will take care of all their needs. Many of you are worried about your future. I am afraid that many of you are also anxious about your marriage. A sister may wonder, "What kind of husband should I have?" A brother may consider, "What kind of wife is good for me?" Let me tell you honestly that without God, you can never have a good husband or a good wife. This is why today there are so many divorces. Learn to leave everything to God.</P><P>When I was young in the Lord's ministry, the young people considered me as a teacher of the Word of God and also as one who was experienced in the matter of marriage, since I was already married. Therefore, they used to come to me for advice concerning their marriage. I gave them the best instructions that I had collected, and they tried to apply them. But eventually, I found out that these good instructions did not work.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Life for the Preaching of the High Gospel &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
