   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE THIRTEEN A WORD CONCERNING DIVISION AND APOSTASY Scripture Reading: Deut 12:1 13:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In previous messages we have covered the general advices and warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we turn in the next message to the section of Deuteronomy dealing with the rehearsing of the general statutes and judgments 14:1 26:19 , I would like to give a further word concerning division and apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The general advices and warnings in Deuteronomy 5:32 11:32 are rather general, but in chapters twelve and thirteen they are very specific and definite.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Moses' word in Deuteronomy 12 and 13, we must avoid division and reject apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter twelve he charges us to keep the ground of oneness among God's people, and in chapter thirteen he is very definite in the condemnation of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The children of Israel were not allowed to tolerate apostasy even in someone as close as a brother, son, daughter, or wife 13:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of loving the apostates, they were to deal with them severely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not tolerate apostasy, and they likewise were not to tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God hates apostasy and He condemns division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HERESY DAMAGING THE PERSON OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regarding apostasy and division, the Old Testament and the New Testament are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament term for apostasy is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Apostasy and heresy are an insult to the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Old Testament the apostates turned away from God and followed idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was an insult to God, and He could not tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the heretics denied that Jesus Christ is God incarnated to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a denial is heresy, New Testament apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This heresy damages the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, God does not tolerate apostasy or heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DIVISION DAMAGING THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord also will not tolerate division.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord hates division because it destroys His people as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament the children of Israel were God's people for His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament the corporate expression of the Lord is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whereas heresy insults and damages the person of Christ, division damages the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Division kills the Body of Christ and cuts it into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because heresy damages the Head and because division kills the Body, the Lord, in both the New Testament and the Old Testament, will never tolerate heresy and division.</S>
