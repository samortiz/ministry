   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to consider some common problems we encounter in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose our work appears to encounter financial difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should we do when God puts us through a trial of material shortage?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the shortage in provision halts our work, the Lord surely would put a question mark on what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He would probably ask, "What are you serving Me for?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers and sisters, whether or not we will perform well in our work depends a great deal on whether we have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot quit just because a little trouble comes our way or a little trial bothers us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No servant of Christ can stipulate that he will go to work in fair weather but stay at home if it rains.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have a mind to suffer, we will defy difficulties; we will defy hardship; we will defy physical infirmity; and we will even defy death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A mind to suffer stands up to the devil and declares, "I will go on no matter what may happen to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are inwardly afraid of anything, Satan will threaten us with that very same thing, and we will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we say, "I am not afraid of hunger!", Satan will not be able to do anything to us when he sends us hunger; he will have to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we say, "I am not afraid of the cold!", Satan will not be able to do anything to us when he sends us cold weather; he will have to flee once again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we say, "I am afraid of sickness," Satan will surely send us sickness, because he knows that sickness will bring us down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we say, "I am not afraid of sickness!", Satan will not be able to do anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have a mind to suffer, Satan will use whatever we are afraid of to attack us, and we will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every servant of God must be well prepared and not afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must persist when this and that happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must persist when trials come to our family or sickness comes to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must persist even when hunger or cold comes our way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have this attitude within us, Satan will not be able to do anything to us because we will have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without such a mind to suffer, we will fall as soon as Satan confronts us with the very thing we fear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will shrink back from God's work and become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, we should declare to the Lord, "Because of Your love and the power of Your grace, I am committed to do what I am doing whatever the consequences may be, whether it be heaven or hell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will be my stand, whether or not I think I am up to it!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have such a mind, Satan will seize our weakness, and we will be finished and proven unprofitable for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to pray for mercy to know what a mind to suffer is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A mind to suffer is a settled decision within oneself to be on the Lord's side, no matter what the future may hold and no matter what circumstances one may encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A mind to suffer does not necessarily lead to suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is possible that one will not suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But an inward conviction is always present.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without such a conviction and determination, a little difficulty will knock a person off his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if this inward conviction is present, whether or not there is outward trouble will mean little.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you see what I am saying?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way of service for a Christian is not the way of suffering but the way of having a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can thank the Lord if He provides you with food and clothing, and you also can thank Him if He does not provide you with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These things do not mean much to you they can be in abundance or scarcity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please remember that a Christian does not need to go out of his way to look for suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, he should have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Christian is one who is prepared to accomplish his task whether or not difficulty lies along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does not draw back at the face of difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the matter of his mind-set is not settled, all other issues will not be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider the example of traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are physically weak, you naturally need a more comfortable bed than a stronger person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if you say, "I must have a comfortable bed because I am not very strong," you will be vulnerable to the enemy in that point; he will give you an uncomfortable bed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A mind to suffer ignores the issue of a bed and continues with one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you have been provided with a comfortable bed, however, there is no virtue in going out of your way to sleep on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Lord gives you a good bed, take it, and if He gives you a bad bed, take it also.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to continue with your work no matter how bad your bed is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must never shrink back for the sake of a bed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This mind-set is what the Bible calls a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some brothers have less than favorable material provisions in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet this does not necessarily mean that they have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not imagine that Christians who live in unfavorable circumstances will have, as a matter of course, more of a mind to suffer than those who live in more favorable circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only those who have consecrated themselves to the Lord will have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A mind to suffer is not limited by anything; it does not have a bottom line.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may be provided with a hard floor for your bed if you go to one place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may not even have a hard floor in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Your bed may just be straw strewn on muddy ground.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some force themselves to accept such beds.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are indeed suffering, but there is a limit to their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They can tolerate a hard floor but nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They seemingly tell others that they have stooped low enough and that they can stoop no lower.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is having the experience of suffering without the mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some brothers may go through their life with relative ease and enjoyment, yet they can always adjust themselves happily to lower standards of living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They can sleep on a hard floor as well as on straw.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have no complaints, and they are happy to take whatever comes along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is having a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God is calling for men to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must remember that it is not a matter of suffering but a matter of a mind for suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In order to serve the Lord, we must have a mind to suffer; otherwise, God cannot use us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those who do not have a mind to suffer will collapse at the mildest trial.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They will quit their work as soon as Satan puts something in their path.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A mind to suffer is an ability to lower one's standard of living unconditionally.</S>
