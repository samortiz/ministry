   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX CHRIST HIS PERSON 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider Christ s person in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>D. IN INCARNATION 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God Manifested in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the incarnation Christ is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Word, who is the very God, Christ became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, He is God the Triune God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is important for us to realize that it was the entire God and not only the Son of God who was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This God, who the Word is, is not a partial God; rather, He is the entire God God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament does not say that the Word, who became flesh, was God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, the New Testament indicates that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word is the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of the influence of traditional teaching, we may think that only the Son of God, not the entire God, was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it says that God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the entire God became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through incarnation and human living God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the flesh means in the likeness, in the fashion, of man Rom 8:3; Phil 2:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the form of man Christ appeared to people 2 Cor 5:16 , yet He was God manifested in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The God-Man a. Conceived of the Holy Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having the Essence of God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the God-man, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Gospel of Luke is unique in telling us how the God-man was conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was conceived not of a man but of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit is God Himself reaching man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the conceiving of the God-man, the Holy Spirit came into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He has the divine essence, the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we use the word essence in a strong sense to denote something even more intrinsic than nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The essence is the intrinsic constituent of a certain substance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit not only with the divine nature but with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning the conceiving of the God-man, Luke 1:35 says, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; wherefore also the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the cloud overshadowed the Mount of Transfiguration Matt 17:5 and the tabernacle Exo 40:34, 38 , the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems that, according to this verse, the Holy Spirit only came upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us that Mary was found having in womb out of the Holy Spirit lit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>, and the thing begotten generated in her is out of the Holy Spirit lit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>. This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been generated in Mary s womb before she delivered the Lord Jesus.</S>
