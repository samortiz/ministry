   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAMB LAMP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the church age, the lamps are the seven Spirits, but when we arrive in the New Jerusalem, the lamp will be the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof Rev 21:23, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. God is the light, and the Lamb is the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that God is in Christ, shining out over the city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, God Himself through the Spirit is shining on the stands with all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In eternity, the entire New Jerusalem will be a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read Revelation 21 and 22 properly, we see that the New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold, just like a golden stand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The throne of God and the Lamb is on the top.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is God in Christ shining out as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the lamp, and within this lamp is God as the light Therefore, Christ shines out God, and the city shines out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the whole earth will walk in the light of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is the Holy City so bright and full of light?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is because this city is saturated with the water of life and nourished with the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life Rev 22:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, life will fill, saturate, and permeate this city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The city will be full of life, so that life will be the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our God is the light, His Christ is the lamp, and we are the golden lampstands holding the lamp shining out the light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a corporate entity composed of the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Body-Christ, full of life; and this life is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SHINING WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we must come to Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The woman in this chapter describes the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars Rev 12:1, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>. To understand this woman, I would suggest that you read The Glorious Church by Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this book, Brother Nee tells about four women.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first is Eve in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second is the church as the counterpart of Christ in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third is the wonderful, universal woman in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then, eventually, the fourth woman is the Bride, the New Jerusalem, in the last two chapters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee points out that the woman in Revelation 12 denotes all God s chosen people, from the patriarchs, through Israel, to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This woman is clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that her main part is covered with the sun, which signifies the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under her feet is the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The moon signifies the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And upon her head are twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The stars signify the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the patriarchs and the law are in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Jesus came, it was night.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The patriarchs were the stars, and the people of Israel were the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, when Christ came, it was the dawning of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the church age is clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All God s selected people as a whole are this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the whole universe, there are only three kinds of light bearers: the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these are on or around the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are full of light, like the sun, moon, and stars.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not only God s people; we are the greater part of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not the stars or the moon; we are the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BEARING THE GLORY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The New Jerusalem shines the brightest of all, because she bears the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And he carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal Rev 21:10-11, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>. The sun will still shine during the time of the New Jerusalem, but there will be no need of the sun, because of the brightness of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light Rev 22:5, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>. Suppose the electric light is burning in our room in the morning, and then the sun begins to shine in the window.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At such a time the light becomes useless because of the brighter shining of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These verses do not mean that there will be no sun in the New Jerusalem, but that God will be the light, and His light will swallow up the sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His light will become the light of the city, so that in the city there is no night.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God will shine there day and night as the greatest light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>With the shining of the divine sun, there will be no moon, and there will be no night.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, outside the city, there will still be day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>THE LIGHT IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The New Jerusalem is a picture, showing us how the Body-Christ, the church life, should be full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should be filled and saturated with light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many of us have been in various denominations and free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we were there, we all sensed that there was no light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We could participate in all kinds of sports and worldly entertainments, and never experience any shining.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet on Sunday, we could dress properly and go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There was absolutely no light there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But one day we came to the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From the very first meeting, there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we opened to the Lord and called on His name, the more the light shined.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Day by day in the church life we are under the shining of the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The church is the lampstand holding the lamp, and the lamp has seven eyes as a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the churches Christ is walking and observing with his seven flaming eyes; so the churches are full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everyone is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some would try to hide, but there is no place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the church there is a heavenly flashlight, shining all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>None can escape.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The more we try to hide, the more we are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The wisest way is to come to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The heavenly flashlight is not to hurt us, but to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need the shining of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whether we are the church or not does not depend upon what we say or what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It depends altogether upon the light.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The light is the very presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When He is here, who can deny the light, and who can escape the light?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the church there is no night, for Christ as the day is here!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is no need for anyone to manage or control.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He is here!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Where there is light, there is order.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Where there is darkness, there is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the church life we are all under the control of the light, for here there is the shining of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We are all under His sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon thee Eph 5:14, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>. Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the lampstand with the proper shining of the lamp.</S>
