<h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES<br />
FOR THEIR ORGANIC RELATIONSHIP</h2>
<p>In the last three chapters, we have seen three intrinsic matters related to the church: the church&rsquo;s intrinsic essence, intrinsic growth, and intrinsic building up. The fourth intrinsic matter is the intrinsic fellowship of the churches for their organic relationship. The Greek word for fellowship is <em>koinonia,</em> meaning joint participation, common participation. This is a very sweet term, but it is difficult to get the proper, accurate, adequate, and equivalent term in the English language. The problem is that the proper meaning of the term <em>fellowship,</em> along with many other crucial terms in the Bible, has been spoiled by the traditional or religious interpretation in Christianity. To some, fellowship is &ldquo;socializing.&rdquo; Many people go to the denominational services for this reason. They have some form of worship, but their main interest is in socializing with one another. We must drop such a degraded concept. Our understanding of &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; should be according to the pure Word of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
