   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DYING TO LIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that we have the principle that the process of the Man-Savior s resurrection began while He was dying, we need to ask when the Lord Jesus died.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Did He die only on the day of the Passover?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament indicates that He began to die immediately after He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Throughout His years on earth, He was dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every moment of every day, He was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that while He was living in the home of a poor carpenter, He was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The process of His resurrection began as He was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is significant that the Lord Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord did not say that He is the life and the resurrection; He said first that He is the resurrection and then that He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why does resurrection come first in John 11:25?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection is mentioned first in this verse because throughout His life the Lord Jesus was dying and resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus told Martha that her brother would rise again, she replied, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day John 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here Martha prolonged the resurrection to the distant future, to a time just before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord was indicating that He is the resurrection now, the resurrection in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not say, I shall be the resurrection; He said, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord could say this because while He was living in the human life, He was resurrecting by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When did the Lord s death begin?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His death began immediately after He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When did His resurrection begin?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His resurrection began with His dying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Man-Savior was dying to live; He lived by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s life on earth for thirty-three and a half years was a life of dying to live, a life of living by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, His death was completed on the cross, and His resurrection was completed on the third day after His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was a beginning of His death and also a completion of it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, there was a beginning of His resurrection and a completion of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I encourage you to bring this matter to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that He was the dying-to-live Man-Savior and also the living-by-dying Man-Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While He was living, He was dying, and while He was dying, He was living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may even say that while He was dying, He was resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His thirty-three and a half years on earth were a long process of death and also of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With Him resurrection and death went together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to our opinion, we may think that the Lord Jesus should have said to Martha, Do you not know that I am the life?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day I will die, and then I shall be the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the Lord said that He was the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that He was resurrection proves that He was also life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He had not been resurrecting, He would not have been able to live.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a person is born, does he begin to live, or does he begin to die?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, as soon as a human being is born, he begins to die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Death, therefore, does not come as an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, death comes as a process.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For some, this process is short; for others, it is very long.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But whatever the case may be, all unbelievers are in the process of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is our situation as believers?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are we dying or living?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today we believers are dying to live, and we are living by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The unbelievers only have the process of dying, but we have both dying and living, both death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, the more we die, the more we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>RESURRECTION AS A PROCESS OF TRANSFIGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the previous message we pointed out that through the incarnation humanity was added to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In other words, through the process of incarnation God put humanity upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In a similar way, in the process of resurrection certain elements were put into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In particular, these elements include the Lord s human living and His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, resurrection was a process of transfiguration in which these elements were put into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the Spirit who has entered into the believers.</S>
