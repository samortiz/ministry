<h1 class="title">KNOWING THE NATURAL MAN<br />
AND THE SELF</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:2-3; 4:6-7; Matt. 16:21-24</h1>
<p>In order to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and to function in the church, we need to see not only the things of God but also the things of man. In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the natural man and the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORK DEPENDING ON THE PERSON,<br />
NOT ON METHODS</h2>
<p>God never depends on methods to carry out His work; He depends on the person He uses. He does not need a good and effective method. Rather, His work can be accomplished effectively only when the person in His hand is right.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God does not often tell His servants how to work; He seldom tells them what should be done first, second, and so forth. Rather, in relation to His servants, God focuses on the kind of person they are. He does not deal with the method used in the work but with the person who does the work. This is because in His eyes the method is a trivial matter, but the person who does the work is a crucial matter. God always deals with the person involved in the work. He deals with those who serve Him.</p>
<p>The method by which God works is the person in His hand. This is an important principle revealed in the Bible. The best methods are of no value to God. He wants to deal with the person of His servants. Neither in the Old Testament nor in the New Testament can we find a case where God called someone and gave instructions concerning how to serve Him. God never gave anyone a list of methods. On the contrary, God always spent time to work on the person whom He called. Some examples of those who were called and sent by God according to this principle include Moses and Isaiah in the Old Testament and Peter, James, John, Paul, and Timothy in the New Testament.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word reveals that a person who has been dealt with by God and who has become useful to Him is God&rsquo;s method and His way. God can accomplish what He wants with such a person.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for saying this, but the more I observe the serving ones, the heavier my heart becomes. I think that this feeling is from God. You have given your time to serve, but your concept is that you are here to learn methods. If our person is not right, messages and methods cannot help us. A message that would have been useful to Moses will not be useful to us, and a method that would have been effective with Paul will not be effective with us, because our person is not the same as Moses&rsquo; or Paul&rsquo;s person. Our person is what matters. We cannot do a successful work merely by understanding and remembering every point in a message. A successful work does not depend on our ability to understand messages or to learn methods. Rather, it depends on our person being useful in God&rsquo;s hand, not on the messages we give or the methods we use. The kind of person we are determines the kind of work we can do. Even if we could give the messages that Paul gave and apply the methods that he used, our work would not compare with his work. Our person is God&rsquo;s method; God focuses on our person. Our work is measured not by our messages or by our methods but by our person.</p>
<p>The kind of person that we are determines the condition of our work. Our ability to give a certain message or to use a certain method does not determine the condition of our work. Rather, the kind of work we can do is determined by the kind of person we are. Our person is what matters.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on our person. This is not as high or profound as the matters covered in the previous chapters, because it will direct our attention toward ourselves. Although this matter is neither high nor profound, it is personal and practical. Please allow me to speak freely before the Lord concerning our condition as serving ones, and please receive these words. Our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand will depend on how we respond to this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THAT THE NATURAL MAN IS A THORNBUSH</h2>
<p>A person who is useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, or one who desires to be used by God, must know his natural man, his self. God always shows those whom He intends to use a vision of their natural man. Moses was such a servant of God. Because God selected Moses and determined to use him before he was even born, God arranged Moses&rsquo; family environment, giving him pious parents to infuse godly thoughts into him. God also arranged for him to live in an Egyptian palace and to learn the top culture of the time (Exo. 2:1-10; Acts 7:22). These environments were arranged by God.</p>
<p>God also worked on Moses&rsquo; heart, giving him a desire to serve God and a longing to be used by God. When Moses was nearly forty years old, he had the heart to rescue his brothers out of the oppression of the Egyptians (Exo. 2:23-25; Heb. 11:24-25). But because Moses had not seen his natural man at that time, he tried to save the Israelites by his natural man and according to his self. For this reason, God caused him to meet rejection, and Moses fled to the land of Midian, where he shepherded a flock for forty years, until he was eighty years old (Exo. 2:14-15; 3:1; Acts 7:29-30). In Psalm 90:10 Moses said, &ldquo;The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years.&rdquo; In his eyes, eighty years old was the age at which he should have died. To him, at eighty years of age everything was over, finished.</p>
<p>However, that was when God formally called Moses and began to use him. When Moses was called, He showed him a vision of his natural man. Moses was shepherding a flock in the wilderness of Mount Horeb when he saw a thornbush burning with fire but not being consumed (Exo. 3:2). This was an extraordinary scene. When fire burns on a pile of stones and the stones remain intact, it is nothing special. But for fire to burn within a thornbush without consuming the thornbush is something extraordinary. Moses was amazed at this sight and went to look more closely at the thornbush, and it was then that God called to him out of the midst of the thornbush (vv. 3-4).</p>
<p>There are three points that require our attention. First, fire was burning within the thornbush; second, the thornbush was burning but was not consumed; and third, a voice came out of the flame of fire in the midst of the thornbush. God used this special scene to reveal something to Moses. The thornbush represents Moses. Thorns are a symbol of the fallen natural man because thorns are a part of the curse brought in by the fall. According to Genesis 3:17 and 18, the ground was cursed to bring forth thorns after man&rsquo;s fall. Hence, thorns refer to fallen man. A person who is called to be used by God is not cedar, which is good material, but a thornbush. This means that those who are called by God are descendants of Adam.</p>
<p>We should never think that we are proper persons with an honorable character or that we are of noble descent. These are not the thoughts of a person who is being called. The first vision God wants us to see is that we are but a thornbush. Moses was of nobler descent than we are. He was a bona fide Israelite, his parents feared God, and he received the highest education in Egypt. According to historical records, he was capable and commanded the army in Egypt. From man&rsquo;s point of view, Moses was excellent material. However, when he was called, God showed him that he was nothing but a thornbush.</p>
<p>Every descendant of Adam is a thornbush. We must submit to God and say, &ldquo;I am but a thornbush. If You remove the holy fire from me, there will be nothing left.&rdquo; The fire of glory was burning in an unseemly thornbush. This glorious situation did not depend on the thornbush but on the fire. The thornbush was not valuable, but the flame of fire burning in the thornbush was valuable. Furthermore, a voice came out of the fire burning in the thornbush. This means that God came in the fire to the thornbush. If the fire were removed from the thornbush, nothing but the thornbush would be left. If the fire of the divine life were to be removed from us, we would be nothing but a thornbush. Hence, none of the serving ones can boast, because we are nothing but a thornbush.</p>
<p>The thornbush has a special meaning in the Bible. When the Sadducees were debating with the Lord concerning resurrection, the Lord said, &ldquo;Concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the section concerning the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob&rsquo;? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (Mark 12:26-27). The Lord Jesus referred to the thornbush in Exodus 3 when speaking concerning resurrection. As those who have been gained and are being used by God, we are a thornbush according to our old, natural man. However, there is a fire in us; God has come to us in the fire. The God of resurrection, the life of resurrection, and the glory of resurrection have come to the natural man.</p>
<p>In ourselves we are a thornbush; we have nothing to boast of. In terms of character, status, family descent, background, and environment, we cannot be compared to Moses. Hence, if Moses was a thornbush, we also are a thornbush. When we see this vision, we can be used by God. Every person who is called to be used by God must see that he is but a thornbush, having nothing to boast of and nothing to depend on. A thornbush does not have any value. It is a sign of the curse, and it does not have any use. According to our natural man, as descendants of Adam, we are good for nothing other than God&rsquo;s curse.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not bring anything of our self&mdash;whether it be status, family descent, background, or character&mdash;into our service. If we want to be used by God, the first vision we must see is that we are a thornbush. The elders and deacons have answered God&rsquo;s call to do His work; hence, they must also see that they are a thornbush. If we do not see this, our service will have no future. People in the world desire status, qualifications, and experience, but God does not want our qualifications or experience in the service. He wants us only as we are. We are a thornbush that deserves to be cursed. Every servant of God will eventually realize that in God&rsquo;s view, he is a thornbush.</p>
