   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The earlier overcomers will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord will reward the overcomers in this age with what they are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They will enjoy their victory, but the defeated ones who were not ready will have nothing to enjoy as their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, the Lord will deal with them so that they can become matured and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, the majority of the believers will enjoy what they are in Christ for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can prove this according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are victorious in the Lord, we enjoy our victory every day, but when we are defeated, the enjoyment of the Lord is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are victorious, the Lord is our enjoyment in what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we would, could, and should enjoy in the Lord will be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When people graduate from college, their graduation time is an enjoyment of what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They enjoy the fruit of their labor during their college years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who failed to make passing grades still have to come back to school so that they can graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the educational system's way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This educational system is a wise way, but our God is wiser.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has a big operation in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He selected millions of people, who were saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grace is based upon mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our salvation has nothing to do with what we are or with what we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God saved us and gave us so much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He gave us Himself, the divine life, the Holy Spirit, and Christ as His embodiment, the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because He gave us so much, we should be those who overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But regretfully many believers would not care for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They would care only for their eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They would say, "As long as I am eternally saved and can go to heaven, I will be satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may be satisfied, but the Lord is not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, whoever does not overcome in this age will not be satisfied in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They will have nothing with which to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we are Christians, we have to respond to the Lord's call to be overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have pointed out that Revelation, the last book of the Bible, is a book concerning the overcomers see The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>63-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The last book of the Bible is nearly a closed book to many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that nobody understands what it is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation refers to the seven golden lampstands, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, this book concludes with a mysterious city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Revelation 21:16, the city will be a square of twelve thousand stadia a stadion equals about six hundred feet .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The city is of pure gold and precious stones with gates of pearl vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many readers and teachers of the Bible do not see the significance of this mysterious city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because many Bible teachers do not understand the book of Revelation, they basically avoid it in their teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the Lord's mercy, He has shown us that Revelation is a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was not written by a great scholar but by the apostle John, who was a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This fisherman surely did not have a theological mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His writings are basically simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In his Gospel, John opens in a simple way by saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His final book, the book of Revelation, was also written in a very simple way, but from my youth I found it very difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By reading it I realized that there must be something in it which is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that gradually by His mercy, Revelation has become an open book to me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we see what is revealed in this book, we will see that it is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The main subject of the first twenty chapters of the book of Revelation is the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation 20 shows us that the overcoming martyrs will be resurrected to be the co-kings with Christ, the King, to enter into a city in which they will enjoy what they are in Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An overcomer is someone who overcomes in every area of his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus is moving within us to live through us even in the way that we comb and cut our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not follow Him in this matter, we will be defeated in having a worldly hair style.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Lord says, "Don't comb your hair that way," we should respond, "Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whatever You want, Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what it means to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that we love Him more than our self, more than our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>An overcomer knows and loves only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In a sense, the revelation concerning the overcomers is simple, but we may wonder why such a seemingly simple subject occupies the first twenty chapters of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is because there are different categories of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One category of overcomers is the martyrs of the Old Testament and the New Testament up to the time before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation 6 unveils that these martyred saints are underneath the altar crying out, "How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" v. 10 . The second category of overcomers is the man-child caught up to God and to His throne in Revelation 12:5.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The third category of overcomers is the hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers, the firstfruits, in Revelation 14:1-5.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will be raptured to the heavenly Mount Zion before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who are standing on the glassy sea in Revelation 15:2-4 are the fourth category of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These four categories of overcomers constitute the fifth category, which is the prepared bride in Revelation 19:7-9.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thank the Lord that He is able to make so many of His believers overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need twenty chapters of the book of Revelation to show us how the believers are made overcomers by the Lord's abounding and sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The last two chapters of Revelation unveil the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That will be the totality of all the believers throughout all the generations of the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By then all of God's chosen and redeemed people will have been made overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This gives us an overview of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible as a whole is the history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people have had histories, or biographies, written about them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When I finished writing the biography of Brother Watchman Nee entitled Watchman Nee: A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age , I considered that God also has a biography, a history.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible is the best history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Old Testament is the history of God with man, and the New Testament is the history of God in continuation within man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the Old Testament, God was only with man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He did not get into man until He became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Incarnation was God entering into man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The first chapter of the New Testament in the Gospel of Matthew gives us a record of how God entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From that day the God with man became the very God within man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thank God that we are saved, regenerated, blood-washed, and Spirit-filled Christians with God in us!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If someone asks us who we are, we might say, "I am a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A Christian is a believer in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But who are you as a believer in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The top answer is "I am God within me."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We believers are "God in us."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The church is God in a group of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This does not mean that we are God in His Godhead but that we have God within us as our life, nature, element, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To say that we are "God in us" means that we are a part of God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Bible is the history of God with man in the Old Testament and then of God within man in the New Testament.</S>
