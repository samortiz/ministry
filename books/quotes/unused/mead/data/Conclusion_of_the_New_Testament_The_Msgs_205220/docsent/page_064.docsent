   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Seven Eyes of Christ the Stone-Savior for God's Building</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seven eyes, the seven Spirits, of Jehovah are the seven eyes of Christ, who is the Stone-Savior for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zechariah 3:9 says, "For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reference to engraving the stone indicates that this stone is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In one day, by that engraving on the cross, the Lord Jesus took away all the sins of God's people John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the stone with the seven eyes is Christ, the Stone-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that Christ is the Stone-Savior by the fact that the seven eyes of the stone in Zechariah 3:9 become the seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lamb here has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in 5:6 the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we have a further development over Zechariah, for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a reference to Zechariah 4:10, where we are told that the seven eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Zechariah 3 and 4 we have the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of Jehovah, all of which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both in Exodus and Zechariah the lampstand is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in Revelation, the book of consummation, there are seven lampstands signifying seven local churches Rev 1:11-12, 20b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that Christ as signified by the lampstand in Exodus and the Spirit of God as signified by the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah are for the reproduction of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One lampstand is reproduced in the seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, there were more than seven local churches on earth at the time of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the number seven in Revelation 1 is a representative number.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the local churches as the many lampstands are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit as the one lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This reproduction is actually a multiplication of the wonderful expression of Christ as the life-giving Spirit in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus 25 the emphasis is on the stand on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Zechariah the emphasis is on the lamps on the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 1:13 says, "In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ today is in the midst of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Son of Man, He is moving in the churches to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He cares for the churches in His humanity.</S>
