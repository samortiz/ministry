   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Putting Man before the Tree of Life Indicating that God Desires</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>that Man Would Take Him,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Signified by the Tree of Life, as Man's Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The tree of life Gen 2:8-9 is a symbol of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is Spirit John 4:24 ; as such, He is abstract, difficult for people to grasp, understand, or touch.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His wisdom God used the tree of life as a symbol of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tree of life is a particular tree.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the other different kinds of trees, such as the apple tree, the peach tree, and the banana tree, are easily understood by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But not many people understand what the tree of life is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Life is mysterious and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tree of life symbolizes God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when we take the tree of life, we take God into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although this seems very simple, the tree of life is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On a radio program some years ago in Los Angeles, a famous preacher and Bible teacher was asked what the tree of life is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He replied that, since the tree of life no longer existed, there was no further need for us to know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His answer indicated that he was short of the proper biblical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tree of life is mentioned not only in Genesis 2 but also in Revelation 2 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 2:7 says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could the Lord give us to eat of something that no longer exists?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Revelation 22:2 the Bible concludes emphatically with the matter of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tree of life continues to exist, but few understand the meaning of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life is inexplicable, and God also is inexplicable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The tree of life in Genesis 2:9 symbolizes God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the tree of life can also be called "the tree of God."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the description in Revelation 22:2, the tree of life apparently is a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse says that the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, it grows along the river on both of its banks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A pine tree, which grows upward, can never occupy two banks of a river; but a vine can.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 15 the Lord Jesus said that He was the true vine v. 1 . The other vines are symbols, but the Lord Jesus is the real vine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we put Genesis 2, John 15, and Revelation 22 together, we can see that God is the tree of life and that the tree of life is a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a vine God can reach people wherever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's Prohibiting the Fallen Man,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>by the Cherubim and the Flaming Sword,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>from Taking the Tree of Life Indicating that</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's Glory, Holiness, and Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do Not Allow the Sinful Man</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>to Abuse the Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan's tempting of man to take the tree of knowledge indicates that Satan wants to keep man from taking God as his life Gen 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After man took of the tree of knowledge, God placed cherubim and a flaming sword Gen 3:24 before the tree of life in order to prevent man from taking of the tree of life also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's prohibiting of fallen man by the cherubim and the flaming sword from taking the tree of life indicates that God's glory signified by the cherubim , holiness signified by the flame , and righteousness signified by the sword do not allow the sinful man to abuse the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sword signifies God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Revelation 19 the Lord is the One who judges in righteousness v. 11 with the sharp sword that proceeds out of His mouth v. 15 . The Lord judges by the sword, and the sword is related to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's glory, holiness, and righteousness keep man away from taking God as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fallen man has lost his position to enter into God to take God as his life.</S>
