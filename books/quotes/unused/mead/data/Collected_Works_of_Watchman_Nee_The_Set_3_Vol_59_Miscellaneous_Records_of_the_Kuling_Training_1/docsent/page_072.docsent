   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DEPUTY AUTHORITY MUST NOT TRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO UPHOLD HIS OWN AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A deputy authority must not try to uphold his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you think that you can demand obedience, that your position, gift, or power justifies such a demand, you are not qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If your disposition is such that you want others to obey you, you are not qualified to be an authority; you are not the type of person who can receive submission from others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The result of rebellion, no matter where it occurs and no matter whom it is directed against, is the overturning of God's authority, not a challenge to man's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are challenged as a deputy authority, you have to realize that others are not offending you; there is no need for you to jump up in defense of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are offending the authority whom you represent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In reality they are rebelling against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever rebellion occurs, you should uphold God's authority and grieve for its neglect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As for you, there should be no feeling of personal offense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether an offense is directed against you or not, the ultimate challenge is against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As for you, you must be willing to be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the apostles played a leading role in God's work, they were not afraid of being offended in the matter of authority; their prime concern was upholding God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You should never be concerned with rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should have no personal expectation of your own; you are here to uphold God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If anyone has offended you, you should say to yourself, "I am merely a deputy authority; I am also ignorant in many areas."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If anyone offends God's authority, this offense has nothing to do with me personally; I merely acknowledge the anointing's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Except for the fact that God has placed His authority upon me, I have no desire to assume any authority of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others do not have to submit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even when others submit to me, I know that it is because God's authority is upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, when I find God's anointing resting upon a person, I will submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two hundred and fifty leaders among the Israelites offered incense to God; they sinned and were judged and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But what happened to the censers?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were not destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God ordered that they be hammered into plates and used as a covering for the altar, because the censers were sanctified already Num 16:36-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that the brass of those censers was different from the brass of any other kind of censers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is any difference at all, the difference lies in the fact that it was touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is there anything we have which has not been received from God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is any difference between us and others, it is because God's authority is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other than this authority, we are no different than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philemon was the same as Onesimus, and Aquila and Priscilla were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Can we say that all masters are better than their servants?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Can we say that all fathers are better than their sons?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can we say that all husbands are better than their wives?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why then does God want servants to obey masters, wives to obey husbands, and children to obey parents?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants this because this is the order of authority He has arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is unrelated to whether or not a person is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is God who has ordained everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No deputy authority is self-appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not choose to be an authority myself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every one of us has to know that authority is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no authority that is not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone obeys us, we have to know that this happens because God has ordained it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The same principle applies to our submission to authority and our acting as the authority to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All authority is appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a gross mistake for us to think that we are an authority by ourselves or to try to establish ourselves as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is wrong for any brother to recommend himself as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not uphold ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not have any intrinsic authority within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of man's authority comes from outside of him; God is the One who has appointed him to be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there is any authority in us, this authority should merely lead others to obey God's authority in us; it should not demand that others obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE BASIS OF DEPUTY AUTHORITY OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything about a deputy authority hinges on the kind of obedience he renders to other authorities above him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not have any craving to be a deputy authority or any expectation of others obeying us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should only expect to obey others; obedience should be our very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are not obedient, we will not feel peaceful or comfortable within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The obedience I am speaking of here is different from the obedience spoken of in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Elsewhere obedience is spoken of in a shallow way because the speakers have not touched God's authority themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This obedience only touches men; it is not directly linked to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No matter where we go, there is plenty of opportunity for us to obey and submit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There should be an inner longing within us to look for objects of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Love, mercy, and meekness should be our very nature; so should obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a person does not have the opportunity to express his love, he feels unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The same can be said of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Within us there is a longing to submit to others, and as soon as we find the object of our submission, we are relieved and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is to walk according to our very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Unless we can express this very nature of obedience, we cannot be entrusted with any authority.</S>
