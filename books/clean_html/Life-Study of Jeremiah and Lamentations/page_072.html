<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Reaction of the Prophet,<br>Who Was One with the Punishing Jehovah</H2><P>Verses 17 and 18 reveal the reaction of the prophet, who was one with the punishing Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Oneness of Jeremiah and Jehovah</H2><P>In verse 17 Jehovah said to the prophet, "You shall speak this word to them, / Let my eyes run down with tears / Night and day, and let them not cease; / For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with great brokenness, / A very grievous wound." Here we see that Jehovah and the prophet were joined as one. The prophet was one with the punishing God to sympathize with the people. On the one hand, God punished them; on the other hand, God was still sympathetic, and the prophet was one with Him in being sympathetic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Prophet Not Knowing Where to Go</H2><P>In verse 18 we have the word of the prophet. "If I go forth into the field, / Then behold, those slain by the sword; / And if I come into the city, / Then behold, those diseased with famine. / For both the prophet and the priest / Will go about in a land that they do not know." This indicates that the prophet felt that there was no place where he could stay. He did not know where to go.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Prophet's Further Intercession</H2><P>Verses 19 through 22 record the prophet's further intercession. Verse 21 says, "Do not hold us in contempt, for Your name's sake; / Do not dishonor Your throne of glory; / Remember and do not break Your covenant with us." This word indicates that Jeremiah's intercession was based upon Jehovah's name, His throne of glory, and His covenant. Verse 22 continues, "Are there among the vanities of the nations any that can bring rain, / Or in the heavens any that can give showers? / Are You not He, O Jehovah our God? / Therefore we wait for You, / For You have made all these things." Here we see that Jeremiah's intercession was based also upon Jehovah's power to bless His people. Furthermore, this verse indicates that the prophet's intercession was with the waiting of the people for Him.</P>
