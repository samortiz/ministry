   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. By Destroying the Idols</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 23:24 says, Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars lit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. This indicates clearly that the children of Israel were to destroy all the idols in the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have anything within us which is an idol replacing the Lord, that thing will be a snare to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, we must overthrow it and break it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No idols are allowed in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nothing is permitted to replace the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything that occupies the place of the Lord within us is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would take possession of the all-inclusive Christ for our experience, we must destroy all idols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>E. By Jehovah s Complete Care 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Blessing His People s Food and Water</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 25 and 26 we see Jehovah s complete care for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 25 says, And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water lit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>. God promised to bless His people s food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without food and drink it would have been impossible for His people to take possession of the land and live in it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same is true in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without proper food and drink we cannot enjoy Christ, experience Christ, gain Christ, and possess Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our food is the Word and our drink is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord s recovery today is very much under God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We certainly have the blessed Word and the blessed Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you visit a group of Christians and see that the Word and the Spirit are blessed there, you should say, Lord, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only by having the blessed Word and Spirit can we take possession of Christ, enjoying Him, experiencing Him, and obtaining Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah for the Word and the Spirit as our food and drink!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a sign of God s care.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Taking Sickness Away from Them</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 23:25 the Lord said, I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sickness makes us weak, it hinders our growth, and it may even cause us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Corinthians 11:30 Paul refers to certain believers who became weak, sick, or died.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord Jesus came, there was widespread sickness among God s people: blindness, deafness, dumbness, and paralysis.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today many Christians are spiritually blind, deaf, dumb, or paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you healthy spiritually?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How is your spiritual eyesight and your spiritual hearing?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you healthy in your speech and activities?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of today s Christians are paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spiritually, it is impossible for them to move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only when we are healthy in our spiritual seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving are we able to take possession of Christ, experience Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The proper church life is a healthy life, a life without blindness, deafness, dumbness, or paralysis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are spiritually healthy in every way, we shall be able to take possession of Christ as the good land and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Granting Them Multiplication</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 23:26 God promised, There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land lit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>. This means that God promised to give the people multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They would not only grow and produce, but also multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Multiplication here has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, it means to produce fruit; second, it means that one s growth is multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not simply grow we should be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Usually when someone grows spiritually, he is also multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the promise in 23:26, to be multiplied means not to have any miscarriages.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is possible for saints to have a spiritual miscarriage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For a while, some may grow quite well in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But suddenly they have a spiritual miscarriage, and this causes their growth in life for production to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Another problem is spiritual barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some Christians may have a spiritual miscarriage, but others are barren.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They do not bear any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all need to grow constantly and to produce without miscarriage.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is sad to see a brother who is the same today as he was many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is spiritually barren.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With him there is no multiplication, no reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is also sad to see those who do well for a period of time, only to have a sudden spiritual miscarriage.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need to pray, Lord, I take Your word as a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I stand against spiritual miscarriage and barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord I want to produce, to multiply without miscarriage.</S>
