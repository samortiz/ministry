Keeping the Earth from Being Fully Corrupted</h2><p>For us to be the salt of the earth means that we keep the earth from being fully corrupted. This means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition. The earth, which was created by God, has become fallen. In a sense, it has become rotten and corrupted. But salt kills germs, eliminates rottenness, and preserves things in their original condition. By nature salt is an element that kills the germs of corruption and eliminates them. Thus, through its killing and preserving function salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition. Hence, the function of salt is to preserve what God has created. The entire earth is becoming more and more rotten. Therefore, we must exercise our influence over this corrupted earth. To the corrupted earth the people of the kingdom of the heavens are the element that keeps the earth from being fully corrupted. They have the salting function of killing germs, eliminating rottenness, and keeping things in their original condition or bringing them back to their God-created condition.<p>The Lord&#8217;s intention is to bring this earth back to its original condition. Although we cannot see this in the present age, we shall see it in the next age. When the millennial kingdom comes, the whole earth will be salted. All the germs on earth will be utterly killed, and the whole earth will be not only regained by Christ but also brought back to its God-created condition. This work will be done by the kingdom people.<p>Wherever the kingdom people are, they should exercise a salting influence over those around them. In our neighborhoods we should exercise our function of killing germs. If we have the nature of the kingdom people revealed in Matthew 5:3-12, we shall be truly salty. If we are poor in spirit, mourning, meek, righteous, merciful, and pure in seeking God, we shall have a salting function. There will be no need to rebuke others or point out their mistakes and shortcomings. They will be salted simply by our presence. This is what it means to be the salt that kills the germs of this corrupted earth.<h2 class=head1>E. LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class=head2>1. People of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>In Matthew 5:14a the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;You are the light of the world.&#8221; This light is also the people of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers living a kingdom life to shine in the darkness of the world. In nature the kingdom people are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light.<h2 class=head2>2. Shining in the Darkness of the World</h2><p>In Matthew 5:13 the Lord Jesus speaks of the earth and in verse 14, of the world. For the earth there is the need of salt, but for the world there is the need of light. The darkness is not upon the earth; rather, it is in the world, which denotes human society, a system of Satan. The world, Satan&#8217;s system, the dark human society, needs light. The light of the world in verse 14 is the shining of a lamp to enlighten those in darkness. To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such a light effacing its darkness.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 099-113) &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
