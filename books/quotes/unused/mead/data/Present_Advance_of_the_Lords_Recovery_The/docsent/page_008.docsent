   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING REVIVED EVERY MORNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, we need to devote ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we need to be revived every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After coming into the Lord s recovery, we appreciated and treasured the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was our church life honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later we became contented and self-satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today for the new way, we need to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to start our Christian life anew and forget about the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not linger in the past, always talking about how wonderful it was when we came into the recovery many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must take care of today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may have been living in the past, but what about today?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may be deadened, dormant, sleeping, and even sleepy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The past does not help us today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need something today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we have to be alive, living, fresh, and new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A co-worker once told me that a good point with me is that I am always fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I do not feel that I am new and fresh, I become very fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Something must be wrong with me if I am not so fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regardless of how old we are in our physical age, we can still be fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Corinthians 4:16 indicates that our inward man should be renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a daily revival.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way for us to be revived is to go to the Lord to confess our sins and to pray through.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do these two things, we will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be revived every morning is not only scriptural but also according to the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the law of nature, the sun rises once every twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to rise up with the sun every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is good for our health to go to sleep early and rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The earlier we go to bed, the healthier we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not like to go to bed after 10:30 p.m. or rise up later than 6:30 a.m. If we go to bed late and rise up late, our health will be spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need to practice going to bed early and rising early for our spiritual health.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every twenty-four hours there is a new day for us to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lamentations 3:22-23 says that the Lord s lovingkindnesses and compassions are new every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may be in a situation full of lamentations, yet we can be happy by having ourselves revived every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Proverbs 4:18 says that the path of the righteous is as the rising sun.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to follow the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the sun sets, we should go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the sun rises, we should rise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every morning we need a new revival.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>LIVING AN OVERCOMING LIFE DAILY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the Lord s present recovery, we need to live an overcoming life daily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some have said that the new way to preach the gospel by knocking on doors is just a method, but I am not teaching the saints a set of methods.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To take the new way, we need another life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new way is a matter of life, not a matter of method.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we practice the fellowship in this chapter, we will be different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we devote ourselves to the Lord, get revived every morning, and live an overcoming life daily, we will be in full agreement with the present advance of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can live an overcoming life daily by enjoying Christ as the tree of life Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the churches became degraded, the Lord not only rebuked them but also called for the overcomers to come back to eating Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eating Christ as the tree of life is the first item of the Lord s sevenfold promise to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first item of His promise is to feed us with Himself as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we answer His call to be an overcomer, we will really enjoy Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also live an overcoming life daily by calling on the Lord continuously, without ceasing Rom 10:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can call on the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our calling on Him is like our physical breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We breathe at all times and in any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we stop breathing for a short time, we will die.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In like manner, we must breathe in the Lord by calling on Him continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is calling us to be the overcomers, so we must answer His call by calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By this simple practice, we can live an overcoming life day by day.</S>
