<h2 class="head1">FORMING GROUPS</h2>
<p>The groups are crucial, and we must take care of them. All the local churches should go over their name lists to see how many saints in their localities meet regularly and how many are no longer meeting. Then the saints who meet regularly should be formed into groups. Every group should have only twelve saints at the most. Thus, when the groups are formed, they should have less than twelve saints so that they can bring in new ones. There should be no group leaders or coordinators, because all the saints are coordinators. After the groups are formed, the full-time and part-time serving ones should be assigned to care for the groups. It is critical for the serving ones not to replace the saints.</p>
<p>For the care of the groups, we should do our best to form them according to the districts. For example, the church in Taipei will have more than four hundred small groups, which are formed by the ten districts. If each district has forty groups, there will be about four hundred saints in the groups. Every group needs full-time or part-time serving ones to help them. The groups should be formed according to where the saints live, and there should not be group leaders or coordinators. The saints in a group should live near one another, and one full-time or part-time serving one should be responsible for helping them. For example, the full-time and part-time serving ones can give the small groups material for their weekly meetings. They should teach the saints how to meet. These are some of the responsibilities of the full-time and part-time serving ones in the local churches. The saints in every local church can be formed into groups. The elders should take care of the administration of the entire church, and a few co-workers should take the lead in the districts. These are the principles for making arrangements in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
IN THE FULL-TIMERS&rsquo; WORK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Campus Work</h2>
<p>Concerning the campus work, we must consider how many campuses in a locality are ready for the serving ones and how many campuses are not. We also must know how many full-timers and other saints can serve. Then we can make appropriate arrangements.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Children&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>We must realize that the children&rsquo;s work is a crucial burden. Every locality must be aggressive in the children&rsquo;s work, because there is a greater future in the children&rsquo;s work than in the campus work. Generally speaking, it is easier to bring in children, and once they come in, they usually remain. Our history confirms this fact. The church in Manila is an example. Most of the saints in the church in Manila were gained by the children&rsquo;s work. Ninety percent of the churches in the Philippines are maintained by saints in their thirties, and most of these saints grew up in the church and attended the children&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we frequently have to go out to gain people; we even go to the campuses to gain people. These people are along the roads and hedges (Luke 14:23). There is only one group of people who are not along the roads: the children in our own homes. Why do we not work on our own children? The people along the roads might come today or tomorrow, but the people in our own homes will always be there. Furthermore, our children can bring other children. Therefore, they should be a crucial focus of our work. This work is long-lasting and remaining. A child who is six years old today will be thirteen in seven years. That is a good age to enter the church life. When they enter the church life, they are our young brothers and sisters. When they enter junior high school, they will be gospel seeds. Through them, it will be easier for us to work in the junior high schools.</p>
<p>If this is our vision, we will be aggressive in the children&rsquo;s work. The more children we have, the better it will be. If by the end of 1985 or the beginning of 1986 the church in Taipei has twenty thousand children, the church in Taipei will have a tremendous future. We must expand our view. This is something worth doing. Another benefit of the children&rsquo;s work is that we can bring the high school and college students into the coordination, and it will be easy for them to advance the work. Every local church must do its best to form small groups, begin the campus work, and develop the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Gospel in the Homes</h2>
<p>The gospel in the homes cannot be separated from the small groups. It has to be carried out by brothers and sisters who are capable and who have much time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Community Gospel</h2>
<p>The full-time serving ones also need to advance the community gospel. This is the most difficult item to carry out, and it requires everyone, including the elderly, the middle-aged, and the young saints. As many saints as are available should be used. The community gospel work is limitless. The local churches must make good arrangements concerning this aspect of the work by assigning full-time and part-time serving ones according to the need and by utilizing every saint, especially those with a profession. For example, if a certain brother teaches junior high school, he can help with the gospel work on that campus. If a saint is the owner of a factory, an engineer at a factory, or even a worker in a factory, he can contact people in the factory and preach the gospel. Some saints work in government offices and others in hospitals. They can spread the gospel where they work. The churches must assign full-time and part-time serving ones to coordinate with the saints.</p>
