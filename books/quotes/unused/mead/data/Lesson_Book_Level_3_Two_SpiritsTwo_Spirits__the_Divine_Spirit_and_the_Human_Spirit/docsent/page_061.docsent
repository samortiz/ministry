   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even a young student has to learn how to experience Christ in the study of his lesson books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He may pray, "Lord, here is the lesson book, and tomorrow will be the final.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, prove that You are one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, read this book with me."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he does this, I assure you he will experience Christ as his understanding and as his wisdom to take in all the secrets of his lesson book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will even experience Christ as his good memory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the next day when he takes the exam he does not need to be so pressed and so trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He just needs to pray, "Lord, I am one with You, and even one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only in speaking, Lord, even today in the classroom, taking the exam, I am one with You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, make it so real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Make it so real to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Make it so real to the entire universe that I am one with You."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I assure you that he will experience Christ as his wisdom and quite often as his answer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day by day we should cleave to the mingled spirit and do everything according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we walk according to the flesh we are sinners, no matter whether we regard ourselves as good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we need not walk according to the flesh, for we have the option of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we do this, we enjoy all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We daily need to practice having our being according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to apply this in our talking, in our thinking, and in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, suppose a young one is wondering whether he can participate in a certain kind of athletic activity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My advice to him would be that if he can participate in that athletic activity according to the spirit, then he should go ahead and do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As Christians, we should not decide matters according to right or wrong; rather, we should decide them according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit who is mingled with our spirit and according to whom we may have our very being is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a Spirit, the realization and application of the Triune God, is now mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is no longer a matter of simply the divine Spirit nor of just the human spirit, but it is a matter of the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah for this marvelous mingling!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We the believers are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is mingled, blended organically with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the mingling of divinity with humanity, the original natures are not lost and no third nature is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit witnesses with our spirit testifying that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every day we should walk according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>QUESTIONS What is one of the greatest verses in the Bible showing we are one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why does the word translated "spirit" in Romans 8:4 present a problem to translators of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What do we mean when we say the life-giving Spirit "mingles" with our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Does the mingling produce a third nature?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why does the Bible say the Spirit of God witnesses "with our spirit," and not "in our spirit"?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What does this show us?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why can we not tell if it is the Holy Spirit witnessing or if it is our spirit witnessing that we are the children of God?</S>
