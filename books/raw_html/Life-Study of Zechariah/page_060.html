<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Book of Zechariah</H2><P>The book of Zechariah reveals many things concerning Christ. First, the redeeming Christ, as a man and as the Angel of Jehovah, the embodiment of the Triune God, was sent by God to be with His humiliated people of Israel in their captivity, signified by the myrtle trees in the bottoms (1:8-11). Then Christ, as a man in His humanity, was the One sent by Jehovah of hosts and was also the Sender, Jehovah of hosts, dealing with the nations who plundered the people of Zion and touched them as touching the pupil of His eye (2:1, 8-10).</P><P>Following this, Christ was the Servant of Jehovah and the Shoot to be the stone with seven eyes engraved by God for the removing of the iniquity of the holy land for the building of the temple of God (3:8-9). Christ was also the topstone of grace for the completion of the building of the temple of God (4:7-9). Christ as the Shoot for the building of the temple of God will bear majesty and will sit and rule on His throne as a Priest and as a King (6:12-13).</P><P>Christ as the King of Israel came into Jerusalem lowly and riding upon a donkey, even upon a colt (9:9), yet Christ as the Shepherd of God's elect was rejected and sold at the price of a slave, thirty pieces of silver (11:12-13). Christ as God's Fellow was the God-sent Shepherd, but He was attacked unto death (13:7).</P><P>At His coming, Christ will appear to the children of Israel as their Redeemer and Savior, the One who was pierced by them, and they will look upon Him and wail over Him (12:10). Christ came as the real Prophet, but He was rejected and wounded by Israel, who were His relatives, to make the base for their salvation and an open fountain for their sin and their iniquity (13:5-6, 1).</P><P>At the end of this age, Christ will come to stand on the Mount of Olives and will fight with the nations that besiege Jerusalem (14:3-4). Then Christ as Jehovah will be King over all the earth in the millennium (v. 9).</P><P>The Christ unveiled in Zechariah, the pierced One with whom there is the open fountain, is the centrality and universality of God's economy. As such a One, He is intimately involved with human history, in particular with the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire especially has been helpful to Christ. Christ was born under the Roman Empire. Without the Roman Empire, it would not have been possible for Christ to be born. He grew up, carried out His ministry, was crucified, resurrected, and ascended under the Roman Empire. Christ's death for the accomplishment of God's eternal redemption was consummated under the Roman Empire. The formation of the church and the preaching of the gospel also took place under the Roman Empire. Surely, the Roman Empire, whose influence in law and culture continues today, has been used by God to fulfill His intention to make Christ the centrality and universality of His economy.</P>
