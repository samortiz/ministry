   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>About thirty years later, the aged John wrote the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After he finished writing concerning the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, God s visions were complete.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the end of Revelation, which is the end of the entire Bible, there is the warning against any further addition or deletion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the visions of God have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the book of Revelation was completed, three hundred years went by until in A.D. 397, at the Council of Carthage, the authority of the entire canon of the holy writings, including the books of Revelation and Hebrews, was recognized.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In A.D. 325 when Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea, the books of Revelation and Hebrews still had not been recognized as part of the canon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These two books occupy a pivotal position in the vision concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the creed produced at the Council of Nicaea did not include the revelation revealed in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today many Protestant and Catholic groups recite the Nicene Creed every Sunday in their services.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While I was in the West fighting for the truth concerning the Triune God, I told people, The creed that you hold is defective, for it does not say anything regarding the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They had nothing to say in response.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE BASIS OF THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By A.D. 397, the entire Bible was recognized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today this holy Word before us is full of visions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not we can come up to the standard of these visions depends entirely on our understanding of the visions contained in these sixty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the first sixteen hundred years of church history, countless numbers of lovers of the Lord were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regrettably, all these lovers of the Lord, all these servants of God, were not able to be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason for this is that the visions they saw were all different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some saw only the vision of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They liked it, and they faithfully adhered to that vision, but they did not advance any further.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some advanced a little and saw the vision of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spontaneously they became different from the first group, and they discovered that they could not fellowship with the first group.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Other people advanced to the different visions recorded in the different Epistles, and similarly they held different views from the previous groups.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Throughout the last sixteen centuries, many lovers of the Lord were raised up, yet they were not able to be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason is not that there was sin or evil among them, but that the vision each held was different in degree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Each remained in the degree to which they saw the various visions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the degree of the visions they saw was different, spontaneously there was no one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the nineteenth century, Hudson Taylor saw a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He felt that he should go to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot say that his vision was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can only say that his vision was not up to the standard of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the past three decades, we lost the one accord a number of times in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The case with Brother Austin-Sparks was one example of such a time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Can we say that he did not love the Lord or that he was not spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even today I still recommend his books.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of them are certainly worthwhile reading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, he did not see what Brother Nee led us to see in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Needless to say, all our differences were not caused by the flesh but by the difference in our visions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1958, there were some aspiring and promising young people who were saved and perfected through my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I entrusted to them the crucial works on the island of Taiwan, including hall three of the church in Taipei and the churches in Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaoshung.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They became proud, and through Brother Austin-Spark s influence, they decided to no longer speak concerning the ground of the church but to speak regarding only the fullness of Christ, the full Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They boldly proclaimed that they had seen a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, the one accord was truly lost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although Brother Austin-Sparks was spiritual, he limited himself to the scope of his vision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His problem was that he was unwilling to see more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, he considered all those who saw something different to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He tried all he could to annul the ground, which was recovered among us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He told me personally in a meeting that he had been speaking for decades, but in his whole life he had not found one place with such a good audience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He also discussed with me the possibility of moving to Taiwan to set up a ministry station.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the end, however, he and we were still not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason for this is that our visions were different.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE PRESENT VISION</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What then is our vision?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A young brother once said, Brother Nee used to speak of the cross, but we do not speak concerning it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a shortsighted remark.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who says that we no longer speak concerning the dealing of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By reading the messages on the New Jerusalem, we can see that in order to become the gates of pearl we must pass through the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to enjoy the secretion of the Lord s resurrection life through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only then can we become the pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, every one of the nineteen items in the book The Experience of Life involves dealings that are related to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to speak regarding the dealing of the cross, but we should not make this truth our limitation or our issue.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the West some people emphasize tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not oppose tongue-speaking, but if someone emphasizes tongue-speaking to the point of strongly promoting it, it becomes a great damage.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One may do this out of harmless zeal, but if his listeners receive his speaking and enlarge upon it, it will bring a problem into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must remember that the vision we have received does not concern itself with such small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not the focus of our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is our vision?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our vision is that God so loved the world that He gave His Son to die for us to redeem us, the sinners, in order that we can have the life of Christ and be regenerated by Him to be God s children, enjoying the riches of the Triune God to become the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In practice, the Body is expressed as the local churches in various localities, practicing the Body life in a practical and proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This Body, the church of God, is the focus of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the theology of the early church fathers there was such a term as economy, but in the Lord s recovery, during the period when we were in mainland China, we did not use this term.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It was twenty years ago that I first picked up this term in Taiwan, but it was only two years ago that we saw the entire New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At the same time, we saw the mingling of God and man and the divine dispensing, which is the Triune God dispensing all His riches in Christ as the Spirit into us to constitute us the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During the past few centuries, no one saw God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even if some did see it, no one spoke concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one spoke of the mingling of God and man, and no one spoke of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some spoke regarding sanctification, but that speaking was somewhat ambiguous.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>From the Bible we see that sanctification is of three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is separating sanctification, positional sanctification, and dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Dispositional sanctification is transformation, and transformation includes the dealing and breaking of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But even the inner-life Christians, including those attending the Keswick conferences and the many spiritual giants who have written on the subject of the spiritual life, did not clearly explain what transformation is.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The teaching of transformation is an item which is characteristic to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The vision that the Lord has given to His recovery is an all-inclusive one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It includes the economy of God, the mingling of God and man, the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and the believers salvation in Christ, including God s selection, calling, regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the history of the development of Christian doctrine, this entire set of truths finds its full recovery only among us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Such truths as selection, calling, regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification were not recovered much before us, and the recovery of these truths will not increase much after us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This set of truths has found its full recovery among us.</S>
