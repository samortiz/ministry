<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Eleven</H2><P>Verse 11: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death."</P><P>As before, the word of the Holy Spirit was spoken to the churches. However, it is only to those who have an ear that the command of "let him hear" is given (Matt. 13:9). Although the Holy Spirit continually speaks, there are few who can hear His words.</P><P>Here is an excellent spiritual lesson. These seven epistles were sent by the Lord Jesus to the seven churches. At the beginning of every epistle, it says that the Lord "says." The word "says" in 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, and 14 indicates that the seven epistles were all words that the Lord Jesus spoke. But at the end of all the epistles, the letters were considered words that "the Spirit says." What does this mean? Here is a great teaching. The word of the Lord Jesus is the record of the seven epistles. When He charged John to send the epistles to each church, He began by telling John to "write" (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). Hence, the words that the Lord Jesus speaks to the churches are the words that John wrote. In other words, they become the record of the Bible, the text of Revelation chapters two and three. The Lord Jesus has spoken; His words have been recorded and are written in the Bible. But now the Holy Spirit still must speak to the churches through these words. The Holy Spirit must speak to the church again from the written word. The Holy Spirit does not speak of Himself. Rather, He reiterates in man's heart the written word. When we read the Bible, we have to pay attention to this matter. It is true that in the Bible, we have the word of the Lord and the word of God already. However, we must still ask the Holy Spirit to speak the words within us. The reading of the Bible is for the purpose of receiving the Holy Spirit's speaking. If we only read the Bible but do not have the speaking of the Holy Spirit, our reading will be in vain. We must allow the Holy Spirit to speak His word through the written text. God has spoken in the Bible already. But we must allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us again from God's spoken word. Everyone who waits on God faithfully has the experience of the Holy Spirit speaking to him through the Bible. The word of God, the Bible, is general. We must have the Holy Spirit to appoint certain of God's words for our application according to our need. When we read the Bible, we realize its general goodness. But when the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within, we receive unspeakable teachings, rebukes, comforts, and encouragements. When the Holy Spirit speaks to us through one or two verses, we receive special revelation. What we previously thought we have understood is now seen as being superficial. Now, it seems as if the heart and marrow of the Scripture is opened to us. Hence, in the reading of the Bible, it is not a matter of the quantity read, or the familiarity that counts; neither are we reading for the sake of knowledge. The reading of the Bible is for the purpose of receiving the speaking of the Holy Spirit. As the resurrected Savior expounded the Scripture to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus and caused their hearts to burn within them, in the same way the Spirit who has been sent also opens the Bible to all the believers, enlightening the word and pricking the believers' hearts with it. When we realize this, we will prepare ourselves by prayer and meditation. In this way, the Holy Spirit will be able to speak to us the words of the Bible.</P><P>"He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death." This is a promise. Those who overcome have a secured position. The second death, which is the death of judgment, shall not hurt them. The second death is the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8). Nothing can hurt these ones except the first death of the physical body. Hence, we do not have to be afraid of the first death. It is only a servant that leads us to God. The Lord is the ancient wood which was cast into the bitter waters at Marah. He Himself has passed through the pain of death and has turned it into sweetness.</P><P>To be free from the hurt of the second death means to be free from the hurt of the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). The lake of fire is what we commonly know as hell. Those who will not be hurt of the lake of fire will have a part in the first resurrection; they are qualified to enjoy the blessing of the millennium. This can be proved from Revelation: "Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years" (20:6). Here we see two blessed ends of the overcomers. Negatively, they are saved from all God's wrath and will not be touched at all by it. Positively, they will receive a crown and will reign with Christ for a thousand years.</P><P>These promises, as do all the other promises in the other epistles, divide the believers in the church into overcomers and those who are overcome. These promises are particular. Not every overcomer will receive all the promises. Only by overcoming certain trials will one receive certain particular promises related to those trials. The promise here is given to those who are imprisoned and killed for Christ. The distinction between the overcomers and those who are overcome is fully attested to by the experience of the church. We know that there have been many sincere ones who believed in Christ for eternal life but shrank back and denied the Lord at difficult times through their physical weaknesses. It is possible, though it ought not be, that regenerated believers may deny Christ. The distinction between the overcomers and those who are overcome is an unremovable fact. If Peter was not regenerated at an earlier time, at least by the time he confessed that Christ was the Son of God (Matt. 16:16) he was regenerated already (1 John 5:1). However, he denied Christ with an oath. We thank the Lord that at crucial moments, there are indeed overcomers. However, there are also many who have been overcome and have retreated. The persecutors always say: "Give up your faith or you will die!" Those who insist on their faith and who die graciously overcome and glorify God. Moreover, they strengthen their brothers' hearts. But if they deny the most holy name of the Lord, they fail and are overcome, and God and the destiny of His church are put to shame. According to the text here, only those who have overcome and who have not denied the Lord can escape the hurt of the second death, which is hell. Those who fail and who have denied the Lord will suffer the hurt of the second death. This is the word of the Bible, and it is clear enough. Yet does this mean that a saved person will perish forever just because he has denied the Lord? No, this is not the biblical teaching, nor is it our teaching. On the one hand, the Bible teaches us that a Christian once saved, is forever saved. All those who have believed the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior are eternally saved. They will by no means perish at all. If a saint could perish forever, this would diminish the merit of the cross of Christ, and would annul God's promise completely. However, on the other hand, we cannot say that a sinning Christian will have no punishment other than the losing of his reward (1 Cor. 3:15). As far as I know, the Bible teaches us on the one hand the eternal salvation of the saints, but on the other hand it also teaches us of the punishment for the failing and sinning Christian. We should believe in all the words of the Bible. In our exposition of the Scripture, we should give the biblical truth its rightful place. We must not cut off portions of the Scripture to fit our theory of exposition. Those people whose minds are more inclined to righteousness explain away the Scriptures on eternal salvation. They claim that if a Christian sins again, he will be lost again. Those people whose minds are bent more towards grace explain away the texts that cover God's judgment on the sinning Christians. They claim that Christians will always be saved. The former group despises God's precious promises, and emphasizes God's warning to the defeated believers. The latter changes the meaning of the texts by their way of exposition, claiming that God's warnings are issued not to the saved believers but to the nominal ones only. The former ones do not understand the doctrine of regeneration and the grace of redemption, whereas the latter ones through their prejudice subconsciously make their exposition a kind of alteration. Both are wrong. We cannot go into detail concerning this matter. Here we can only discuss it in brief.</P>
