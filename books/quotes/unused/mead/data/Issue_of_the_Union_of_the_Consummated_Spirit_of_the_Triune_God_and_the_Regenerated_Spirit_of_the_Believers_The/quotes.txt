[1]  CONTENTS The Consummated Spirit of the Triune God The Regenerated Spirit of the Believers The Union of the Spirit of God and the Spirit
[2]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for gathering us once again that we may be assembled together in You.
[3]  In this series of messages my central burden can be expressed in a sentence, that is, "The life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God comes to regenerate, sanctify, renew, and transform the believers, to conform them to the image of the Son of God, and eventually to glorify them with the eternal glory of God that the Son of God may be the Firstborn among His many brothers, the many sons of God; thus, they become the many God-men to constitute the Body of Christ and consummately be enlarged and built up as the New Jerusalem."
[4]  First we need to see the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.
[5]  However, the Spirit as an ointment requires many elements to be mingled together to become a compound ointment, which includes the elements of the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ.
[6]  THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT, THROUGH THE PRAYERS AND PETITIONS OF THE BELIEVERS, MINGLING WITH
[7]  These eighteen statuses are 1 God; 2 the Triune God; 3 the Holy Spirit; 4 becoming man; 5 passing through human living; 6 passing through death; 7 resurrecting from death; 8 ascending to the height of the heavens; 9 becoming the life-giving Spirit the Spirit of life; 10 becoming the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment; 11 becoming the consummation of the Triune God; 12 becoming the Lord Spirit; 13 becoming the Spirit; 14 becoming the Spirit of Jesus Christ; 15 becoming the Spirit of reality; 16 as the Spirit in the word of God; 17 as the outpoured Spirit the mantle Spirit the Spirit of power; 18 becoming the seven Spirits.
[8]  OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 3:16; 2:1, 5-6; John 3:5-6; 1 Pet 1:3; John 3:36a; Gal 2:20a; Eph 2:22; 3:16b-17a; John 14:23b; 4:24; Rom 1:9; 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22; Eph 1:17; 3:5; Rev 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; Eph 4:23; 5:18; 1 Cor 6:17 OUTLINE In God's old creation the spirit of man is the reality of man and not the person of man Gen 2:7.
[9]  In God's new creation the spirit of the believers is the person of the man of the new creation the inner man of the believers 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 3:16: Being dead in sins Eph 2:1.
[10]  Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, living in the believers to be the person of the believers as the new creation Gal 2:20a.
[11]  The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God in them Eph 2:22 , and it also becomes their inner man Eph 3:16b , in which Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God dwells 2 Tim 4:22 and from which He spreads to make His home in their heart Eph 3:17a ; this is the processed and consummated Triune God's making an abode in the believers John 14:23b .
[12]  Prayer: Lord, we not only worship You as the speaking God, but even more we worship You that You are the Word and this Word is the Spirit.
[13]  When the reality of this Spirit enters into us to be our element, it makes us God.
[14]  He is also the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:17-18 , the Spirit John 7:38-39; Rev 22:17 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b , the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 1 John 5:6b , the Spirit in the Word John 6:63; Eph 6:17-18a , the mantle Spirit poured upon the believers, that is, the Spirit of power Acts 2:18, 33; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:12b-15 , and finally, the seven Spirits Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .
[15]  I. IN GOD'S OLD CREATION THE SPIRIT OF MAN IS
[16]  THE REALITY OF MAN AND NOT THE PERSON OF MAN
[17]  THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS HAS: A. The Life of God as the Second Life,
[18]  If God does not dwell in man, God will not be able to become man; if man does not dwell in God, neither will man be able to become God.
[19]  V. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS BECOMES THE ORGAN FOR THEM TO WORSHIP, SERVE, RECEIVE, POSSESS, EXPERIENCE, AND ENJOY GOD
[20]  Our regenerated spirit within us is the organ for us to receive God that we may contact Him, worship Him, serve Him, and even possess Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him.
[21]  Today, the Spirit of God and the human spirit are mingled as one within us so that we can live a God-man life, a life that is God yet man and man yet God.
[22]  AND THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; 1:12-13; 3:15-16; Matt 16:24; Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet 1:4; Titus 3:5b; Rom 12:2a; 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 6:4; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:29, 30, 23; Eph 4:30; Col 3:4b; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Tim 2:10; Heb 2:10 OUTLINE The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers brings God into man that God and man may be joined and mingled together divinity and humanity blended as one, without a third nature being produced.
[23]  That, in addition to their natural life, the believers may have the eternal life of God and live by it while denying their natural life John 3:15-16; Matt 16:24.
[24]  That by passing through the death of Christ on the cross, the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, and the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, the believers may be renewed day by day by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 6:4.
[25]  In transforming the believers 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2a: Transforming the believers metabolically with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until they are transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory Phil 3:21.
[26]  In conforming the believers Rom 8:29: Conformation is the consummation of the transformation of the believers in the life of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man.
[27]  This is the central point of this series of messages.
[28]  We have used this term union quite much, but concerning the union of God and man, we do not have adequate knowledge.
[29]  IN SANCTIFYING THE BELIEVERS A. Dispensing God's Holy Nature
[30]  IN RENEWING THE BELIEVERS A. Infusing the Inward Parts
[31]  The Spirit of God infuses into us the divine attributes, which are forever new, never become old, and are everlasting and unfading, that we may pass through the death of Christ on the cross and the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, plus the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, to be renewed day by day by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation.
[32]  The transformation of the believers is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man to make every believer a God-man just like Christ, the firstborn Son of God.
[33]  Hence, the Spirit of God transforms the believers into the likeness of God.
[34]  Therefore, we can see that in the four steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation, the Spirit of God is working step by step in our human spirit to make us God-men.
[35]  Conformation is the consummation of the transformation of the believers in the life of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, which is just the consummation of the four steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation.
[36]  In this meeting it is not man speaking human words but God speaking the words of God.
[37]  Christianity preaches the gospel by human work, human effort, human doing; but Paul preached the gospel by supplying the person being saved by him with the Spirit of God, so that within him he might have God, the life of God, and also Christ.
[38]  The building up of the Body of Christ is a constitution, in the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, of the processed and consummated Triune God with the tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image.
[39]  We all need to see what the Body of Christ is.
[40]  The Body of Christ is not the totality of all the churches added together.
[41]  Verses 3 through 6 in Ephesians 4 first speak of the basic nature of the Body, with the redeemed people as the outward framework and the redeeming God as the inward element.
[42]  Such a building also requires the participating men, in their redeemed and resurrected humanity, to experience the co-death with Christ so that the attributes of the participating God can be manifested from within the participating men in resurrection to be their virtues.
[43]  This is also the building up of the Body of Christ arrived at by all the God-men as the members of Christ in their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things: Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply Eph 4:16a.
[44]  Prayer: Lord, we really love You; we also love Your word and Your speaking.
[45]  We are sitting quietly before You to listen to Your speaking again.
[46]  We want to be here listening to God speaking the word of God.
[47]  Actually, a Christian is not single-natured but dual-natured.
[48]  A Christian has humanity and divinity; he is man yet God, man plus God.
[49]  Since we are God-men, our living is not merely the living of God but also the living of human beings; it is not merely the living of human beings but also the living of God.
[50]  THIS IS THE LIVING WHICH A GOD-MAN CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF GOD'S FIRSTBORN SON SHOULD HAVE IN EXPERIENCING THE CO-DEATH
[51]  The union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man produce this kind of building of the co-living and co-walking of God and man, which is the living that a God-man conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son should have in experiencing the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ.
[52]  C. Causing the Growth of the Body of Christ
[53]  OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:4b; Eph 1:10; 3:9; John 14:9-20; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-5; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev 22:17; John 3:15-16; Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 10:32; Rom 6:4-6; Eph 4:22-24; Phil 3:10; 1:19-21; Matt 16:24; Gal 5:24; Rom 8:3; Heb 2:14; John 12:31; Gal 1:4; Rom 12:2; 5:17, 21; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Matt 16:18-19; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11; 1 Cor 1:10-13; 10:16-17; 9:1-3; 1 Tim 3:1-13; 1:3-4; Rom 14:17 OUTLINE The first aspect of the Lord's recovery the revelation of God: Concerning the eternal economy of God 1 Tim 1:4b; Eph 1:10; 3:9.
[54]  The second aspect of the Lord's recovery the God-man life: The life lived out by the believers, who have been regenerated to become God-men, not by the life of their old man but by the divine life in their new man Rom 6:4-6; Eph 4:22-24.
[55]  Prayer: Lord, You are the Alpha and You are also the Omega.
[56]  After the first group of apostles, in church history there were the so-called church fathers, who defended the truths.
[57]  However, among the church fathers, because of inadequate light, there was always much contention concerning the truths.
[58]  The divine revelation in the Bible is the content of the Lord's recovery.
[59]  For this plan, God made an administrative arrangement, which is His administrative management for dispensing Himself through the processed and consummated all-inclusive Spirit into His chosen, regenerated, sanctified, and transformed tripartite men so that they can become God in life and nature yet with no share in His Godhead.
[60]  The fifth major item in the divine revelation concerns the eternal life of God John 3:15-16 .
[61]  We obtained this eternal life from God through believing in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[62]  A. Being the Life Lived Out by the Believers,
[63]  The God-man life is also one that is conformed daily to the death of Christ by the power of Christ's resurrection and lives and magnifies Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 3:10; 1:19-21 .
[64]  F. The Local Churches in the Various Localities Take God's Eternal Economy as Their Center
