THE GOD OF CHANGELESSNESS</H2><P>God is also the God of changelessness in keeping the principle of His grace, in recognizing Isaac, Abraham's son of Sarah, as his only son, in His ninth speaking to Abraham (Gen. 21:1-12). The God of Abraham is the God of changelessness in keeping His word, His promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. THE GOD WITH HIS TRIAL</H2><P>Genesis 22:1-10 reveals the God with His trial, in proving Abraham, His intimate human friend, by asking him to present his only son, whom he loved, for a burnt offering to God, in His tenth speaking to Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI.

THE GOD OF FRIENDSHIP ON THE HUMAN LEVEL</H2><P>The God of Abraham is seen as the God of friendship on the human level, in leading the old servant of His friend Abraham to secure a wife for his son Isaac (Gen. 24). Though this was not directly motivated by God, it was carried out by God. Abraham charged his old servant to find Isaac a wife, and his old servant did it by following God's leading.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The History of God in His Union With Man &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
