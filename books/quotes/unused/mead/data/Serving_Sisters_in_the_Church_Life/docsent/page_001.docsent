   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SERVING SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 16:1-2, 3-4, 6, 12b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The divine word in God's revelation is always very economical.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In every case, not one word is wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every page, every line, even every word in this holy Book is valuable and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Based on this principle, we must consider Romans 16 just as important as Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all value Romans 6 highly, and we know what is revealed there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But very few of you are clear about Romans 16.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 16 is not a short chapter, but a chapter with twenty-seven verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are no doctrines covered in Romans 16 no justification, no redemption, no reconciliation, no sanctification, no glorification, no -ation of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this chapter is full of names, with name after name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tonight we want to pick up five names from this chapter with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PHOEBE AND PRISCA</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The number one name is Phoebe, which is the best name among all the female names.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second name is Prisca, the Greek spelling for Priscilla, a dear name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do love these two names.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first one was given by me to my first daughter, because I did know this name was a good name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second name, Priscilla, was given to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The name not only means the name; the reality of the name is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third name is a brother's name, Aquila, the husband of Prisca, Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the principle in the Bible, the husband's name always comes before the wife's name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in this case, altogether against the divine principle, the wife's name comes first, and then the husband's. It seems to break the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this couple is first mentioned in Acts 18, Aquila is named first, and then Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I was young, when I came to Romans, I questioned which one was the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I even thought there must be a mistake in some manuscript.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there is a definite reason for this arrangement in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>MARY AND PERSIS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fourth name is a very familiar name, Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are at least six Marys in the New Testament, and the Mary in Romans 16 is the sixth one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mary is the New Testament form of the Old Testament name Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first Mary is the mother of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another is Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She had been possessed by seven demons, and those demons were cast out by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She was released, and from that time she became a real seeker of the Lord, one who loved Him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet another Mary is the mother of John Mark in Acts 12.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here are four Marys: the Mary in Romans 16, the mother of Jesus, Mary the Magdalene, and the mother of John Mark in Acts 12.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition to these, there are another two Marys.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The six Marys cover the Christian life and the church life as well, starting from the incarnation of Christ and consummating in the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The incarnation of Christ started with the first Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the Mary in Romans 16 is the consummation of the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the first Mary to the last Mary, all of the Christian life and the church life is fully covered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mary is the fourth name we want to pick up, and the fifth is Persis, in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Probably none of you has ever paid attention to this name, and many do not know that Persis is a female name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A sister by the name of Persis was greeted purposely by the Apostle Paul in Romans 16.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this chapter there are a number of names in addition to these five that we have picked up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because not one word is wasted in the holy Bible, we must consider these names in the greetings of the Apostle Paul as something very practical.</S>
