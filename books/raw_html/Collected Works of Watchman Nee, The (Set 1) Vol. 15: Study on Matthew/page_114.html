<P>Verse 21:"His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master." If we read only verse 20, it would seem that the reward depends solely on the gaining of other talents. However, we can see clearly in verse 21 that the reward is based primarily on being good and faithful. Therefore, we can all be good and faithful, whether we have received five talents, two talents, or only one talent. To be "good and faithful" does not refer to being a good Christian. It refers to being a good and faithful slave. The "other five talents" does not indicate success. It indicates the goodness and the faithfulness of the slave. Superficially, Stephen failed; but according to the spiritual fact, he accomplished a good and faithful work. That is why offering only a cup of cold water in the name of the Lord (Matt. 10:42) will be rewarded for faithfulness. To be faithful is simply to be wholly for the Lord. Those who are faithful will receive the reward. Even though we are working, we need to ask ourselves, "For whom are we working?" Many times our desire for success is merely to gain the other five talents, not knowing that all successes that are not according to the Lord are still wood, hay, and stubble. The Lord desires that we be faithful. "Well done" is the Lord's praise. We want only to hear the Lord say, "Well done." We endure and suffer because we look forward to this "well done." The Lord's "well done" is priceless. Actually, it is impossible to place a value on it, for our own estimation of our goodness may be faulty.</P><P>"You were faithful over a few things" (v. 21). "A few things" refers to the work of this age. This means that even with the five-talented one, there is not as much work for him today as there will be for him in the kingdom. The "many things" in verse 21 refers to the things of the kingdom. However, we often misunderstand and wrongly consider the Lord's work today to be too vast. The church can be compared to a school, and the believers, to the students who are learning in it. The believers will be dispatched after graduation into the future kingdom to apply what they have learned. Therefore, we can have a foretaste today of the authority of the coming age.</P><P>"Enter into the joy of your master" (v. 21). Compare this verse with Hebrews 12:2. Why is joy mentioned here, but not the kingdom? This is because the reward for faithfulness is inward satisfaction, not outward position. To rejoice with the Lord is the greatest reward, even better than the glory and position in the kingdom, for both we and the Lord are satisfied.</P><P>"I will set you over many things" (v. 21). The word "over" refers to authority. Today is the time to be faithful, and the future will be the time to take authority. Those who are eager to take authority today are just like the evil slave mentioned in chapter twenty-four. God cannot give authority to those who love authority; instead, God gives authority to those who desire to obey. To rule is a matter of the kingdom. On the one hand, we are joyful, and one the other hand, we have authority. The Lord will give us joy to fill up our suffering while yet on this earth. He will give us authority to fill up our losses while living in this world. One who is faithful will definitely bear losses. We cannot be the rich man while living and be Lazarus after our death (see Luke 16:19-26).</P><P>Verse 22-23:"And he who had received the two talents also came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master." The words spoken to the one who received two talents are exactly the same as those spoken to the one who received five talents. Not even one word is different. Why the repetition? It is to show us that the Lord pays attention not to success and quantity but to faithfulness. Because of this, the reward given to the one who had received five talents is the same as the reward to the one who had received two talents, for they showed the same faithfulness. What the Lord requires is five talents from the one who received five talents, and two from the one who received two. The reward bears no relationship with the amount of the gift as long as one is faithful in service. One who invests his gift will never suffer loss. Our only responsibility to the Lord is to be faithful. Do not admire those who have more gifts, and do not spend time considering that you have lesser gifts. The amount of one's gift is determined by the Lord. The Lord requires more from those who receive more, and less from those who receive less. The Lord rewarded the one who had five talents not because he had five talents, but because he had been faithful. In the eyes of the worldly people, the difference between the first and the second servant is six talents. However, the spiritual mathematics is the same, 5/5 and 2/2. Any believer can receive the same reward. Even though we do not have a gift such as Paul had (our gift can never match his), our reward can be the same as his because we have the same opportunity to serve faithfully. Our hearts can receive the most comfort from the one who received the two talents, for our gift may be less than what others receive, yet our faithfulness should equal theirs.</P><P>Verse 24:"Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow." Was the one who received the one talent saved or not? Surely he was saved. The reasons are: (1) If he were not saved, then everyone (including the unsaved) could receive a reward. (2) If he were not saved, the Lord would be telling us that there is no punishment for a Christian's failure. (3) This one was called the Lord's own slave and therefore had been redeemed by the blood. The Lord cannot choose an unsaved one to be His slave. The Holy Spirit could not use the wrong words. (4) How could the Lord deliver His possessions to the unsaved? (5) When this one received punishment, the Lord still called him a slave, albeit a useless one. Useless does not mean false. (6) He received judgment for his work, not for his believing or not believing. If he were not saved, how could the Lord judge his work? The Lord should then judge his contempt for the precious blood. If he could be counted as saved only after he gained an extra talent, then salvation would not be based on faith. (7) Who were those who were judged with him at the same time? They were the saved who received the reward. Can an unsaved one be judged at the same time as a saved one? No, all those who are judged at the judgment seat of Christ must be saved. (8) If he were not a saved one, the Lord could not rebuke him concerning his unfaithfulness, or for not taking his talent to do the Lord's business, or for not using his gift. The Lord cannot rebuke the unsaved ones for not preaching the gospel. The Lord prefers that they not preach. The deeper they bury their service, the better. (9) The Lord's coming refers to His descending. The slave's coming refers to his being raptured to the air. Can the raptured ones be unsaved? (10) The Lord's judgment is based on the matter of faithfulness, not on the matter of believing. Can the Lord ask the unsaved to be faithful? (11) The Lord did not send anyone to bring him. It was he himself who came forth. He was not afraid to show up before the Lord. An unbeliever will not dare to see the Lord. He would rather have the rocks fall on him. He did not lose even one dollar of the Lord's money. He made his own living and considered that he deserved merit and was without fault. (12) This parable is identical with the one in Luke 19. In Luke the unfaithful slave is clearly distinct from the unbelievers, and there is no confusion.</P><P>Someone may ask why he was cast into outer darkness. Is this not hell? If it means hell, the "darkness" should be changed to the "lake of fire," which will come after the millennium, whereas this event takes place before the millennium.</P>
