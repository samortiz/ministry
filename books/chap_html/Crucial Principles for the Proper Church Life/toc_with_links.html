<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages spoken by Brother Witness Lee in Washington, D. C., from August 29 through September 1, 1978. From July through September 1978 Brother Lee visited many localities in the United States and Canada, giving a series of conferences to meet a timely need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. His two main burdens in these conferences were the believers&rsquo; personal contact with the Lord as branches abiding in the vine, and the vision and practice of the proper church life.</p>
