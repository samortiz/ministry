   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Confess Regarding the Point of the Purpose to Be Dealt With</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we ascertain that the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in dealing with us is a certain problem, we should confess it seriously before the Lord with regard to that particular problem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Were it not for that problem and difficulty we would have no need for the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the Holy Spirit arranges the environment to discipline us concerning a specific point, we must realize that it is in that specific point that we have a problem before God, either because we are stubborn or proud, stiff-necked or disobedient, not willing to pay the price, or not willing to deny self; it is either one thing or the other which must be removed or broken, dealt with or torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At any rate, there exists a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember that the discipline of the Holy Spirit never causes us to suffer without a reason; rather it is always because there are areas within us which require dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit had already anointed us many times, perhaps, yet we disobeyed; therefore, He has arranged such a discipline to assist His inward anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, once we discover the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we should have a thorough confession regarding the point in view.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>D. Submit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we confess our sin, we must submit through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This submission implies acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After we see that the purpose of this discipline is to deal with a specific point, we must submit ourselves in that particular point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is only then that we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>E. Worship</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we need to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Worship is the highest form of gratitude.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to worship God for His work in us and His way regarding us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For His dealing with us, for His way in our life, and for breaking us in such a way, we should not only give thanks before Him, but also worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The clearest picture in the Bible of man worshipping God is seen in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he was dying, he worshipped God, leaning upon the top of his staff.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This staff, which he carried throughout his lifetime depicts on one hand the whole experience of his life, and on the other hand his life as a sojourner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We place more emphasis upon the aspect of his entire life's experience, because it includes his life of sojourning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when Jacob worshipped God by leaning on the top of his staff, it means that he worshipped God according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person has the experience of being led by God, he is then able to render worship before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if one has never had the experience of being dealt with by God, it is difficult for him to render worship before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the worship of man to God is based upon man's experience before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, after being disciplined before God, we need to have a very clear, sure, and solemn worship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this time, we are really accepting the discipline from God in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes it seems that we have accepted a discipline before God, yet we have neither confessed to Him thoroughly nor accepted the discipline and worshipped Him solemnly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that we have accepted the discipline, but we have not accepted it fully; therefore, that acceptance is not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Henceforth, when we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, may we first discover the purpose thereof, acknowledge our shortcomings and weaknesses, submit from within, and, finally, worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way our acceptance is very solid.</S>
