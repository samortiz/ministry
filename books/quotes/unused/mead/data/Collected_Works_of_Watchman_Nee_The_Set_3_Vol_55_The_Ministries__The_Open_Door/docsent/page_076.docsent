   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we appear before the Lord one day, I hope that all the young brothers will be together and will examine the calendar of 1930, 1935, or 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Granting that we will know all things as the Lord knows them, we will see that on January 1, 1930, the Lord had ordained an opportunity for us to go to North Szechuan Road to save twenty souls.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we did not go on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead we went to Nanyang Road and missed the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We lost twenty souls.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps we will examine January 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps that day the Lord wanted me to hold a gospel meeting at Pudong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps He wanted to gain five hundred people during those six months.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But on that day, I did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I missed an opportunity, and five hundred souls were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On January 3 perhaps the Lord gave me a thought that I should seek out a certain person who could have turned out to be a great vessel in the hand of the Lord in the next five years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps the Lord wanted to use such a person to save tens of thousands of souls, but on that day I did not go because I was afraid the weather was too hot, and I was too lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I lost an opportunity and neglected a person who was potentially very useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day by day, the Lord gives us countless opportunities in our life, and we miss them all!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why does the Bible translate time as opportunity?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because "opportunity" is something that is found in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every day the Lord gives us opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we can only bow our heads and say to the Lord, "I do not know what opportunities You have given me today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is never a day without Your arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every day You have ordained something to happen to me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those whom God can use never miss the opportunities He has provided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord may ordain that we should rent some place tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should rent that place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Or He may ordain that we help a certain person get over some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should do so accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we finish one matter, another will come our way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the second matter is finished, the third, and then the fourth will come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Things happen continually, and we do not know how great any one of them will be.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is like throwing a stone into the water; the circles keep expanding until the ripples touch the shore.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are faithful to follow up every event, we will not miss any opportunity, and we will reap colossal benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we miss any opportunity, the rippling may stop at any point, and our reluctance may result in no further widening of the circles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who would have guessed that one day an illiterate cobbler could become a Moody?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone had missed the opportunity to preach to him, the world would not have had a Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who would have guessed that Philip would meet the eunuch the day he went into the wilderness Acts 8:26-39 ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The entire church in Africa owes its beginning to that day, and we know that the church in Africa began earlier than the church in Europe!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not know how many opportunities we have missed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we wake up early in the morning, sometimes we feel as if all is light perhaps from the sunlight .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At other times we feel as if all is dark perhaps from considering our own future .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not know what will happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I beg you to discover every opportunity God has given you every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We hope we can discover the opportunities today instead of being reminded of them in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today is July 19, 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the Lord has put certain opportunities before me, and I can see them today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Redeeming the time means seeing what the Lord has arranged for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not miss the opportunities, the Lord will make tremendous gains, and the work will make immense progress.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to not miss the opportunities, we need spiritual training.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also need spiritual sensitivity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are spiritually sensitive, we will sense the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With spiritual training, we can identify opportunities when they come our way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot allow opportunities to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must not be dull to any direction from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must not let the Head have a sense that we are numb to His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to be desperate for this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should grasp whatever opportunity we have.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not have this kind of training and feeling, we will miss the opportunities the Lord has arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Day after day, we will become a person dull to opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One day we will face the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Perhaps we will regret the things in our life that now provide us with satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have come short of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have not been faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have acted foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord may have put ten opportunities before us, but we have not even touched one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Woe to us when we stand before the judgment seat!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not know how many opportunities we have missed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Woe to us, for we have acted thoughtlessly and have missed many opportunities that God has given us!</S>
