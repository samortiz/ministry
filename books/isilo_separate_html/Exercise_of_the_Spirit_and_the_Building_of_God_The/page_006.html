<p>The second step of God&rsquo;s plan for us to experience Him involves all that the Son has being realized in the Spirit. After I was saved and heard about being filled with the Holy Spirit and about the different works of the Holy Spirit within man, I longed to be filled with the Holy Spirit. In spite of my yearning, praying, and waiting, I did not feel the presence of the Holy Spirit. I asked myself what are the characteristics of the Holy Spirit, what kind of work does He do, and what would my condition be if He were in me?</p>
<p>Gradually, I found a key and touched a spiritual mystery. I realized that when the Holy Spirit was in me, I appreciated and loved the Lord Jesus. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be filled with feelings for the Lord Jesus. When I consider the Lord Jesus, I know that the Holy Spirit is in me.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said that those who believed into Him would receive the Spirit. We have believed into the Lord; hence, we have received the Spirit. The Bible does not tell us to believe in the Spirit, to worship the Spirit, or to pray to the Spirit. The Bible says that we should believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, worship Him, and pray to Him. Although we are not told to believe in the Spirit or pray to the Spirit, when we believe in the Lord, the Spirit enters into us, and when we bless or praise the Lord, the Spirit fills us. This is an amazing fact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SUBJECT<br />
AND CENTER OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Some saints said that they know the importance of prayer and the importance of serving with the human spirit. However, they do not know the subject of prayer. They know that they need to enter the Holy of Holies, touch the throne of grace, function as priests, serve with their spirit, release their spirit, exercise their spirit, be blended with other saints in spirit, and fellowship in spirit. These items are common knowledge among the saints. However, they do not know what words to use when they pray, and they do not have a subject.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the unique subject of our prayer. Ephesians 5:18-19 says that when the believers are filled with the Spirit in their spirit, they can use psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to sing and psalm with their hearts to the Lord. When believers are filled with the Spirit, Christ becomes the subject and the focus of their praise and prayer. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In other words, calling &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; is an indication that the Holy Spirit is working in a believer. Real prayer is centered on the Lord. When we exercise to pray, we do not need to ask for things; rather, we should praise the Lord, appreciate Him, behold Him, worship Him, and laud His virtues. This kind of prayer is real prayer.</p>
<p>A sister once said she had prayed and asked the Lord to improve her temper because her bad temper displeased her husband and made her children unhappy. She made up her mind to overcome her temper by the Lord&rsquo;s strength, but the more she prayed, the worse her temper became. She did not know what to do. When I asked her whether the Lord Jesus is lovely, she said, &ldquo;Of course, the Lord Jesus is lovely, but I have a bad temper, so I am not lovely.&rdquo; When I asked her whether she praised the Lord for His loveliness, she asked how someone with a temper as bad as hers could praise the Lord. This sister was focused on her temper, and the subject of her prayer was how to improve her temper. Regardless of how much I said concerning the Lord Jesus being so wonderful, she continued to ask how she could improve her temper. This sister could not forget her temper. I waited for a long time until she finished saying everything she had to say, and then I said, &ldquo;Sister, please do this one thing: From now on, do not pray concerning your temper. Instead, consider our lovely and glorious Lord, and praise Him. You can say, &lsquo;Lord, You are lovely; You are so glorious.&rsquo;&rdquo; I said that whenever she loses her temper, she should behold, praise, worship, and bless the Lord. The subject of her prayer should not be losing her temper; the Lord Jesus should be the subject of her prayer.</p>
<p>She came back a few days later and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your way works. When I worshipped, thanked, and praised the Lord, I forgot about my temper and was filled with the Lord Jesus. I began to rejoice. I stopped losing my temper when I encountered a troublesome situation; I felt at ease and was able to praise the Lord in a sweet way. I was full of joy.&rdquo; This sister touched a great spiritual secret. We should not allow anything to occupy our Christian life, that is, to become the subject of our living and prayer. The Christian life is a life with the Lord Jesus as its focus; the Lord Jesus should be the subject of a Christian&rsquo;s prayer.</p>
<p>A sister once said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, my only shortcoming is a lack of patience. I have asked the Lord to give me patience. Why has He not given it to me?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus does not give people patience. He only gives us Himself.&rdquo; Hence, we should not ask the Lord to give us patience. We should forget our impatience and instead consider the Lord, behold Him, praise Him, worship Him, and bless Him. We should tell Him how sweet it is to receive Him once more. If we pray in this way, we will be filled with Him, and we will be patient without trying, because the Lord will be our patience.</p>
<p>A brother once came to me for help. He had been trying to overcome a certain weakness but continually failed. He heard a servant of the Lord say that all our problems originate from our old man; we sin, lose our temper, and display other weaknesses because of our old man. However, our old man has been crucified with the Lord; He has delivered us from these problems. The brother was told that we only need to reckon ourselves as dead. This word made him happy, and he decided to practice reckoning himself as being dead. However, no matter how much he tried, his weakness remained and became even worse. He discovered that the more he reckoned himself as being dead, the more his old man was aroused and became even more active. Hence, he did not know what to do. I told him that a message on our co-crucifixion with Christ cannot deliver us, nor can our reckoning deliver us. Only the living Lord can save us. When He gains ground in us, He will spontaneously lead us to experience our co-crucifixion with Him in a practical way. We do not need to speak about co-crucifixion, nor do we need to reckon that we have died with Christ. We just need to let the living Lord be our subject and our center. It is sufficient for us to fellowship with Him daily and look to Him moment by moment by drawing near to Him and worshipping Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
