   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, we must help new believers to see that the kingdom of God is the enlargement of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Mark 4:26-29 the kingdom of God is a seed that is sown and grows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seed is Christ who is sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He grows in us and is enlarged in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The enlarged Christ is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This enlarged Christ becomes the sphere, the realm, of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1972 I released a series of messages concerning the kingdom of God in a conference in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These messages were later published in a book entitled The Kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Afterward, I released the Life-study of Mark and again stressed the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should read these messages when we speak concerning the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The kingdom of God is Christ as a seed sown into God s chosen people to grow and expand within them into a sphere, a realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the content of this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This enlarged Christ is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord Jesus is sown into us, He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He grows and expands in us, He is a realm, which is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are other verses in the New Testament concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, in Acts 14:22 Paul says that in order to enter into the kingdom of God we must go through many tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Revelation 1:9 John says, I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse indicates that the elderly John lived in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was not only in the house of God but also in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, Ephesians 2:19 says, You are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE CONSTITUENT AND CONTENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OF THE NEW MAN BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To Christ the church is the Body and the bride, and to God the church is His house and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body expresses Christ, whereas the bride satisfies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The house makes it possible for us to enjoy God and for God to enjoy us, whereas the kingdom is a realm established by God where Christ can be enlarged and can reign for the accomplishing of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In addition, Ephesians presents the church as the new man and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The new man is for the living that can fulfill God s will, and the warrior is for dealing with God s enemy and bringing in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church as the new man lives according to God s image in order to accomplish God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis 1 man was created according to God s image with the purpose of expressing God and representing God for the carrying out of His administration in order to accomplish God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter 3 the created man became fallen and corrupted to become the old man and therefore departed from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By chapter 11 man was divided and scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the situation of the old man when the Lord came.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After His incarnation, He died, resurrected, and entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As God s chosen ones, we are regenerated with a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, collectively we are the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The old man is the fallen created man who has not been regenerated with God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The new man is the redeemed old man who has been regenerated with God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is through the new man, who lives out God s image, that God s will can be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The life within the new man is God, and this life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ as the divine life is within us to be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As He becomes our content, there are no more distinctions or divisions among us, because on the cross Christ abolished all divisions, including the division between Jews and Gentiles Eph 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, there is no distinction among us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not achieved through the teaching of the law of ordinances but through Christ, who abolished the ordinances on the cross and has entered into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we live in His life, all distinctions are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is the constituent and the content of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the new man lives a life that is not only like God but even is God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life is the righteousness and holiness of the reality 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we live out this righteousness and holiness, we live out God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way we express God on earth and accomplish His will on earth for the fulfilling of His original purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a brief summary of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE CHURCH BEING THE WARRIOR</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The stress of the church as the warrior is on its armor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A warrior needs to put on armor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ephesians 6:10-18 speaks of the whole armor of God, and verses 14 through 18 show the various aspects of the whole armor of God: Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace; besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith...And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this portion of the Scripture there are six items of the armor of God that need to be put on, and every item is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first item is the girdle of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Truth is Christ, the reality John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The second item is the breastplate of righteousness, and righteousness is Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Satan attacks us and accuses us, we should say, Christ is my righteousness; His precious blood cleanses me from all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The third item is the firm foundation of peace; this peace is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Ephesians 2:14 says, He Himself is our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fourth item is the shield of faith, which is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The fifth item is the helmet of salvation, and salvation is Christ Luke 2:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God s salvation covers our mind against the negative thoughts that the evil one injects into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily lives John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The sixth item is the sword of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Both the Spirit and the word are Christ 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church as the warrior needs the whole armor of God, and the element and essence of the various items of the armor are Christ as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To put on the armor is to put on Christ, that is, to apply what Christ is in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Ephesians 6:18 there is an additional point prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Prayer is the means through which we apply the various items of the armor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we want to put on Christ as our armor, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In leading new believers to know the church, we need to help them see that the church is the Body of Christ and His bride, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the new man, and the warrior.</S>
