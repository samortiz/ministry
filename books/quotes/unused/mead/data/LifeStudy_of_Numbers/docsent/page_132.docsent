   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and Balaam Prophesying in a Parable</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam's burnt offering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a parable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4-5, 7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The situation here was quite strange.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The offerings were not offered to Jehovah; rather, in an ambiguous way, they were offered to Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, for the sake of His people Israel, God ruled over Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No doubt, Balaam had the desire and the intention in his heart to curse Israel that he might please Balak and receive more money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But as the One who was watching and ruling, the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word in verses 7 through 10 was surely inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The human mind is not able to compose such a parable, a parable which Balaam spoke as a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is strong evidence that the Bible was inspired by the living, almighty, and speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us now look into certain aspects of Balaam's first parable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Balak had said to Balaam, "Come, curse Jacob for me,/And come, denounce Israel" v. 7b . However, this was impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Balaam said, "How can I curse him whom God has not cursed?/How can I denounce him whom Jehovah has not denounced?/For from the top of the rocks I see him,/From the hills I behold him./Behold, a people that will dwell alone,/And will not reckon themselves among the nations!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word about the children of Israel's dwelling alone and not reckoning themselves among the nations indicates that they were a holy, sanctified people, a people set apart from the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 10 Balaam went on to say, "Who can count the dust of Jacob,/Or number the fourth part of Israel?/Let me die the death of the upright,/And let my end be like theirs!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see the blessing of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob, like the dust, will be numberless, countless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one will be able to count even the fourth part of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the word concerning the death of the upright is a word of great blessing and appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first parable was a blessing upon the children of Israel as a separate people, a particular and special class of people who dwell alone and who are not reckoned among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because this people will be blessed with abundant increase, no one will be able to number them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After uttering this great blessing, Balaam expressed his appreciation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Balak Complaining to Balaam</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That He Had Blessed Israel instead of Cursing Them</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Balaam's word of blessing and appreciation concerning Israel offended Balak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the reason Balak said to him, "What have you done to me?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I took you to curse my enemies, and you have altogether blessed them!" v. 11 . To this Balaam replied, "Must I not take heed to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?" v. 12 .</S>
