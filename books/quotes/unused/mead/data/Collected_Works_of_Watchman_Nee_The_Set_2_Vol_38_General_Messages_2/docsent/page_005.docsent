   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN WORKING TOGETHER WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Does this mean that man has no place in the work of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did Paul say, "For we are God's fellow workers" 1 Cor 3:9 ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He asked the Corinthian believers, "Are you not my work in the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must consider the way Paul became a fellow worker of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 3 shows us that God is the Lord of the work and that all the workers are under His direction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul told us in Galatians that the word he preached was according to revelation because it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through revelation, Paul received genuine spiritual knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, he did not confer with flesh and blood; instead, he preached the Christ whom he knew through revelation to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was able to work because he first allowed God to work in him; he allowed God to work Himself into him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First God revealed His Son through the Spirit in Paul; he came to know Christ according to spiritual reality and not according to flesh 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Paul was able to preach this Christ he had received to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul did not preach an objective Christ; he did not preach an intangible Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He preached a Christ whom he had experienced personally.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was as real in him as his very self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ was in him, and he was in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ was in his thoughts, his words, and his actions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ was the Lord within Paul, and Paul was Christ's outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may say that he was Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may also say that Christ was seen in him and that he was Christ, for indeed he was taken possession of by Christ Phil 3:12, Darby's New Translation .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul's preaching was based on what he had.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The measure of Christ that he knew became the measure of Christ he preached to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, being a fellow worker of God does not mean that we should work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, it means that we should first allow God to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only then can we tell others about the Christ we know through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The work is still the Lord's; man is only there to report His work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul asked the Corinthian saints, "Are you not my work in the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 Cor 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their being in the Lord was the result of Paul's preaching the Christ he knew to them and of their receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What was the message Paul preached among the Corinthians?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the central message which he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the negative side, there is the removing of the old creation from the believers through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the positive side, there is the constitution of Christ into the believers through revelation for the building up of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What Paul preached is the same as what the Holy Spirit is revealing in the believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as the Holy Spirit revealed the knowledge of Christ and His crucifixion to Paul, so also the Holy Spirit is revealing the knowledge of Christ and His crucifixion to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We repeat that the work is the Lord's; man is here only to speak of His work within man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why Paul said that the foundation of the work is Jesus Christ and that no one else can lay another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also said that we are God's cultivated land and His building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the seed sown in the cultivated land is Christ, the harvest must also be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the foundation of the building is Christ, the building itself must also be according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the time of our regeneration, God put the life of Christ into us, and we received a life which we did not have before.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The life which we received at the time of regeneration is an additional life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is something added to us at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's work in man is absolutely based on this added life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life is Christ Col 3:4 , and it is the foundation of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Just as the regenerated life is absolutely of God, the growth and maturity of this life can only be brought about by God 2 Cor 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man's hand has no part in this, and even the best of what man has cannot participate in this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The greatest responsibility that man has is to cooperate with God and not afford any hindrance to His work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sanctification is merely the continuation of this life, and victory is merely the outflow of this life in overcoming sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The growth and maturity of this life are simply the reigning and ruling of this life over the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The life we received at the time of regeneration is the beginning of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the continuation of this work cannot be affected by anything other than this life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, especially those who are called to the Lord's work, we have to be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we really want to be fellow workers of God, our work must be this pure.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to deny the best that we have in fear and trembling so that God's work will not suffer any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must remember that without the revelation of the Holy Spirit, without seeing and experiencing something in the reality of the spirit, we cannot do God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only a regenerated person can testify of the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who do not have the experience of regeneration cannot do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Victory, sanctification, the filling of the Spirit, and the reigning of the indwelling Christ can only be testified by those who by grace have passed through these experiences in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even while they are testifying, they must still trust in the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without the working of the Spirit, there will not be any anointing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Dependence is an absolute necessity in spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Unless the Spirit of the Lord works, no work of man will accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Please remember that God's work is first God working in us and then God working out of us through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only such a work will build the church.</S>
