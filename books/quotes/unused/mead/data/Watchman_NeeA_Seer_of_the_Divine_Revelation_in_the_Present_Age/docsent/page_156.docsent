   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELATIONSHIP IN ENTERING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While in Shanghai in October 1933, Watchman received me as his guest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I stayed with him for about four months, and during that time he did a number of things to perfect me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning some of these things, I was clear what he was doing, and concerning others I was not clear at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I spent much time with him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were together for many hours, and I always gave him the opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would not speak, for I realized that the more I spoke, the more foolish I was.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I gave all the time to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He never talked with me about vain things but always took the opportunity to speak with me mainly about four matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, he helped me know the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before I stayed with him, I loved the Lord and had already obtained a great deal of doctrinal knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I was not clear concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was not until I spent time with him that my eyes were opened to see the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One afternoon as we sat together, neither of us said a word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was seated on a sofa and he in a rocking chair.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While he was rocking, he began to ask me, "Brother Witness, what is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The question was too simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Surely we all know what patience is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But since this question came from his mouth, it had to be of considerable import.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I dared not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While he was rocking, he continued, "What is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not understand what his intention with me was at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had a burden, but I did not comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually I said, "Well, patience to me is a sort of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When people ill-treat you and persecute you, yet you endure the suffering, that is patience."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He shook his head and said, "No!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I said, "Please tell me, what is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He answered, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I could not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It sounded like a foreign language to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I asked, "Brother, what do you mean by saying that patience is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Would you explain it to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He only continued rocking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He offered not a word of explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Patience is Christ," he repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was not only puzzled but deeply bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We remained in that state for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I would not raise any other question, and he would say nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was very eager to know what he meant, but after a long period with no explanation forthcoming, I was fully disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was late in the afternoon, and eventually I said, "Brother Nee, the time is gone; I must return to have my dinner."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He replied, "All right."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I returned to the guest house, I was really troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I went to my room and prayed, "Lord, what does it mean that patience is Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord spoke to me in those days, and my eyes were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I saw that Christ Himself is my patience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Real patience is not a kind of behavior, but just Christ lived out from me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I saw it!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was in this way that Watchman helped me so greatly in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second, during these times of fellowship Watchman also related to me the history of the Lord's move with him from the year he was saved up to that day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was not fully in the church, nor was I in the work in those first ten years of the Lord's recovery; so he used hour after hour to convey the things to me concerning the Lord's move in those years, not in a brief way but in full detail.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the time I did not understand his reason for relating those things to me, but later I knew.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He purposed to perfect me and build me up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was laying a good foundation.</S>
