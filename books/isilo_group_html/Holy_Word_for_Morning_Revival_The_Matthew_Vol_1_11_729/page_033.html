If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged with righteousness by the Lord; if they judge others with mercy, they will be judged with mercy by the Lord. Mercy triumphs over judgment (James 2:13).</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> As the kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we must consider the beam in our own eye whenever we look at the splinter in our brother&#8217;s eye. The splinter in our brother&#8217;s eye must remind us of the beam in our own eye.</p><p>5<sup>1</sup> As long as the beam remains in our eye, our vision is blurred and we cannot see clearly.</p><p>6<sup>1</sup> That which is holy must refer to the objective truth, which belongs to God; your pearls must refer to the subjective experiences, which are ours.</p><p>6<sup>2</sup> Dogs do not have hoofs, nor do they chew the cud; hogs have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud. Thus, both are unclean (Lev. 11:27, 7). According to the revelation in 2 Pet. 2:12, 19-22, and Phil. 3:2, dogs and hogs here refer to people who are religious but not clean.</p><p>7<sup>1</sup> First ask, then seek, and last knock. To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> In the parallel verse, Luke 11:13, it is the Holy Spirit instead of good things, because Luke emphasizes the blessing of the gospel, the center of which is the Spirit (Gal. 3:8, 14). Since Matthew stresses the kingdom of the heavens, good things should refer to the blessings of the reality of the kingdom, as revealed in chs. 5-7, blessings to be given as gifts to the kingdom people.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Apparently, the Lord&#8217;s intention in 7:1-12 is to cover the principles according to which the kingdom people deal with others. Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others.</p><p>If you take care of others, you will not judge them, criticize them, or measure them....Do not try to determine how spiritual others are, how much growth they have, or what is their condition in life. If you refrain from measuring others, you will be kept from criticizing them and judging them....Mercy does not do any measuring....Mercy is absolutely blind....In helping others, we must be blind....We must consider them, sympathize with them, and be merciful toward them.
