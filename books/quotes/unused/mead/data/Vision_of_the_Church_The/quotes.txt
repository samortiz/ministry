[1]  If we would be a proper Christian, we all need one day to see the vision of the church.
[2]  The vision of the church is more neglected by Christians than that of Christ.
[3]  Thirdly, we must see that the practical expression of the church must be local.
[4]  If we would put the church into practice, if we would make it practical, we must have a local expression.
[5]  But we do have the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church in Antioch Acts 13:1 , the church at Cenchrea Rom 16:1 , the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , and the church in so many other cities.
[6]  We could not have the home churches or the street churches; we could only have the city church.
[7]  If you get into anything other than the local church of the city, you get into a division; if you get into the church of that city, you get into unity.
