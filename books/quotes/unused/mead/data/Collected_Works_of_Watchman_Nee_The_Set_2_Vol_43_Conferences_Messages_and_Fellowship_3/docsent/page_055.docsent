   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONFERENCE IN PENANG, APRIL 1938 CHAPTER EIGHTY GOD IS LIGHT Date: April 1, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Penang</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:5-7</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First John 1:5-7 shows us two things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, God is light, and second, God dwells in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If God were not light, man would not know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, because God dwells in the light, man can see God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>More accurately, God re-created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We see life on the third day, but there was light on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We first find light and then life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that light is more important than life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In God's work He commanded light to appear, and then the rest followed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WHAT IS LIGHT?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the meaning of light?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Old Testament does not tell us what light is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the New Testament, Ephesians 5:13 speaks of light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the only instance in the entire Bible that speaks of the function of light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why I treasure this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Light is that which makes manifest the hidden things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for a person to search for light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once he comes into the light, he is enlightened by it, and the light searches him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Light functions by making the hidden things manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Light is that which exposes the hidden things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being enlightened is having the hidden things exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a man is under the light, it is not strange for him to realize his sins; rather, it is strange for him to sin and remain oblivious to it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you are a regenerated person, God will surely speak to you and shine on you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will not do anything that is contrary to human decency or the biblical standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God shines His light on those who are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we must obey and take heed to God's commands, the enlightening of the Spirit, and the inner leading of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD IS LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who boast that they are right are surely not in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1904 and 1905 the greatest known revival in church history occurred in Wales, England.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Evan Roberts was instrumental in bringing in this revival.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He once asked his congregation when was the last time they confessed their sins to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some said that it had been over five years, while others said that it had been over ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then he told them that those who had not recently confessed were fallen, while those who had made a recent confession were living in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time Mr. Roberts was only twenty-eight years old, and some despised him for his age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The problem does not lie in our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The problem lies in the fact that when we make mistakes, we do not recognize them as mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves that we lack God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The starting point of the Christian life is the enlightening of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we draw near to God, the more we will see light, and the more we will be humbled and conscious of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For a Christian, the first step toward growth in the spiritual life is to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a person sees God, he sees himself at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one who lives in the presence of the Lord is self-assured.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more a person sees light, the more he lives in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul's attitude was always one of fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This should be the attitude of every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A Christian should not trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only those who confess their sins are living in God's light; they are the ones who are not walking in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Darkness means the ignorance of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are in darkness are oblivious to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more a person sees light, the more he knows sin, and the more sensitive his feelings are toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is light, and He dwells in the light 1 John 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as a man comes into the light, the light exposes all that he is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is light, and light enables us to know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>GOD IS IN THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What does it mean for God to be in the light?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Old Testament age God dwelt in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There was no natural or man-made light in the Holy of Holies; God was obscure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was a riddle and a mystery to man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Man could only make conjectures about Him; he could not fathom who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the New Testament age God manifested Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that God has become a revealed God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although He was a God who hid Himself, He reveals Himself and manifests Himself through the light of the gospel 2 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now we know the kind of God He is, and we know the great things that He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man is able to know himself because God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Man is able to know God because God dwells in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First, God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Second, God manifests Himself in the light of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>First John 1:7 says, "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light..."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once we receive God through the revelation of the light of the gospel, we no longer walk according to the law but according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Light in the Bible is related to the light of holiness and the light of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The light in 1 John 1 is the light of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We know God through the light of the gospel, and we walk in this light.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As a result, "the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God is light, and this light exposes the true condition of man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God is in the light, and this light reveals Him as the God who is full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although our sins may be serious, we can come to Him boldly and allow the blood of Jesus His Son to cleanse us from all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May the Lord show us these two different functions of light.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Light enables us to see God and to receive Him as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Light also enables us to see ourselves and points out the need for the blood of the Lord, which washes away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It also points out our need to walk in God's light.</S>
