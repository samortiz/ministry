<li>The end man deserves
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The end man deserves is death.</li>

	<li>Since man lives in sin, his end shall be death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus tasted death for man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s death has its source in his sin. When Jesus tasted death for man, He bore man&rsquo;s sin.</li>
	<li>That Jesus bore man&rsquo;s sin meant that He received the punishment for sin. That punishment was death.</li>
	<li>Describe how Jesus tasted death for man, how He was forsaken by God, and how His heart melted like wax. He suffered the burning of the fire of God&rsquo;s wrath. These experiences are tastes of death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The results of Jesus tasting death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s sins were forgiven.</li>
	<li>Man has been freed from the suffering of death.</li>
	<li>Those who believe in Him do not perish and will be resurrected if they die.</li>
	</ol></li>
