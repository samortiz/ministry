   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRODUCING OF FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should endeavor to have one out of twenty saints in our locality serve the Lord with all of their time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this way nineteen saints can support one full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The saints need to be helped by us to give for the sake of supporting full-timers for the Lord's move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need the full-timers for the spread of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the Lord had five thousand full-timers in His recovery today, the result would be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The United States is a strong country because it has a strong military.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The full-time trainees should be trained to be such a strong army for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have the burden to train the full-timers in the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every full-time trainee must become very knowledgeable of the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We want them to dive into the Recovery Version of the New Testament with the notes on the text and into the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They must have a proper knowledge of the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then when they go out, they will have something to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also have the burden to help the trainees to grow absolutely in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, they have to be built up in their character.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They need to be trained to dress properly and to give people a good impression of their appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have a good appearance, who will listen to us or respect us?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must adjust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a co-worker teaches the truth without a necktie, the people's confidence in him will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way we dress, cut our hair, and comb our hair will give us a proper appearance which can help gain people's regard and respect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past we were too loose and self-contented.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who work for the Lord should dress in a way that is fitting in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The trainees also need to be trained in how to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They need to learn how to present the truths as they have been expounded among us in the Recovery Version and in the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need to invent new messages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can present the messages which we have already published.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to present the better things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have the groceries of the truth among us, so there is no need to try to get new groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we all would be absolute to take the God-ordained way, and if we can produce one out of twenty full-timers in all the churches, the Lord's recovery will increase and spread in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The old way should be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our way in the past was too loose and too sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have been self-contented.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be desperate to take the Lord's ordained way for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our preaching of the gospel, we should abandon the system of having large gospel meetings with one speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we should invest our prayer, time, and energy to go out to visit people in our community and on our campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The full-timers especially need to spend their time to visit people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This should also be a priority with all of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the burden in the full-time training to train the young people not only to preach the gospel but also to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to learn how to convince people with the higher truths.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, the teaching of the truths which the Lord has committed to us is included in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many wonderful truths have been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The world is starving for these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why those who are full-timers must become very knowledgeable of the truths and must accumulate the experience in life.</S>
