What we will consider here will be helpful not only to those who teach in our summer school but to all those who speak for the Lord
The word teaching is found in 2 Timothy 3:16, where we are told that 'all Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching'
Paul alluded to some kind of school when he told us that he was 'trained at the feet of Gamaliel' , a teacher of the law
The reason we need to receive the word of God by prayer is that, according to 2 Timothy 3:16, the Scriptures are God-breathed
God has breathed Himself out in the Scriptures, and thus our reading of the Scriptures should be our receiving of God's breath
Those who serve in the Summer School of Truth should not serve according to their natural ability or professional training
Once we have a clear understanding of the nature of our summer school, we will know what to do and how to do it
The nature of the Summer School of Truth is a matter of ministering, of serving, the Triune God to the young people
Our goal is to bring the young people not to the lesson books but to bring them to the Triune God through the lesson books
Your aim is not to teach the lesson book but to bring the young people to God through the channel of the lesson book
Through your teaching, your serving, in the Summer School of Truth, everyone in your class should be brought to God
To say that all Scripture is God-breathed is to say that the Bible is the breath, the breathing out, of the very God who is Spirit
On our side the Bible is for us to receive profit in four matters-teaching, conviction or reproof, correction, and instruction
If we have the proper and adequate spiritual experience, we will realize that in verse 16 teaching equals revelation
As you are teaching the young people, you should be taking away a veil so that they may see something of the Triune God
When you are serving in the Summer School of Truth, you should not allow the veil to remain over the eyes of the young people
Now we can see that for the Bible to be profitable for teaching means that it is profitable for unveiling, for rolling away the veil
Often in our reading of the Scriptures, we read without receiving any revelation, and thus there is no reproof
Correction is a matter of setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, and restoring to an upright state
We may be wrong in the way we spend our money, in the way we spend our time, in the way we dress, or in the way we style our hair
Because we may be wrong in so many different things, we are rebuked by the revelation we receive when we read the Scriptures
When we are rebuked in this way, we are spontaneously corrected, and when we are corrected we have the instruction in righteousness
A few days later he may be wrong with her again, and once again he will need to be rebuked, corrected, and adjusted
A man of God is a God-man one who partakes of Gods life and nature thus being one with God in His life and nature and thereby expressing Him
The issue of teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness is that the man of God becomes complete
In the Summer School of Truth you should present a teaching that is an unveiling, the rolling away of the veil
When we read the Bible, we should receive life; and when we teach others concerning the Bible, they should receive life
In our reading of the Bible, there may be no spirit; and in our teaching of the Bible to others, there also may be no spirit
If we do not sense the Spirit as we are reading the Bible, we should realize that something is wrong, and then we should adjust ourselves
From experience we know that in order for there to be much spirit in our reading and teaching of the Bible, we need much prayer
We must be a person who is continually breathing the Lord, a person who is always inhaling God
Our reading of the Bible should be a kind of inhaling, and our teaching of the Bible should be a kind of exhaling
When you breathe the Spirit you receive not only unveiling, rebuking, correcting, and instructing - you receive life
Having become a praying person, a person who inhales God, go back to your class and exhale what you have received of God
In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
We all need to be living persons, those who are living channels with the words of God proceeding out through us
If you are such a living channel, then the students in your class will receive spiritual food for their nourishment
They may be rebuked, corrected, and instructed by what the Bible says concerning honor, love, humility, and honesty
If we would take the word of the Bible as a sword for fighting the enemy, we must touch the Bible in a way that is full of the Spirit
If we would use the word of the Bible as a sword to kill the enemy, in our experience the word must be the Spirit
Eph 6:12 reveals that our enemies are the evil spirits, the world rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies
The evil power in the air comes in to take advantage of her emotion, and she determines not to forget that she has been offended
Apparently the sword of the Spirit kills my emotion; actually it kills the evil spirit in the air who takes advantage of my emotion
Without the word as the Spirit to be the killing sword, there would be no way for us to be kept in the church life over the years
The word that we receive in a living way as the Spirit is a spiritual antibiotic that kills the 'germs' within us
As long as in our experience the word becomes the Spirit, the word will not only heal us but also kill the enemy
In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells us that God 'desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth'
In our summer school, we should endeavor to bring the young people into the experiential knowledge of the reality of the Triune God
During the centuries following the completion of the Bible, there have been many teachings which have not been on God's economy
There are many other matters in the Bible, such as the history and the prophecies, which can become distractions to us
As you teach in the Summer School of Truth, you should not have any burden, any view, or any vision other than God's economy
Only when you are clear concerning this basic matter will you know what we intend to do in the Summer School of Truth
We have pointed out that in 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charged Timothy to commit to faithful men the things which he had heard from Paul
At this juncture we need to ask a question: What was the gift of God that Timothy was charged to fan into flame?
Concerning this matter of fanning into flame the gift of God, we may still be under the influence of traditional Christian teaching
The 'fire' of the Spirit is in us as the 'stove,' but in order for the fire to burn, there is the need of a 'draft'
The first step in fanning the gift is not to exercise; the first step is to open all the 'doors' and 'windows'
In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul told Timothy to 'pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
We have emphasized the fact that to have a flame you need to let the draft come in through opening up to the Lord
If you pray by yourself, you may keep thinking about the situation with your spouse and thus have no way to fan the flame
All those who speak for the Lord know that it is easy to speak in a meeting where there is an atmosphere of prayer
To teach in our summer school, you must be a person of prayer, a person with a flame who brings in an atmosphere of prayer
Once you have fanned the gift of God into flame stirred up the praying spirit and created an atmosphere of prayer you are now ready to teach
You should not ask your students merely to remember and recite all the points related to man's fallen condition
If you would teach in an experiential way, you should help the young people to realize that they themselves are fallen
You may ask them to paint a picture of their own fallen condition, not just to remember a number of doctrinal points
If you would teach in an experiential way you must help your students to realize that they have sinned by disobeying particular commandments
By speaking to them in this way, you will help them to realize experientially what it means to be under God's judgment
As you are teaching the young people in your class, you should frequently talk to them in a personal and practical way
As you are talking with them, you should be watchful over each one, paying particular attention to their expressions
In order to carry out this burden, you need to put into practice all the points we have covered in this message
The books of 1 and 2 Timothy were written to deal with the church's decline and to inoculate the believers against this decline
Because of the influence of this decline, we need to train our young people with everything that Paul taught Timothy
In 1 Timothy the decline crept in subtly through different teachings and in 2 Timothy it developed openly and even worsened through heresies
The structure of the divine truth is nothing less than the Triune God plus His redemption, which becomes our salvation
On the one hand, we may speak of the structure of the truth; on the other hand, we may speak of the element of the inoculation
As you prepare yourself to teach, you should not merely put your trust in the lesson book nor in the compendium
All of the class time, which is actually quite limited, should be used for presenting the truth of God's economy
Let us consider the practical matter of teaching in an experiential way rather than in a doctrinal way
In order to teach in an experiential way, you must convert every point in the lesson from doctrine into experience
We must not damage the young people by giving them mere knowledge. To profit them with the truth we must teach them in an experiential way
By speaking in this way, we will 'hit two birds with one stone'-the 'bird' of experience and the 'bird' of doctrine
In the ministry in the Lord's recovery, we present our teachings not in the way of doctrine but in the way of life
Eventually one does learn some doctrine, but it is experiential doctrine, doctrine that is learned through experience
You may realize that you do not know how to convert doctrine into experience, because you are lacking in experience
You may conclude that your experience is not even adequate for a testimony, much less for teaching a class of young people
Pray 'Lord, have mercy upon me. I need some experience of this matter.' This is the way to prepare yourself to teach every lesson.
Come together with several others and check every point of every lesson according to experience.
Practice converting the doctrinal points into experience.
If you do this, the summer school will be a great benefit not only to the young people but to the entire church
