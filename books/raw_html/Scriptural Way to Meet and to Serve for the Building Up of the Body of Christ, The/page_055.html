 <h2 class="head1">THE LIVING WORD, THE EMBODIMENT OF THE SPIRIT,<br />
BEING IN OUR MOUTH AND IN OUR HEART</h2>
<p>The living word, the embodiment of the Spirit, is in our mouth and in our heart according to Romans 10:8. How can the word be in our mouth and even in our heart? It is by being the embodiment of the Spirit. We must always remember that today the living word we speak is the embodiment of the Spirit. This word is Christ, and this word is the Spirit, the processed Triune God. My speaking is a major factor of my good health. My speaking requires a lot of deep breathing. Deep breathing is a very healthy practice for our physical being. In like manner, when we exercise to speak the living word, this is very healthy to our spiritual being, to our spirit. The more we speak the living word in a living way, the more we exercise our spirit and the more we breathe the fresh air of the Spirit. Then our spiritual being, which is actually our intrinsic being, our spirit, becomes very, very healthy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
WITH A SPIRIT-FILLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we desire to speak the word of God, we must first have our spirit filled with the Spirit (Eph. 5:18-19). This means that we have to pray. We have to make a thorough confession of our sins to get ourselves fully emptied. Then our spirit will be filled with the Spirit, and we will speak by our Spirit-filled spirit. When our spirit is filled with the Spirit, we are qualified to speak. We all have to practice being filled with the Spirit to speak by our Spirit-filled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO SPEAK<br />
THE WORD OF CHRIST TO ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:16 indicates that we need to exercise to speak the word of Christ to one another. It is very good for the members of a family to speak the word of Christ to one another. We have to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord. This will enable us to render some help to the meetings. If speaking the word becomes our habit, we will speak in the meetings and the meetings will be greatly enriched. Presently for many of us, our habit is not to speak. To change our habit is not so easy. We need to build up the habit of speaking the word of the Lord until it becomes easy for us to speak.</p>
<p>A person cannot live without talking. The more we talk, the healthier we will be. Talking makes people healthy and happy. To keep ourselves quiet all the time is to choke ourselves, and to talk is to release ourselves. I am not encouraging you to talk in a profane and vain way (1 Tim. 6:20) but to talk with the living word of the Lord. Then your entire spiritual being will be released. The more release you enjoy, the more growth you will have. You will grow by speaking the living word, which is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and you will enjoy what you speak.</p>
