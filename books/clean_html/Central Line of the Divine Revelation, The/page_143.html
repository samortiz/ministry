<P>In John 11 Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. To be resurrected from the dead is to receive the divine dispensing. In John 12:24 Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." If the Lord had not fallen into the earth and died, He would have been one grain alone. By falling into the earth and dying, He sprouted in His resurrection, and the one grain became many grains. This is the dispensing of the life within the one grain into many grains.</P><P>We can never exhaust the significance of John 14&#151;16. The first part of chapter fourteen tells us that Christ is the embodiment of God the Father to express Him (vv. 7-11). Verses 16-20 tell us that the Spirit is the reality of Christ to make Him real to us, and that all those who believe in Him will receive the Spirit. When we receive the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. In this way we have the Divine Trinity within us dispensing Himself to us continually.</P><P>In chapter fifteen there is a vine tree with many branches. Every day and every moment the vine tree dispenses its rich life juice into the branches. In chapter sixteen the Lord likened His coming resurrection to the birth of a child (vv. 16-24). Resurrection is a real dispensing of the Divine Trinity into God's chosen people.</P><P>In John 17 Jesus prayed to the Father, saying, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me" (v. 21). The oneness for which the Lord prayed here is a coinherence, that is, a mutual dwelling of the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the believers in one another. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Father, and all the believers are in the Father and the Son. In this way the believers share the oneness of the Divine Trinity. This kind of sharing indicates the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. He is dispensing, and we receive and enjoy the oneness that is in and among the Divine Trinity. Now, in addition to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we become the fourth party in this oneness. Whether or not we can explain this, it is a fact that the oneness revealed in John 17 is a oneness of four parties. To include the fourth party in this oneness was not easy. The Lord accomplished many things to get into us and bring us into the Triune God, to make us one with the Triune God. This is all due to the divine dispensing.</P><P>In John 18 the Lord was arrested, and in John 19 He was crucified. Through His crucifixion, blood and water came out of His side (19:34). The blood is for redemption, and the water is for the imparting of life. This imparting of life is the divine dispensing.</P>
