Creation is wonderful, and redemption is even more wonderful, but neither of these two wonderful things is God's goal
We came from God's creation, we were redeemed, and now we are going on under His redemption toward the goal of building
In the Old Testament and even more in the New Testament we can see this precious, great matter of God's redemption
In the first book of the New Testament, one day the Lord Jesus suddenly revealed the matter of building to His disciples
The disciples told Him, 'Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets'
Jesus said, 'Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens
It seems that the Lord was saying Peter you received the revelation concerning Christ but you also need to see that Christ is for something
Today He is on the way, which began from His creation, passes through His redemption, and eventually will reach His building
They teach that as a holy people, the sisters should have skirts of a certain length and hair of a certain length
We also need to drop the layer of spirituality the layer of holiness the layer of the second blessing and even the layer of being scriptural
It says that Witness Lee is not scriptural because he tells people that the Son is the Father and that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit
The book says that the Son and the Father cannot be one because the Father spoke to the Son and because the Son prayed to the Father
He is truly frightened if he sees that we are being built together, for he realizes that he cannot prevail against the builded church
If we seek spirituality every day, Satan will be happy, for under his scheme we will be kept from God's building
His being scriptural may motivate him to fight against other believers who disagree with his understanding of the time of rapture
After meeting together for a period of time, some in the group may be influenced to have a different understanding of the rapture
As long as others hold a different concept, a believer who seeks to be scriptural may have nothing to do with them
Eventually, he may have nothing to do with any other Christian because he will feel that he is the only one who is truly scriptural
When any two believers have differing interpretations of the Bible, each will feel that he or she is being scriptural and the other is not
When we began to have the Lord's table, there were eleven brothers, and these eleven brothers held many different concepts
If someone had stirred up our minds with our different concepts, we eleven brothers would have immediately begun to fight
They thought that sprinkling was a more convenient way and that immersing people was too difficult for the sick and the elderly
The proper church life does not depend on any kind of concept or teaching; it is simply in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ
Since the Lord's recovery came to the United States, many Christian groups have risen up to oppose the recovery
The Lord's recovery is being attacked from every side, but it is also prevailing on every side because the truth is with the recovery
Rather, we are here for the genuine oneness on the unique ground of oneness so that the Lord can build us all together
Before the children of Israel crossed the river Jordan the Lord showed Moses the good land and then Moses died according to the Lords word
They could worship God privately anywhere, but they had no right to choose the place to come together to worship God corporately
God would choose the unique place among the twelve tribes where He would cause His name to dwell and where He would set up His habitation
They had no right to offer their burnt offerings their vows their firstfruits or any of the things that belonged to God in any other place
They were all required to go to the one unique place chosen by God where God's name and His habitation were established
The unique ground chosen by God in the Old Testament for His people to gather to worship Him is a physical type
For years it was difficult for us to see this, but by the Lord's mercy and through much experience, we have seen what today's Jerusalem is
In their conversation she was exposed for having had five husbands and for living with a man who was not her husband
When her sinfulness was exposed, she turned the subject of conversation from her husbands to the worship of God
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
We can be one only in our human spirit because today our spirit is the place chosen by God for all of us to worship Him
We should not gather together because we all shout in the meetings, because we all pray-read, or because we all call on the name of the Lord
If a silent brother comes to his spirit and stays in his spirit for two weeks, he will become the loudest one, shouting, 'Praise the Lord!
When we are in our spirit, we do not need to try to keep the oneness of the Spirit; rather, we spontaneously have the oneness of the Spirit
Rather, the Bible is a book of revelation, revealing to us that the God of purpose is living, moving, and working
Genesis 2 shows the purpose for which God created man-that man might take God in as life to become precious materials for God's building
By saying this, she too was blaming God by implying that God should have crushed the serpent before he had a chance to seduce her
You only opened the door and paved the way for Me to come in and bring forth the seed of the woman, who will crush your head'
Rather, He said that He would put enmity between the serpent and the woman and that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head
After hearing the first preaching of the gospel, Adam's feeling changed, and he called his wife Eve, which means 'living'
Genesis 3 presents a wonderful picture of the seed of the woman who would come to bruise the head of the serpent
Without the serpent coming in to seduce man, causing him to fall, there might have been no way for the seed of the woman to be revealed
Without the serpent and the fall of man, the Lord Jesus could never have been revealed as the seed of the woman
Christ's bruising of the serpent's head not only took place on the cross objectively but also is being accomplished in us subjectively
To be living, to please God, to call on His name, and to walk with Him are godly ways, but they are not adequate to fulfill God's purpose
When Noah received the vision to build the ark, he probably told others, 'God's purpose today is to build the ark
In principle, what we hear today regarding our practice of the proper church life to fulfill of God's purpose is the same
In Matthew 24:37 and Luke 17:26 the Lord Jesus likened the situation of the present generation to that in the days of Noah
Today people are busy working so that they can eat better food, drive better cars, own bigger homes, and find better marriages
If their marriage does not satisfy them, they feel that they can divorce their spouse and go on to another marriage
Lee, if you will forget about the testimony of the local church, all the churches in our city will invite you to speak
Each Sunday a different church will invite you to give a message, and all our members will come to listen to you
God is waiting for a group of people to terminate this age and usher in the coming kingdom age by being faithful to His revelation
The purpose of every meeting, conference, and training is to minister the all-inclusive, unsearchable riches of Christ into the saints
There is no Westerner, no Easterner, no British, no German, no French, no American, no Chinese, and no Japanese
Christ is rich in mercy, grace, love, joy, peace, humility, kindness, light, power, spirituality, and holiness
For our past He was made our righteousness, for our present He was made our sanctification, and for our future He was made our redemption
We should all declare, 'The seed of the woman, who bruised the head of the serpent, is now the life-giving Spirit in me'
Some who oppose the truth that Christ is the Spirit say, 'Christ is in heaven, and He is in us through the Holy Spirit'
We all need to say, 'We are no good at all for the church, but we have One in us who is not only good for the church but who is the church'
When these men were newborn babies, they each weighed only about seven and a half pounds and were only about twenty inches long
Our physical body is simply the composition of all the riches of the food that we have eaten, digested, and assimilated
We enjoy Christ's riches, and we eventually become His fullness, just as we enjoy the riches of America to become the fullness of America
Some Christian groups apparently have the riches of Christ, but we cannot see the fullness of Christ among them
In the Lord's recovery today we are 'churching,' we are practicing the proper church life, in order to build today's ark
In the Lord's recovery our Christ is the ark, something corporate that is built up not by God but by God's seekers
The ark saved Noah and his family not only from perdition under God's judgment but also from the evil generation of his day
There is no need for us to work out our salvation from eternal perdition-Christ accomplished this salvation once for all on the cross
None of us can do this work in ourselves, but because God is operating in us, we are able to work out our own salvation
It would be better for the Americans to send a missionary to the Far East to tell the heathen Chinese about Christianity
We thank God for all the godly forefathers who have gone before us and for all the godly ways we have inherited from them
We need to see that Christ is the Operator of God's economy in the universe and that we are His partners in this operation
He was not the first who was brought to the Lord, but he surely was the first who was commissioned to establish the churches
Peter was the first apostle to establish the churches, and Paul was the last one in the New Testament to establish the churches
The New Testament reveals that not long after the churches were established, they became damaged, or broken, like a torn fishing net
Acts 4:11 says, 'This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner'
The Jewish builders were supposed to be building God's house, but Christ, the living stone, was rejected by them
The Gentile believers and the Jewish believers are two walls of God's building that are joined by Christ as the cornerstone
God's eternal purpose is not merely to save a group of fallen sinners but to build His eternal habitation with His saved ones
In order to fulfill God's eternal purpose, Christ needs to be both the Savior for the salvation of sinners and the stone for God's building
It is not only the Jewish builders who put this stone aside; even the so-called builders in Christianity put this stone aside
It is not a rich salvation but a scarce salvation, one that delivers people out of hell but has nowhere to place them
It seems that they were saying, 'Paul, you have been bringing in many unclean Gentiles without circumcising them
It seems that Peter was telling the Jewish believers not to dissent from the apostle Paul but to receive what he wrote as Scripture
John's ministry was neither Jewish nor Gentile but heavenly, because John brought everything back to the beginning
The Epistles of Paul reveal that Jewish religious teachings and Greek philosophy had crept in to damage the church
John mended not by fighting against Jewish teaching and Greek philosophy but by saying, 'In the beginning was the Word
The Lord spoke this word to Peter in Matthew 4:19, which is a record of the second time Peter contacted the Lord
The first time Peter came to the Lord, the Lord said to him, 'You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas '
The first time Peter came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord immediately promised Peter that He would make him a stone
It is not that He is the stone so that He can be the Savior; rather, it is that He is the Savior so that He can be the stone
The New Testament believers are charged by God to build the church , which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem
When we see one another in the New Jerusalem, we will realize that what we were building in the churches was the New Jerusalem
Many saints who love the Lord and give everything for the church life do not realize it, but they are building the New Jerusalem
As a result, we know what the Lord is doing today, and we know what we are doing today in His recovery under His vision
We are not blindly preaching or ministering, trying to help others while we ourselves do not know where we are going
Now we need to see how we fallen, sinful, polluted, and contaminated human beings can become precious stones for God's building
Verse 23 tells us that we have been regenerated with an incorruptible seed, which is the living and abiding word of God
Soil can never produce a carnation flower if it does not have a carnation seed sown into it; it can be only a plot of soil
No amount of teaching concerning what a proper plant should look like can ever cause a plot of soil to produce a plant
Many teachers, such as Confucius, have taught man for centuries how to be proper and virtuous, but this teaching has not worked
In order to become precious stones for God's building, we also must drink the milk of the word so that we will grow
Peter 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation'
We should come to the Bible not mainly for teachings but mainly to drink the milk, to take in the nourishment, that we may grow
The building of the church is not carried out by organization or by a disorderly 'piling up'; it is entirely a matter of organic growth
The members of our physical body were not systematically organized, nor were they merely put together without any particular order
The proper church life in the Lord's recovery is not something organized or piled up but something that grows up
The Lord desires that the church be built up not by teaching but by the nourishment of the milk and the solid food in the word
We need to drop all the traditional concepts and turn to our spirit to see the churches as we have never seen them before
Though some in Christianity may oppose the Lord's recovery, no opposition can defeat us, for we are on the Lord's side
We simply need to take care of the hidden man in our heart, our human spirit, which is where the Lord Jesus is
In order to be transformed into precious stones for God's building, we also need to be separated from the world
Peter 3:20b says that by entering into the ark, 'a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water'
After passing through the Red Sea it would have been difficult for the children of Israel to return to Egypt because the sea blocked the way
We all need to give ourselves to experience this grace, for by it we will become God's building and thus fulfill God's eternal purpose
He stood before them and told them that Jesus Christ was not only the Savior but also the stone for God's building
In ancient times the Jews built their dwellings with three main kinds of stones: a foundation stone, a cornerstone, and a topstone
In a negative sense, Christ will be a crushing stone to the unbelieving Gentiles and a stone of stumbling to the unbelieving Jews
Petrified wood becomes stone not by the wood being changed in itself but by the element of certain minerals being wrought into the wood
We who are clay do not need to change our 'clay' nature; rather, we need to have Christ's stone nature added into us
He could not smoke cigarettes anymore, and something within him urged him to go to the people whom he had been mocking
The best way for her to make her task a pleasant experience is for her to call on the name of the Lord while she is working
Although we may believe in Jesus and receive Him as our Savior, if we do not call on His name, it will be difficult for us to enjoy Him
We may not be convinced of this, but if we will simply call on the name of the Lord Jesus for three minutes, we will never be the same
We are all pieces of natural wood, but the heavenly flow is daily flowing through us with the heavenly element
According to Ephesians 4:16, the building of the church as the Body of Christ is accomplished by every part of the Body
Regardless of how small and insignificant we consider ourselves to be, as long as we are in the church, we are a part of the Body
We are all like newborn babies, who have all their organs but whose organs do not function fully because of their immaturity
If we have the inspiration to stand up in a meeting to speak something for the Lord, but we are stuck in our seat, our seat has become a pew
Christians are talkative people outside the meeting hall, but when they come into the meeting hall, they are silent
Perhaps they believe that they should be seated and silent in order to be pious, godly people who are meeting in a decent order
The way this building occurs is first by Christ the Head producing the apostles by His death, resurrection, and ascension
If many saints say Amen to a brother's speaking, he will be encouraged and look forward to coming to the next meeting to function again
In contrast, in the Lord's recovery a brother may stand up in a meeting and testify briefly, 'I was born in an unbelieving family
If the meeting goes on for an hour with other saints functioning in a similar way, all the saints will be nourished and go home living
The church is built not directly by the Head in the heavens or by the apostles but by all the present members of a local church
When the domineering sisters are about to override their husbands, something they received in the meeting will stop them
In the beginning, in Genesis, we see the tree of life , and in John's ministry, in Revelation, we again see the tree of life
Christianitys traditional teaching concerning the Trinity has drugged people causing them to unconsciously believe that there are three Gods
When the Lord raised us up in His recovery, He showed us through our experience of the Lord that we have not three Gods but one
The Lord began to show us that God's being three persons is only one aspect of God; the other aspect is that God is one
Griffith Thomas, the well-known writer of an exposition on Romans, says, 'The term 'Person' is also sometimes objected to
Some teach that God the Father is one person, God the Son is another person, and God the Holy Spirit is another person
In the Lord's recovery we have been helped by the Lord not to be misled by the teaching that God is three separate persons
Regardless of whether we understand these two verses, we must receive them as the pure revelation of the Word of God
We should not care for the traditional teaching of any creed or organization more than the pure revelation of the Word of God'
Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is in us, Colossians 1:27 says that Christ the Son is in us, and John 14:17 says that the Spirit is in us
The speaker in verse 8, who is the sent One, is Jehovah of hosts, but in verses 9 and 11 He says, 'Jehovah of hosts has sent Me'
In today's Christianity the denominations consider one another to be wrong, yet they would not offend one another
In the Lord's recovery, however, the Lord has enlightened us and opened our eyes to see that denominations are wrong
Simply because there are genuine believers there, would you say that the Catholic Church is the proper church'?
We admit that there are many dear brothers and sisters in the denominations, but we can never say that the denominations are right
Now even if we tried to chase them away, they would say, 'Even if you brothers would not take this way, we will still take this way'
Many saints who have come into the Lord's recovery from denominations can testify that no one stole them or proselytized them
