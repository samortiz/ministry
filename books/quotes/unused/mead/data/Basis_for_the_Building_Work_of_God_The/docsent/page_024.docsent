   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING OF GOD BEING ACCOMPLISHED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY GOD AS MAN S LIFE GROWING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND MATURING IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have the light, we can see right away that God s salvation is not to save us from earth to heaven but to save us who are outside of God into God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the work God has been doing throughout the ages since creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible this work is called building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God wants to build Himself into man and build man into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know that this building work of God is accomplished by His coming to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This building of God is the pouring of oil upon the stones, as we mentioned before.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The stones are we the saved ones, and the oil is the Spirit of God, the transfiguration of God, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity God was the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He was manifested among men, He was the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He enters into man to be mingled with man and to be man s life, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the One in whom God has a relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oil being poured upon stones makes us living stones to be built into a living building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible uses another way to depict God s entering into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It says that the life of God is the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First John 3:9 says plainly that God s seed abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A seed contains life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God being life in us is just like a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He did not fall into the ground and die, He would abide alone; but if He died, He would bear much fruit John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through His resurrection the Lord regenerated us, making us alive from within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since then, we are God s wheat, God s crop, growing in the field of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please remember that this growth is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In regard to a farm, it is a matter of growth; in regard to a building, it is a matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two matters are one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not grow, you cannot be built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you grow a little, then you can be built up a little more in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you grow into Christ, the Head, in a certain matter, then in that matter you can be built up with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When all of us have grown and matured, this building of God will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would ask you, brothers and sisters, are you God s farm, God s harvest?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe you would all acknowledge that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, I would further ask, are you mature?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have not matured, and if the Lord comes today, do you think He will reap you?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only when the harvest is fully ripened will it be reaped and gathered into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What will you do since you have not ripened?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today Christianity tells people that they will go to heaven if they believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not know what kind of thought or concept this is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They say that this is due to the efficacy of the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please remember that redemption through the blood is only one aspect of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is another aspect, which is the aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is true that the blood solved all of our problems before God and brought us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, please remember that it is the growth in life that causes us to grow into God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God does not consider us as glass vessels that are good enough if He merely washes us clean with the blood and places us before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He has washed us with the blood, but He also wants to come into us to be our life that we may become a living harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This living harvest needs to grow and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let me ask you: Is there a lord of the harvest who reaps the crops that are still green in the field?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No, the crops must be ripe before they can be gathered into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we understand that the house is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The house is the destination of the harvest after it is fully ripened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not refer to a heavenly mansion; it refers to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate destination of us who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, those who are immature cannot yet go into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we should not believe the erroneous doctrines in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They say that after a person believes in Jesus, he is washed in the blood and will go to heaven after death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is an inaccurate statement.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is true that if you believe in the Lord Jesus, His blood washes away your sins, and when you die your spirit and soul can be comforted in Paradise in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet I still have to ask, have you grown and matured since you were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul could say that he was matured.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 1 Corinthians 9 Paul said, I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air...lest perhaps having preached to others which is preaching to others concerning maturity, concerning the gaining of the reward , I myself may become disapproved vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he wrote Philippians, he was already quite old.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time he was locked away in a Roman prison, and he still said, I do not account of myself to have laid hold...Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal 3:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That pursuit is the growth, and it is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As crops, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As a building, we need to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are all running a race on a course, so we need to pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even in his old age Paul said that he was pursuing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, in 2 Timothy 4 he said that he was about to be martyred for the Lord: For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He knew that he had matured.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I ask you brothers and sisters, if today you were to depart from the world and your spirit went to be in Abraham s bosom, would you be able to say what Paul said?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul could say that he had matured and was waiting for the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Can you say the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, with regard to being washed by the precious blood, you are a redeemed person; you can come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, you need to keep in mind that there is another aspect; that is, God s life needs to grow within you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God needs to build you into His building.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Have you matured?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Have you been built?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is a great matter.</S>
