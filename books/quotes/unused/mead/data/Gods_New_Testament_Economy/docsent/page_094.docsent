   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:11, 18-21; Gen 2:11-12; 1 Cor 3:12a; 1 Pet 2:4-5; Matt 13:45-46; 2 Pet 1:4; 2 Cor 3:18 GOLD, PEARLS, AND PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The basic elements of the structure of the New Jerusalem are gold, pearls, and precious stones Rev 21:11, 18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gold is an element created by God and characterized by its unchangeableness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pearls are produced by oysters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When an oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The particle of sand is something created by God, yet the life-juice of the oyster is added to this particle by secretion and a pearl is produced in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Precious stones are not created, but transformed from things created.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Due to intense heat and pressure these stones were transformed from their original form and nature to a transformed form and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GENESIS 1 2</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gold in typology in the Bible refers to the divine, uncreated nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we would pay our attention to this matter of gold when we study the Bible, we would realize that gold is a special item in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 1 and 2 we see God s creation of man, the tree of life, the flow of the river, and the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 1 and 2 are very economical and these two chapters cover a great span of the creation of the universe and unveil to us God s eternal purpose, His original intention in man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following the gold in Genesis 2 we see bdellium.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Bdellium is a kind of pearl produced from a tree s secretion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the resin of the tree, the tree s life secretion, the tree s sap, congeals into gum, this gum is considered as a kind of pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following the bdellium in Genesis 2 is the onyx stone, the precious stone v. 12b . Finally, we see a woman named Eve who was Adam s counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord God took a rib from Adam s side and built it into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, in Genesis 1 and 2 we see ten significant items God, creation, man, the tree of life, the river that flows, gold, bdellium, onyx stone, a wife, and a couple who became one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you understand these ten items you know the real significance of God s creation, especially of man, recorded in the first two chapters of His divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>REVELATION 21 22</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the conclusion of the divine revelation in the last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, we see a city built with gold, pearls, and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the real structure of a building the first item is the base or foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the base the doors are set up and the wall is built up to fit the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In any building you need the base, the doors, and the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Jerusalem the gold is for the base, pearls are for the gates, and the precious stones are for the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The record of these three materials in Genesis 2:12 is in this sequence because this is the sequence of building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul refers to the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the proper building up of the church Paul mentions three kinds of materials gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of the bdellium or pearl Paul mentions silver in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis 2, in 1 Corinthians 3, and in Revelation 21 we see the materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In these three portions of the Scriptures the first item is gold and the last item is precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second items in these three portions are all somewhat different.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis there is bdellium, in 1 Corinthians there is silver, and in Revelation there are pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is quite marvelous to see the consistency of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Genesis 2:12 we see three materials in typology for God s building and in 1 Corinthians 3 we also see three materials for the actual building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul says that he laid the unique foundation and that we should build on this foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul, of course, is not talking about a material building but about the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say that the Body of Christ can be built with gold, silver, and precious stones indicates that these three materials are signs which signify something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is with these the apostles and all spiritual believers build the church on the unique foundation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Silver in typology according to Exodus 30 always typifies redemption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>11-16; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>38:25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The building materials of the church are first the gold referring to God with His divine nature, and second the silver referring to the Redeemer with His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also must look into the significance of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to John 1, Andrew went and found his brother Simon Peter and brought him to Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By that time Peter was a muddy person.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter Gk. means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time Simon was not a piece of stone, but a piece of mud.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he came to the Lord, however, the Lord immediately changed his name.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we reach the book of Revelation we see that on the twelve foundation stones of the holy city there are twelve names 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Undoubtedly, Peter is the first foundation stone jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the Apostles were created pieces of clay, but they were regenerated and transformed into precious stones for God s eternal building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Gospel of John, Peter was named a stone by the Lord and in John s Revelation this same Peter is one of the twelve foundation stones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord s word in John 1 concerning Peter being a stone was a prophecy which was fully fulfilled in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even at the time when the Lord was going to be crucified, Peter was still a piece of mud and not a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He first boasted that he would never deny the Lord and eventually in the same night he denied the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time none of us could recognize or acknowledge Peter as the first layer of the foundation of the New Jerusalem, God s eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was still quite muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In between John s Gospel and his Revelation are Peter s Epistles.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All of us believers including Peter are the living stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After he experienced Christ in His resurrection and ascension, Peter declared that he was one of the precious stones for the building up of a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>John 1, 1 Peter 2, and Revelation 21 all refer to Peter.</S>
