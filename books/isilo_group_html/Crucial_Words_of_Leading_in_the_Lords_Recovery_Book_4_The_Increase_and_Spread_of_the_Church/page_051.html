<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
IN EVERY HOME</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVERS IN THE LORD HAVING<br />
A GOSPEL-PREACHING LIFE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;From house to house...announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ&rdquo; means that the gospel can be preached in every home and that the gospel should be preached in every home (Acts 5:42). When we see the expression <em>announcing the gospel,</em> our inner being leaps because, as believers, we have a gospel-preaching life in us. This life can never be fully quenched. As long as we believe into the Lord and have the Lord&rsquo;s life, there will always be a response in our inner being when the gospel is mentioned no matter what our condition is. When we pray and sing hymns related to the gospel, we also have a feeling that the gospel is glorious. The more we preach the gospel, the stronger our inner being becomes and the more feeling we have for the gospel.</p>
<p>The increase and spread of the church is carried out through the preaching of the gospel. Without the preaching of the gospel, it is difficult for the church to increase and spread. The book of Acts concerns the spread of the church, and it contains numerous records of preaching the gospel. The church was able to spread because there were many groups of disciples who were witnesses of the Lord. They were not pastors or preachers but the Lord&rsquo;s living witnesses. In every place their primary work was to preach the gospel. They preached the gospel in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth (1:8). The book of Acts is a record of the saints&rsquo; preaching of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH&mdash;THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>The way for the increase and spread of the church has been laid out clearly before us. The basis and means for this increase and spread is through the building up of small groups. The preaching of the gospel cannot be carried out by a spiritual &ldquo;giant&rdquo; or by a few great spiritual men; rather, it must be carried out through groups of disciples, who gather in the cities where they live and who announce the gospel from house to house. Going from house to house is simply the gatherings of the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The &ldquo;Defensive&rdquo; Function of Small Groups&mdash;<br />
Upholding and Restoring the Saints</h2>
<p>The first function of a group gathering is to sustain the brothers and sisters who meet regularly. Although many saints meet regularly, the big meetings cannot uphold their spiritual life. Through the building up of small groups, the saints have more opportunities to fellowship and pray with one another. This makes it easy to sustain their spiritual life.</p>
<p>A small group should also function to restore brothers and sisters who have not met for a long time. In the days to come, many testimonies will confirm this burden as we practice the group meetings. The small group gatherings fill up a lack in the ability of big meetings to restore those who have been absent from the meetings for a long time.</p>
<p>Those who have been absent from the meetings often feel ashamed to come to a big meeting, and they do not know how to function in such a meeting. However, the fellowship in a small group gathering warms and comforts them as if they were at home. Through this warm feeling, they can gradually be restored. The small groups are not an army or a school but a family. In a family there is warmth as well as love. With love and warmth we can restore our dear brothers and sisters one by one. This is the &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; function of the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The &ldquo;Offensive&rdquo; Function of Small Groups&mdash;<br />
Every Home Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>Although the small groups can uphold existing saints and restore dormant saints, the increase and spread of the church will not proceed in a full way if we focus only on this &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; function. We also must focus on the &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; function of preaching the gospel from house to house. Through the supply of life and the teaching of the truth, we can uphold and restore the brothers and sisters. Yet when we look around, we still see many relatives, friends, and neighbors who are unbelievers, and we surely have some feeling for them. The city of Taipei is like a big fishpond. In this fishpond there are many who need the gospel. These &ldquo;fish&rdquo; should be the target of our work. We should not only uphold our existing brothers and sisters and restore our lost brothers and sisters; we should also go on the offensive to reach our gospel friends, that is, those who have not yet believed in the Lord, so that they may know the gospel and receive the blessings of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4: The Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
