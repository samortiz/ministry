   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After I was saved, I began to love to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I desired very much to know the Bible and wanted to know what the Bible was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although I was still a poor student, I tried my best to secure spiritual books and books on Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not long after that, I obtained some books by Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His books opened my understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He pointed out again and again that those who have believed in Christ have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The cross of Christ has terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has no intention for us to sin; neither does God have any intention for us to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on the Bible, he said that both good and evil belong to the same tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tree of knowledge of good and evil bears four kinds of fruit: knowledge, good, evil, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But there is another tree that is in opposition to this tree the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This tree, being of life, has nothing to do with knowledge, good, evil, or death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Nee also pointed out that today man seeks only after knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he has knowledge, he tries his best to do good and to be moral.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in the end, the result is evil and death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this, Brother Nee pointed out that in the New Testament, the Lord Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord did not ask man to labor for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead He placed Himself before man as man's food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly" John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only is the Lord Jesus life, but He came that man may have life and have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is also the bread of life to be man's food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst" John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, He said, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever....As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me" John 6:51, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee told us that this is what God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not want us to sin and to commit evil; neither does He want us to do good and be moral.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants to be man's life, to satisfy man's hunger and quench his thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These words of Brother Nee's rendered me great help in my spiritual life and in the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
