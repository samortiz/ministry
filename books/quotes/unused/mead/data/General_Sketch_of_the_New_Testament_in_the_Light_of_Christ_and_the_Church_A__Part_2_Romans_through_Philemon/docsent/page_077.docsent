   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN TITUS AND PHILEMON Scripture Reading: Titus 2:14; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1-25 THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN TITUS A Confirmation of 1 and 2 Timothy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following the two books to Timothy, there is still the need of the short Epistle to Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently this book is nearly the same as 1 and 2 Timothy, although it is not as complete, but it is still part of the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What then is the purpose of Paul's letter to Titus?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a principle that with all important matters and main points in the Scriptures, there is the need of confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Titus is a repetition of Paul's Epistles to Timothy to serve as confirmation that at least two young co-workers of the apostle Paul received the same kind of instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle in the Scriptures is that a testimony must be borne by at least two or three witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, after the two books of Timothy, there is the book to Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only do these books confirm each other, but the two recipients, Timothy and Titus, also could confirm each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the apostle Paul passed away, these two young co-workers were still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If only one of them had received instruction from Paul, there would not be a testimony or confirmation for that instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, since there were two persons who received the same instruction, if someone rose up to argue and dispute an issue, Timothy and Titus could be a strong confirmation for one another and for the instructions themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Particular Christian Walk and Church Practice</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, there is at least one matter found in Titus which is not mentioned in the Epistles to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 14 of chapter two says, "Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A particular people is a special term in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should be particular not only in the inner life but also in our church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not follow the system of the world, and we should not make the practice of the church life a common thing that fits our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both our Christian walk and our practice of the church must be particular.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be particular is to be different from the common way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we are a particular people living on the earth, our walk, our worship, and our service to God must not be common, according to the common system or on the common course.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, there is no need to be purposely peculiar, but if we go on not according to the traditional teachings but according to the Lord's inner, living guidance, we will automatically be different from the common worldly system.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how good the worldly system is, it is still according to the course of this age, and as such it is no doubt of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our walk and our church practice, however, must be out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God must be the source, the nature, and the origin of our particular walk, life, and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever we have must be something of God and one hundred percent different from the worldly system and contradictory to the course of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The worldly system, the course of the age, are of the devil, but we are following the inner guidance of the Lord; therefore, we are spontaneously different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must try our best not to be influenced by the Christianity which we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For nearly two thousand years, Christianity has been drifting away from God's particular divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we should not trust in the things of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should put a big question mark on them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must lay these things aside and come back to the Lord and to His Word, to study His Word and seek His guidance in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If possible, we should practice the church life outside of so-called Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only things in which we should be the same as Christianity are those things that are entirely from the Spirit and from the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must go along, not with tradition, but with the inner guidance and the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
