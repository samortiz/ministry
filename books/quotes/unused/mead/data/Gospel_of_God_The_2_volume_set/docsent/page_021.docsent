   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But, brothers and sisters, God's love does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since God is love, the matter of grace comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is true that love is precious, but love must have its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When love is expressed, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace is love expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Love is something in God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when this love comes to you, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God is only love, He is very abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But thank the Lord that although love is something abstract, with God it is immediately turned into something substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The inward love is abstract, but the outward grace has given it substance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, you may have pity on a pauper, and you may love him and have sympathy for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you would not give him food and clothing, the most you could say is that you love him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You could not say that you are grace to him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When can you say that you have grace toward him?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you give him a bowl of rice or a piece of clothing or some money, and when the food, clothing, or money reach him, your love becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The difference between love and grace lies in the fact that love is within and grace is without.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Love is primarily an inward feeling, while grace is an outward act.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When love is turned into action, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When grace is traced back to its feeling, it is love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without love, grace cannot come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace exists because love exists.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The definition of grace is not just the act of love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must add something else to this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is the act of love upon the destitute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God loves His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there is no element of grace in this love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One cannot say that God deals with His Son in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God also loves the angels, but that cannot be considered as grace either.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why is not the Father's love toward the Son and God's love toward the angels grace?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason is that there is no destitution and deprivation involved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is only love; there is no thought of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only when there is deprivation and destitution, when there is no way for one to solve his problems on his own, is love realized as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we are sinners, we are those with problems; and we have no way to solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But God is love, and His love is manifested to us as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, when love flows on the same level, it is simply love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when it flows down, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, those who have never been on the low end can never receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Love can also flow up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when it does, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Love can also flow between equal heights.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When it does, it is not grace either.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only when love flows downward is it grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you want to be above God, or if you want to be equal with God, you will never see the day of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only those who are below God can see the day of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is what the Bible shows us about the difference between love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the Bible mentions the love of the Lord Jesus, it pays more attention to the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible also speaks of the grace of God, but it pays more attention to the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am not saying that there is no mention of the love of the Lord Jesus and the grace of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the emphasis in the Bible is on the love of God and the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How did Paul greet the church in Corinth?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You cannot change the sentence to read, "the grace of God and the love of the Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You cannot do this, because the emphasis of the Bible is on the love of God and the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because it was the Lord Jesus who accomplished salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was He who substantiated love and accomplished grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The love of God became grace through the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the Bible tells us that the law was given through Moses, but grace came through Jesus Christ John 1:17 .</S>
