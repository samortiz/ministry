   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Nourishing Words</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Exercise unto Godliness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Timothy 4:6-8 there are two important matters, the nourishing words and the exercise unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To minister Christ to others first requires ourselves to be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being nourished is for growth in life, differing merely from being taught, which is a matter of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having been nourished with Christ, we shall then have Christ as the food, the life-supply, the nourishing words, to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Godliness is Christ lived out of us as the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This very Christ is today the Spirit dwelling in our spirit Rom 8:9-10; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit to live Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is of crucial importance that we exercise ourselves unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Inwardly we need nourishment, and outwardly we should have godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From within we should be nourished with Christ, and then we should have a living which is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Healthy Words and the Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>according to Godliness</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 6:3 there are two kinds of words: the words of the Lord Jesus which are the healthy words and the teaching according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life John 6:63 ; hence, healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord s words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Desire to Be Rich</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another crucial point is found in 6:9 and 10: But those who resolve to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the love of money is a root of all evils, which some having aspired after have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The resolve mentioned here is related to the strong desire to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the love of riches, not the possession of them, that leads the avaricious into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some are actually rich; some are rich in their desire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This evil desire ruins and destroys them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ruin here implies destruction, and destruction implies perdition, both temporal and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who resolve to be rich fall into a snare, as into a net, and also into many foolish and harmful lustful desires, which cause men to drown or sink into ruin or destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word rendered aspired after in verse 10 means craved for, longed for.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those with this craving have wandered away from the faith; they have been led astray from the contents of our belief, from the faith of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Man of God Laying Hold on the Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In contrast to the man of riches desiring to be rich in 6:9 and 10 is the man of God laying hold on the eternal life in verses 11 and 12: But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man of God is one who partakes of God s life and nature John 1:13; 2 Peter 1:4 , thus being one with Him in His life and nature 1 Cor 6:17 and thereby expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This corresponds with the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be men of riches wandering away from the truth that is revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather we should be men of God laying hold on the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2 Timothy 1:1 Paul said he was an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul was an apostle established by the Lord according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul was not an apostle according to letters, or ordinances, or ordination, but according to the promise of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He enjoyed eternal life in his apostolic ministry.</S>
