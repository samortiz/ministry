 <p><strong>WEEK 8 &mdash; DAY 6</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Heb. 12:10 ...That we might partake of His holiness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phil. 2:13 For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for <em>His</em> good pleasure.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">Holiness</h2>
<p>Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God....The mentioning of &ldquo;holy&rdquo; three times, as in Isaiah 6:3, implies the thought of God being triune....The emphasis here is that the Triune God is holy and is triply holy, referring to the quality of God&rsquo;s nature&mdash;God&rsquo;s being. What God is, is holy. To partake of God&rsquo;s holiness (Heb. 12:10) is to partake of the quality of His nature, of what He is.</p>
<p>Holiness is neither sinlessness nor perfection. Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common....For us, God&rsquo;s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and to have our whole being permeated [and saturated] with God Himself.<sup>36</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Righteousness</h2>
<p>Another attribute of God is righteousness....Whereas holiness is related to God&rsquo;s inward nature, righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s outward acts, ways, actions, and activities. Everything God does is righteous.</p>
<p>What is the righteousness of God? The righteousness of God is what God is in His action with respect to justice and righteousness. God is just and right. Whatever God is in His justice and righteousness constitutes His righteousness.</p>
<p>Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God&rsquo;s righteousness. You may be fervent for the Lord today. But in the future you may fail Him and become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you. At such a time you need to praise God for His righteousness. Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts (Heb. 1:3). Our experience may fluctuate, but God remains righteous forever. Whenever we confess our sins, claim the blood of Jesus, and appeal to God&rsquo;s righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us [1 John 1:9].</p>
<p>Our experience of Christ rests on the foundation of God&rsquo;s righteousness. The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God&rsquo;s righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God&rsquo;s throne (Psa. 89:14). God has shown forth His righteousness by forgiving us of our sins. In this way God has proved that He is righteous. Now such righteousness of God is our solid foundation.<sup>37</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>The Triune God refers to God the person, while the Divine Trinity refers to the main attribute of the Godhead. For example, saying that someone is a faithful person is different from saying that he is faithfulness. A faithful person refers to the man. His faithfulness refers to his being faithful, his virtue. In a general way God is dispensing Himself into us, but in a particular, actual, and practical way God is dispensing His Trinity into us.</p>
<p>We should never forget Philippians 2:13. God is not only in us, but He is also operating, or working, in us. God is in us as the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit....We are not only experiencing God, but we are also experiencing God as the Triune. We are experiencing the Trinity of the Godhead. The Father is in us [Eph. 4:6], the Son is in us [2 Cor. 13:5], and the Spirit is in us [Rom. 8:9]. These are not three persons, but these are the Trinity of the one God. In other words, this Divine Trinity is the strongest attribute of the Godhead. His faithfulness, His love, His kindness, and other attributes are not above this attribute. The top attribute of the divine person is His Trinity. His Trinity is constituted solely with His person, and His person is in the Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<sup>38</sup></p>
