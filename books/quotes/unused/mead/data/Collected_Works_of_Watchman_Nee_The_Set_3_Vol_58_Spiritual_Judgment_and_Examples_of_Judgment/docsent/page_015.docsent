   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 2 Date:June 22, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my youth I studied in a non-Christian school.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was saved through reading about the Lord's love in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time the school I attended forbade anyone to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I broke the Bible into small sections and put them in my pocket so that I could carry it with me easily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day I read Acts 6:4, which says, "We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I received a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My family was not agreeable to this, and some of them opposed my desire to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God is my all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I brushed aside their oppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later I was enrolled in the Jin Ning Women's Seminary in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But what went on there was not agreeable to my spiritual taste; I did not receive much help from the classes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I left the seminary and worked among the women in a Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once I fell from a train.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The next day I vomited blood and found that I had hurt my spine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I knew that the Lord was dealing with me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not want me to be bound to the Presbyterian Church by human affections and circumstantial needs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I left.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later I went to work at the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was friction among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was difficult for me to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I became discouraged and could not rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet the Lord's love constrained me, and I endured.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through this I learned to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit and to drop the self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once I incurred a heart disease and suffered much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was so sick that I was ready to die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I have never regretted taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the church was on the subject of giving our all, I struggled for a week and wondered whether I should give my all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I knew that if I did not yield my all, I would be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God, however, did not want me to be finished, so I offered up my all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now I have no more problems, except with my "self."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once I let go of the self, there will be no more problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have no desire to do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All I want is to live according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our sister's testimony shows that she is a frank and straightforward person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when such frankness and straightforwardness is mixed with the spirit, it is hard to deal with the former characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man's virtues and characteristics exert much influence upon his condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These virtues and characteristics should be nurtured in the spirit and covered by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As far as history is concerned, there was a fundamental problem with the church in Shanghai during the time our sister was there: Everyone was doing his own thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was no good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was no supply of the Body, and the work was not in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was no authority, no arrangement, and everything was left to run its own course.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But now we all have seen our mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the light we have received is strong enough, our sister will be spared many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As far as our sister's personal experiences are concerned, I will repeat the statement that unless we are ready to let God touch us, our spirit cannot climb to a higher level.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord bless our sister and manifest more of His work through her.</S>
