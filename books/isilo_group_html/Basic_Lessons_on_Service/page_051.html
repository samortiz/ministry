The Two Kidneys&#151;<br>the Most Tender Part of the Inwards</H2><P>Now we need to consider what the two kidneys signify (Lev. 3:4, 10, 15). Of all the inward parts, the kidneys are among the smallest. Furthermore, the kidneys are the most tender of the inward parts. This indicates that we need some small yet most tender things within us toward God the Father. Within us God does not want big things. Within us the Father wants small things which are very tender and precious. The kidneys are protected by the fat, which means that the small yet tender and precious things within us toward the Father are protected by the inward riches.</P><P>What we are speaking of here is altogether based upon our experiences. If we do not have the rich experiences of life, we cannot have the small, tender, and precious things within us toward God the Father. With the inwards, which are so sweet to the Father, the size means nothing, but the quantity does. The more fat there is, the better. With the life of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, there were the riches, the abundance in quantity, but there was no greatness in size.</P><P>An illustration of this can be seen in John 7. In this chapter the Lord's brothers in the flesh told Him to go to Judea and manifest Himself to the world (vv. 3-4), but the Lord responded by saying, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready" (v. 6). Such an instance shows us the tenderness, the preciousness, and the riches of life within the Lord. His life was not one of a great work, a great career, or a great activity. Although He was the Son of the Almighty God, He was willing to be limited in not doing anything. His brothers in the flesh challenged Him to manifest Himself publicly, to do something great to make a name, but He said His time had not yet come. He liked to be small. In His life with the Father, there was an inward restriction. This shows us the kidneys of the peace offering offered to the Father with the smallness, the tenderness, and the preciousness.</P><P>No human word can adequately express this revelation, but this instance in John 7 shows us the Lord's inward being as typified by the kidneys of the peace offering with the fat around them. If we are great, spiritual giants according to the way of today's Christianity, we will not be able to offer the fat with the two kidneys. If we read the four Gospels to see the life of Jesus, we can see His inward being as typified by the inward parts of the peace offering. We can see that His inward being was rich in life with something tender and small, yet so precious to God the Father. This fully corresponds with our experiences. This indicates that strength and power signified by the thigh do not satisfy the Father. The Father desires the inward parts of Christ signified by the fat and the kidneys.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
