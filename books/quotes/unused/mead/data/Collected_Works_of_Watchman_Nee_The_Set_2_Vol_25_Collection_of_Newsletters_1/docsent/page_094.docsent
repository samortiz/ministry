   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Answering Letter</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to Brother Ta Ching:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I met with Brother Wang Yu T'ing for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We spoke about the importance of having a meeting for all the co-workers from various places.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There should be one at least once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are already praying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the Lord is willing, we hope to meet in the fall when it is cool.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We plan to hold it in Ting Pu T'ou.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, Brother Wang cannot give you an answer concerning the conference in Feng Ch'uan at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May the Lord's will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank you for your greetings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Wu Sheng</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A LETTER FROM TAISHAN,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To the sisters in the Lord in Shanghai:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We wrote a letter to you when we left Swatow and told you something of the condition in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we will tell you something of the condition of Kung Ho City in Taishan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We arrived in Kung Ho City on July 12.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Kung Ho City is a country town in Tai Cheng County.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although it is only fifteen or sixteen miles from the city, everything is very rustic with the exception of a few new buildings in town.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We began the work on July 16.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We worked for five days every week.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first half of the first week we only preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second half of the week, half of the work we did was for sinners and half for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some were clearly saved, but the number was not large.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were four or five who said they believed, but I dared not say with assurance that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second week was entirely for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank God, most of the sisters received a little help.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although it was very hot the first week, there were usually about one hundred people in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the second week, there were two meetings a day, and it rained every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The weather was cool, like the beginning of fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There were between forty to fifty people in the meetings every day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God really graced us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the weather had been too hot and the attendance too mixed, it would not have been so easy to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These last two days I have been doing a little individual work with the sinners who are on the borderline.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After meeting and talking with them one by one, I know their situation, and it is easier to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are seven or eight like this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please pray for them also that they may be saved soon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord really used Sisters Lei and Lin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Over the past few years they have already gained more than forty sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These two sisters were originally going to give us hospitality, but then all the sisters wanted to have a part.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They also manifested their diligence in other matters besides hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their offerings in love covered all our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they live in the country, they are the same as the sisters in Swatow in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the few sisters in the Presbyterian Church who come every day to hear the message have manifested their love in the Lord in their treatment of me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I say this, not in the way of praising them for being good to me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have really seen the Lord's work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes I am afraid it is difficult for them, but the responsible sisters said that they are usually like this in their treatment of others because the love of the Lord constrains them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I also hope that the sisters in Shanghai will treat all the sisters from other localities who pass through Shanghai and all the working sisters in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I always thank my God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The love of all the sisters always causes me to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I can only ask the Lord to reward you and them richly!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are quite a few sisters here with a good ability to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the gifts of Sister Lei and Sister Lin are in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They teach during the week, and this presents some difficulties in the matter of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This matter requires your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I told the two sisters that children are born, but there is no one to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They hope a sister who is a little deeper in spiritual life can come for a longer time to cultivate the sisters for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every day I have a time with the two sisters to pray together and to talk about the matters of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I confess that the only thing that can be of any help to others is for us to first learn the lesson before God and pass through the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Otherwise, it is hard to escape being idealistic, and there will not be any assurance in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Tomorrow August 1 , I will leave Kung Ho City for Kung Yi Pu more than ten miles from here .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I will stay there for four or five days and work with a small number of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On August 8, I will go to Kwangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On August 11, I will go to Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I will hold meetings in Hong Kong for five or six days beginning on August 13.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then perhaps I will go to Amoy for five or six days.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not know yet if I will go to Hsing Hua.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I still must receive a letter from the co-working sisters and see what the feeling in the Body is before deciding.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have slept pretty well this trip.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Every time I leave a place, God always has His special arrangement with regard to time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please give thanks with me to God for all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I pray for you often.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If there is a special need, I pray for it almost every day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have already prayed for me, please continue to pray to God so that He will bless all the seeds that have been sown and that they will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May God bless you in all things!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Your sister,</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Ruth Lee</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>P.S. There is a sister here who is a young widow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She sells soybean sprouts for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She has to support her mother-in-law and a young daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Her father-in-law is abroad and does not remember her financially.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God has blessed her.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When others cannot sell their bean sprouts, she is always able to finish selling hers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When she sells them, she testifies for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>She can read.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, she must get up in the middle of the night and is very exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the country people see that her business is good, they often try to cheat her.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>She is very kind and has considerable compassion for others, so she often lends and gives money to people.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, because the people think that she is gullible, they try to cheat her even more.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Her face shows the suffering of her labor.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>She wants to change jobs to be a temporary laborer either in a hospital or a school .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Please ask God to open a way for her.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>One day she gave me twenty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I consider that her money is as the water of Bethlehem 2 Sam 23:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I could not bear to drink it; I could only offer it for the printing costs of The Glad Tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I explained this to her, and she had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Sister Lei Mei Hsiung is too tired; she must rest for at least a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Please pray for her also.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Ruth Lee</S>
