<h1 class="title">SALVATION</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation includes all the topics we previously covered, such as forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, eternal life, release, and other such blessings. A person who receives these heavenly blessings in Christ is saved. However, in the Bible God speaks of at least five kinds of salvation, and if we do not clearly distinguish between these five kinds of salvation, we will be confused about what the Bible says about salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ETERNAL SALVATION</h2>
<p>The first kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is eternal salvation. We receive this salvation at the time we believe; it includes the enlivening of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Source</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:8-9).</p>
<p>The salvation spoken of here is eternal salvation, and it refers to our spirit being enlivened (cf. v. 5). This is by God&rsquo;s grace. Because of His love, God gave us grace; this grace is the source of our eternal salvation. The source of our eternal salvation is the grace that comes from God&rsquo;s love; in other words, grace issues in our eternal salvation. Since our eternal salvation does not come from ourselves or our works, no one can boast; it is the gift of God. Our works have absolutely nothing to do with eternal salvation. If our works could gain eternal salvation for us, it would be easy for us to boast in ourselves. Since God&rsquo;s grace is the source of our eternal salvation, we can only praise Him for His grace and give glory to Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who has saved us...not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9).</p>
<p>God saved us according to His own purpose and grace, not according to our works. Our salvation is unrelated to our works; it is entirely according to God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:5).</p>
<p>God gave us eternal salvation according to His mercy. His giving had absolutely nothing to do with any works in righteousness which we did. According to our real condition, we did not have any works in righteousness, and what is more, we were so full of sin that we were unworthy of God&rsquo;s grace. Thank God not only for His grace but also for His mercy. His mercy caused His grace to reach us even when we were unworthy of salvation. His grace prepared salvation for us, and His mercy caused His salvation to reach us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 15:11).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s saving grace reaches us through the Lord Jesus (John 1:17). Through this grace He accomplished salvation for us and completed all the things necessary for our salvation. Our salvation is through His grace, not our works.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus...will save His people&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:21).</p>
<p>The source of our eternal salvation is God&rsquo;s grace, and the foundation of our eternal salvation is the Lord Jesus Himself. He is God incarnated to be our Savior. <em>Jesus,</em> the Greek form of the Hebrew <em>Joshua</em> (Num. 13:16), means &ldquo;Jehovah Savior&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo; As our Savior, His name is Jesus. He is named Jehovah because He came to save us. He is Jehovah coming to be our Savior; He is God Himself coming as our salvation. Without Him, even God&rsquo;s grace cannot save us. God&rsquo;s grace, which accomplishes salvation, comes through Him. He is the means of God&rsquo;s salvation, the foundation of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A Savior, Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:23; see also Luke 2:11).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Savior established by God, so He is the foundation of our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Grace...has been manifested through...our Savior Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9-10).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace in saving us was manifested through the Lord Jesus. Although God has grace, it could not have been manifested without Christ.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:9).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the door to God&rsquo;s salvation. People must pass through Him to enter into God&rsquo;s salvation. Whoever enters through Him participates in God&rsquo;s salvation and is saved.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 4:12).</p>
<p>While there are sages and heroes among men, there is no Savior other than the Lord Jesus. Apart from Him there is no salvation. There is no name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved other than the precious name of Jesus. Only the Lord Jesus is the Savior established by God. He is God Himself coming as our Savior. Only He is the foundation of our salvation. His name is the only reliable name in the universe that saves people.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:15; see also Luke 19:10).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was God in the heavens. He was incarnated to be a man because He wanted to be the Savior of sinners. Therefore, Christ Jesus, who is God become man, is the foundation and means by which sinners are saved.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
