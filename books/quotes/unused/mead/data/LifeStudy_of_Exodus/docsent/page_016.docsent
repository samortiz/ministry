   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN, UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE HEAD OF THE WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as the head of every man is Christ, so the head of the woman is the man 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man, however, should not be the head of the woman in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He should be the head only as he himself is under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, Christ is under the headship of God, and, on the other hand, He is the head over every man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In like manner, man, on the one hand, should be under the headship of Christ, and, on the other hand, he should be the head of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not an easy matter to be both under the headship and to be the head over others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in the life of Christ we see an excellent example of how this is worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The four Gospels reveal that Christ was always under the headship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, simultaneously He was the head of all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ was never independent of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 5:30 He said, I can do nothing from Myself, and in John 5:19 He said, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son was always under the headship of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, He also exercised the headship over others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, He dealt with Peter very strictly whenever Peter acted as if he were the head and lived an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord corrected Peter by causing him to realize the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as Christ was under the headship of God the Father, so Peter had to be under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this we see that God is the head of Christ and that Christ, under the headship of God, is the head of every man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, man, under the headship of Christ, is the head of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MAN, TYPIFYING CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SIGNIFYING THE INDEPENDENT LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a picture of the relationship between God and man, man represents God, and woman represents man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this sense man, typifying Christ, signifies the independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With respect to being under the headship of God, Christ has a dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But with respect to being the head of every man, Christ has an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that Christ is dependent on God, but independent of us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In relation to God, Christ s life is a dependent life, but in relation to us, His life is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man typifies Christ as the One with an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With respect to Christ, the married brothers have a dependent life, but with respect to their wives, they have an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>V. WOMAN, TYPIFYING MAN,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>SIGNIFYING THE DEPENDENT LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as man represents God, woman represents man in his relation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this sense woman, typifying man, signifies the dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With man there are two aspects, both dependence and independence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But with woman there is only dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is God, not man, who has not allowed the woman to have an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>MAN TO BE A REAL FEMALE,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>LIVING A LIFE DEPENDENT ON GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man should not be a male, but a female, one who lives a life of dependence on God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only such a female life is useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Exodus, a book of pictures, this female life is portrayed by the midwives in chapter one and by all the females in chapter two Moses mother and sister, the female slave, Pharaoh s daughter, and the daughters of the priest of Midian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All men should be such females.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>MAN S INDEPENDENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BEING REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man s independence of God is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The moment we become independent, we become rebellious against God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because the male life is independent and rebellious, God cannot use it for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
