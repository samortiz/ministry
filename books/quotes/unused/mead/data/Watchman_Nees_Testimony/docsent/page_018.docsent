   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I wrote The Spiritual Man during my long illness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When it was ready for publication, about four thousand dollars were needed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since there were no means on hand, I asked God to fill the need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only four co-workers knew of this need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one else knew.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before long the Lord provided four hundred dollars, and we entered into a contract with a printer to commence printing the book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was agreed that should we fail to pay the subsequent installments, we would not only forfeit the cash down payment of four hundred dollars, but we would also pay for the default.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We therefore prayed concerning this matter with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time I was still confined to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever the printer came for his payment, the Lord had always provided us with the means.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Seeing that we were able to maintain good faith, the printer said, "No one but you church people make payments so punctually."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following the publication of the book, I prayed, "Now let Your servant depart in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the same time my disease worsened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I could not sleep peacefully at night, and when I awoke I turned incessantly from side to side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Physically, I was a bag of bones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had night sweats, and my voice became hoarse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People had trouble hearing me speak, even when they placed their ear to my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Several sisters took turns waiting upon me, one of whom was a veteran nurse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever she saw me, she would weep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She testified, "I have seen many patients, but I have never seen one whose condition was as pitiful as his.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that he can live only three or four more days."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When someone told me of this, I said, "Let this be my end. I realize I am going to die soon." One brother telegraphed the churches in various places, telling them there was no more hope for me and that they need pray for me no more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day I asked God, "Why are You calling me away so soon?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I confessed my trespasses before God, fearing that I might have been unfaithful concerning some matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time I told God that I had no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On that same day I devoted myself to fasting and praying and presented myself to Him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I told Him that I would do nothing but what He assigned me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From morning until three o'clock in the afternoon I fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time the co-workers earnestly prayed together for me in Sister Ruth Lee's home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As I prayed to God to grant me faith, He spoke His words to me, words which I could never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first sentence was, "The just shall live by faith" Rom 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second sentence was, "By faith you stand" 2 Cor 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third sentence was, "We walk by faith" 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These words filled me with great joy, for the Bible says, "All things are possible to him who believes" Mark 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I immediately thanked and praised God because He had given me His words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believed that God had cured me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The test came immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible says, "By faith you stand," but I was still lying in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A conflict arose in my mind: Should I get up and stand or remain lying down?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all know that human beings love themselves and consider it more comfortable to die in bed than to die standing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the word of God manifested its power, and ignoring all else, I put on my clothing, clothing which I had not worn for a hundred and seventy-six days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As I left the bed to stand, I perspired so profusely that it was as though I had been soaked through with rain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan said to me, "Are you trying to stand when you can't even sit up?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I retorted, "God told me to stand," and I rose to my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being again in a cold sweat, I nearly fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I kept repeating, "Stand by faith, stand by faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I then walked a few steps to get my trousers and socks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After putting on my trousers, I sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No sooner was I seated than the word of God came to me that I should not only stand by faith but also walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I felt that the ability to rise and walk a few steps to get my trousers and socks was already something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How could I expect to walk further?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Where do You want me to go?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I asked God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He answered, "Go downstairs to Sister Lee's home at number 215."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A number of brothers and sisters had been fasting and praying for me there for two or three days.</S>
