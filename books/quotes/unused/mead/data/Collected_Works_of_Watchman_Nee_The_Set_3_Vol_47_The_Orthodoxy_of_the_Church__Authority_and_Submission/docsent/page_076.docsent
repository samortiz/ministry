   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE CHARACTER OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GRACIOUS TO OTHERS Scripture Reading: Num 16 HOW MOSES DEALT WITH REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No rebellion among the children of Israel was as great as the one recorded in Numbers 16.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Korah of the tribe of Levi took the lead, joining himself with Dathan and Abiram of the tribe of Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, 250 of the leaders of the assembly joined them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They gathered themselves together and spoke strong words against Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was a great rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reviling in Numbers 12 was confined to Aaron and Miriam, and was merely a murmuring behind the back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the rebellion in chapter sixteen was corporate, and it was directly against Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rebels said, "You have gone too far!...Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?" v. 3 . Their charges were serious and severe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should pay attention to 1 the condition of Moses, that is, his attitude, and 2 the way he dealt with the situation, that is, his answer to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Reaction Falling on His Face</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 4 says that Moses' first reaction was to fall on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the proper attitude of God's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of the rebellious ones were standing when they spoke; only Moses fell down on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see a man who had touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was indeed meek; he did not have any feeling of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not vindicate himself or argue.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first thing he did was fall on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verses 5 through 7 he seemed to be saying, "Jehovah will make known who is His, who is holy, and whom He will choose, and He will cause him to come near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for us to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the morning we will all know.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I dare not say anything for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will show us clearly who is His.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it turns out to be you, that is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If it turns out to be me, that is also fine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let God decide.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not have to decide anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Tomorrow we will all come before the Lord and be tested by the censers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let the Lord decide who is the one; we do not have to fight for it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will choose who is His.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us come to God and be open to His speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses spoke these words meekly while he was falling on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the last few sentences were quite strong and serious: "You have gone too far, sons of Levi!" v. 7 . This was a sighing of grief from an elderly man who knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Israelites had been wandering in the wilderness for a long time, and they were still not in Canaan yet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moses was still hoping that they could go into Canaan; he was still hoping that he could recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Exhortation and Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 8 through 11 were Moses' words of exhortation to Korah; he was trying to recover Korah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had to deal with their accusation, which had to wait for the result of the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the meantime, he was aware of the seriousness of this matter, and he was worried about them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was not enough for him to sigh and worry; he felt that he had to exhort them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He seemed to say to Korah, "It is not a small thing for the sons of Levi to be chosen by God to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You should be content with this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why do you still want to be the priests?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you do this, you do not oppose me; you oppose the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moses was a magnanimous man, and he was confident of the things he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He knew the seriousness of this matter and he was worried about the sons of Korah.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why he exhorted them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His exhortation was not a sign of arrogance, but of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others were attacking him and giving him a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But no matter how wrong they were, he could still exhort them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a sign of a truly meek person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we allow others to continue in their mistakes, it means that our hearts are hardened and that we have no intention to recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Refusal to exhort is a sign of a lack of humility; it shows that one is proud.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Moses was rebuked, he turned around to exhort his opposers and openly deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He even gave them a night to think about it, hoping that they would repent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In dealing with the rebellious ones, Moses took care of them separately.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First he dealt with Korah the Levite and then with Dathan and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In verse 12 he sent for Dathan and Abiram to come, but they would not come, indicating that they wanted to break away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we see that even when a deputy authority is rejected, he will not want the opposing ones to break away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, he will try to recover the lost ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Dathan and Abiram said, "You have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey" v. 13 . This statement turned things around; it was exactly the opposite of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They forgot that they were making bricks in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There was no milk or honey; there was not even straw to make the bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is like bringing a young man to the Lord who then turns around and accuses you of bringing him to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is also like the ten spies who clearly saw the riches of Canaan and yet would not enter, but murmured against Moses instead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nothing more could be done except judgment when Dathan and Abiram's rebellion reached its peak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moses tried his best to recover them, but they declared twice that they would not go up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After all this, Moses gave up his hope, became angry, and went to Jehovah to settle the matter v. 15 . Then he told Korah, "You and all your company shall be present before Jehovah, you and they and Aaron, tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And let every one of you take his censer, and put incense upon it, and every one of you bring before Jehovah his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Korah's company then came before the tent of meeting, reviling Moses and Aaron again.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At this point the glory of Jehovah appeared to the whole assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God stepped forward to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Korah was the chief instigator, and the assembly followed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God was prepared to destroy not only the chief instigator but all of the assembly as well v. 21 . But Moses fell down before the Lord again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The first time Moses fell on his face before his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The second time he fell before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He prayed for the whole assembly and interceded for their safety.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God answered his prayer and ordered the assembly to depart from the tents of the wicked ones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They were of the tribe of Reuben and lived in a separate place.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since they would not come to Moses, he went to them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He ordered the assembly to depart from them, and God executed His judgment upon Korah, Dathan, and Abiram vv.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>25-33 .</S>
