<h2 class="head2">The Man-child Born</h2>
<p>Verse 5a says, &ldquo;And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&rdquo; <em>Man,</em> in <em>man-child,</em> is a meaningful and strong word. In the Scriptures, woman signifies weakness, while man signifies strength. We must keep in mind that chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen are written in a symbolic way. They are a record with signs. Thus, the woman here is not an actual woman; she is a symbol, a sign. In the same way, the man-child here is also a sign. In this picture, there is a woman, signifying something weak, out of whom comes a man-child, signifying something strong. This indicates that the man-child is the stronger part of this woman. Within the woman, the weaker part, representing all the redeemed people of God, there is a stronger part, who are the overcomers.</p>
<p>This man-child will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. Revelation 2:26-27 tells us who this one is. It says, &ldquo;And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod.&rdquo; The ones who shepherd the nations with an iron rod are the overcomers. In the first three chapters of Revelation there are the seven churches, which are weak as a whole. They are a weak woman, but the Lord calls out the overcomers from among them. The overcomers are a small number who stand up to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose when the majority of the people of God have failed Him.</p>
<p>This principle of the overcomers runs throughout all the Scriptures. At the time when Moses brought the people of Israel out of Egypt, God&rsquo;s purpose was that the entire nation of Israel would be a kingdom of priests. However, they failed God in His purpose. Only one tribe, the Levites, stood up to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. In this way they became the overcomers at that time. The people of Israel were a weak woman, and the tribe of Levi was the overcomers. In the book of Judges, all the judges such as Gideon were overcomers. The majority of God&rsquo;s people failed to carry out His purpose, so a small part stood up to be the overcomers. In the recovery of God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament time, God&rsquo;s intention was to have all His people come back from Babylon to Jerusalem. However, very few of them came back as a remnant with Ezra and Nehemiah. Those who came back to Jerusalem became the overcomers standing in the position of God&rsquo;s people to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Today it is the same. The church as a whole has failed God today in His purpose, so the Lord is calling the overcomers. A small remnant will answer the Lord&rsquo;s call to rise up and represent the church to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. These become the overcomers; in principle, they are the man-child.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">The Man-child Caught Up to God<br />
and to His Throne and the Woman Fleeing</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:5b-6 says, &ldquo;And her child was caught up to God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.&rdquo; To be caught up to God refers to the rapture. However, the place of rapture is not the place mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. This verse tells us that the majority of the church will be caught up to the air, not to the throne of God. The times of the raptures in Revelation 12 and 1 Thessalonians 4 are different, and the places to which they are raptured are also different.</p>
<p>The woman will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, that is, for three and a half years. This indicates that the overcomers will be caught up, raptured before the three and a half years. This is why we cannot accept the teachings of the pre-tribulation rapture or the post-tribulation rapture by themselves. Here is a woman, signifying the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, who brings forth a man-child, a part of the woman, who is caught up to the throne of God before the last three and a half years of this age. After the rapture of the stronger part, the main part of the woman will still remain on the earth. The proper understanding of the rapture is that there will be more than one.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 mentions another rapture, the rapture of another group of overcomers called the firstfruits (vv. 1-4). As we shall see later, these two groups of overcomers are not the same, but both groups will be raptured to the throne before the tribulation of three and a half years. In this way, a part of God&rsquo;s people will be raptured before the three and a half years, while the majority of the people of God will be left on the earth to pass through the great tribulation.</p>
