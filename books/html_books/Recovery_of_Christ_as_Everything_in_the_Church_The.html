<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Cleveland, Ohio, and Chicago, Illinois, on September 15 through 20, 1978.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST<br />
AS EVERYTHING TO US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 14:6; 15:5; Gal. 1:14-16; 2:20; 4:19; Col. 1:12, 15, 18-19, 27; 2:2-3, 8-9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; Phil. 1:21; 3:8-9; Acts 1:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SIX CRUCIAL ITEMS REVEALED<br />
IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>We need to see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is according to the Word of God. The Lord desires to recover certain things that existed in the beginning but were lost. Therefore, in order to see the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to see what there was in the beginning. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; In the beginning there was God as the Word. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; These words are simple, but they signify profound things. God is profound, the Word is difficult to define, and life is mysterious. Furthermore, we cannot logically comprehend how life can be light. We need to see the significance of the Word, God, the life, and the light.</p>
<p>In John 14:6 Christ, who is the incarnate Word, said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; We first experience Christ as our life; then He becomes the reality to us. If we do not have Christ as our life, we do not have anything real. Eventually, this reality becomes our way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST REVEALED IN GALATIANS</h2>
<p>In order to understand these matters in John, we need to go to Galatians. To see something clearly, a background is necessary to provide a contrast. Thus, to know Christ, who is the Word, God, the life, the light, the reality, and the way, we need to enter into Galatians, which presents a distinct background. The background in Galatians is religion. In 1:14 Paul said, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.&rdquo; As a young man, Paul was a leading religionist. While he was on the way to Damascus to persecute the believers, the Lord appeared to him. Paul saw not a doctrine or a teaching from man but a vision from the Lord.</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). A person was revealed into Paul&rsquo;s being. Even after being saved for years, many Christians do not have a definite realization that a person has come into them. They often think that they have received only salvation. We need to see that Christ is living as a person in us. To have food in our stomach or money in our pocket is pleasant and easy. However, to have a person who has thoughts, feelings, and activities living in us is not simple. Christ is the Word, God, the life, the light, the reality, and the way. This all-inclusive person has been revealed into every believer. He has nothing to do with religion and is even versus religion. Religion serves as a negative background in Galatians to help us see Christ.</p>
<p>Paul went on to say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith&rdquo; (2:20). Christ&rsquo;s coming into us crucifies us. After Christ comes into us, He is not passive. He never gives in. When He comes in, we have to go out. To have Christ living in us means that we are crucified with Him and that it is Christ who lives in us.</p>
<p>Paul also wrote to the Galatians, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you&rdquo; (4:19). The book of Galatians reveals that Christ is everything in the Christian life. Christ is revealed into the believers, Christ lives in them, and Christ is formed in them. This Christ is the One who is revealed in the Gospel of John as the Word, God, the life, the light, the reality, and the way. He is the One who was in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST REVEALED IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>In revealing Christ, Galatians is a continuation of John, and Colossians is a continuation of Galatians. In order to adequately know the New Testament and see a new vision of Christ, we need to put these three books together.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:12 reveals that Christ is the portion of the saints. God has allotted Christ to us as a portion. Our portion is a wonderful person who is the Word, God, the life, the light, the reality, and the way. Upon believing into Christ, we receive Him as our portion. He is revealed into us, He lives in us, and He is formed in us. As saints, we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ, our God-allotted portion.</p>
<p>Verse 15 tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God. The image is the expression. Although God is invisible, He has an expression, an image. This image is our portion; day by day we enjoy the image of God. Verse 18 reveals that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, and the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead. As the Head, the beginning, and the first item in the new creation, Christ has the first place, the preeminence, in all things. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;In Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo; Then 2:2 reveals that Christ is the mystery of God. A person who is the mystery God lives in us.</p>
<p>Because philosophy had crept into the church, Paul writes in verse 8, &ldquo;Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>philosophy</em> in this verse refers to Gnostic teaching, which included elements of Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>In verse 3 Paul says that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ. Before we were saved, we were not wise. However, once we are saved, we can experience Christ as our wisdom. All believers should be wise. This is practical. We need to experience Christ as our wisdom in how we spend our time and our money. Christ is real wisdom. When we live by Christ, He is our wisdom. We are not wise when we do not live by Christ or when Christ is unable to live in us. Christ is always in us, but we often do not allow Him to <em>live</em> in us. When Christ lives in us, He becomes our wisdom.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Verses 16 through 17 say, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe, such as life, light, air, water, and food. The physical food we eat is not the real food but only a shadow. Christ is the real food. Christ is the reality. He is the real feast, the real new moon, and the real Sabbath.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says, &ldquo;The new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The new man mentioned in verse 10 is not an individual man, for verse 11 indicates that there are many persons in the new man. The new man is a corporate man&mdash;the church. In the new man, there is no nationality, race, culture, or status, but Christ is all and in all. <em>All</em> here refers to all persons. Christ is all the members of the new man. This means that as members of the new man, we are Christ. For this reason, Paul said, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). In the church there is nothing natural but only Christ. Therefore, like Paul, we should seek to gain Christ and be found in Him (3:8-9). We need to be saved from being found in ourselves.</p>
<p>Because the church is purely Christ, the recovery of the church is simply the recovery of Christ as all in the church. In the beginning of the church there was Christ and only Christ, but this was lost. Therefore, the Lord has to come in to recover what has been lost. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ.</p>
<p>The Christ who is the many items revealed in Colossians is also our life (3:4). In this age Christ is our life, and in the coming age He will be our glory. Thus, Christ is our life for today and our hope of glory for the future (1:27).</p><h2 class="head1">MANY THINGS CREEPING IN<br />
TO REPLACE CHRIST IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the latter part of the first century, while the apostles were still on the earth, two main things crept into the church to replace Christ&mdash;Judaism and Greek philosophy. Galatians was written to deal with Judaism, and Colossians was written to deal with Greek philosophy. Since the first century, many other things have crept into the church to replace Christ. First, different doctrines came in to replace Christ. Many doctrines, including scriptural doctrines, have replaced Christ. Second, various practices, such as foot-washing, leg-lengthening, and different forms of baptism, have come in to replace Christ. Many Pentecostals may care for speaking in tongues rather than Christ. Thus, speaking in tongues has also replaced Christ. The subtlest thing that has crept in among Christians is opinions. There are endless opinions about what musical instruments to use in meetings and many other such things. Besides doctrines, practices, and opinions, there are various kinds of activities and movements that have also come in to replace Christ. Another item that has replaced Christ is organizations. Every denomination is an organization. Some denominations are organized according to certain practices or doctrines; others are organized according to a nation, such as the Church of England. These organizations replace Christ. Even Judaism and philosophy are still replacing Christ. The robes of the Catholic clergy were designed according to the Old Testament priests&rsquo; robes. This indicates a mixture with Judaism. Those in so-called modern Christianity believe in their philosophy rather than the Bible. Philosophy has replaced Christ among these groups. Judaism, philosophy, doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, and organizations have altogether replaced Christ among countless believers today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY BEING<br />
TO RECOVER CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO US</h2>
<p>Because many things have replaced Christ, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ in a full way, to recover Christ as everything to us. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations but only for Christ.</p>
<p>For example, our way to preach the gospel should be Christ. In John 15:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches.&rdquo; The proper way for the branches to bear fruit is simply to live the vine, to grow the vine, and to produce the vine. There is no need for gimmicks or worldly activities to contact people for the gospel. The Lord also said, &ldquo;I am the way&rdquo; (14:6). The way to preach the gospel is Christ. As branches in the vine, we need only to love the Lord, live Him, grow Him, and produce Him in our daily life. If we do, we will be a living testimony to our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates. When one of them becomes sick, loses his job, or experiences some other difficult situation, he may remember us and ask us to visit him. After we speak only a few words of the gospel, he may be willing to pray to receive the Lord. In this way we live the gospel by living Christ. We do not need movements, activities, or gimmicks to try to bring people to the Lord. The proper way to preach the gospel is by living Christ. This is the original way that needs to be recovered today.</p>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord charges us to be His witnesses. Our commission is not merely to preach but to be witnesses. We need to be witnesses of Christ by daily living Christ. To be a witness by living Christ is to take Christ as the way to preach the gospel. We will see a wonderful result if we are a living testimony. Our relatives and acquaintances may outwardly criticize and even despise us, but their conscience will inwardly testify on our behalf. When the time comes according to the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement, one by one they will gradually turn to Him.</p>
<p>Christ is everything in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations. We care for Christ and Christ alone. He is our life, our reality, and our way in everything. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST AS LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 29; 12:24; 14:16-17; 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 3:16-17, 19; 1 Cor. 12:12-13</h1>
<p>Christ, who is the focus of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, said that He is the way, the reality, and the life (John 14:6). Before becoming our reality or our way, Christ must first be our life. In this chapter we will consider how Christ can be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING<br />
THE LAMB OF GOD FOR REDEMPTION<br />
AND THE GRAIN OF WHEAT FOR REPRODUCTION</h2>
<p>First, we need to see who Christ is. John 1:1 says that in the beginning Christ, as the Word, was God. Verse 14 says that one day this Word became flesh. This means that God Himself was incarnated to be the man Jesus. God in Christ became a man to accomplish redemption. Thus, verse 29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; In order for Christ to be our life, He first needed to solve the problem of our sin, which separates us from God. Therefore, He became a man to be our Redeemer. As the Lamb of God, He shed His blood for the forgiveness of our sins; He accomplished redemption on the cross.</p>
<p>John 12:24 says, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; Christ came as the Lamb of God for the shedding of His blood to accomplish redemption; He came as the grain of wheat for the imparting of His life to make us His reproduction. As a grain of wheat, Christ was reproduced to become many grains through death and resurrection. The one grain is now the many grains. As the many grains, we are the reproduction of Christ. This is a crucial item of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Although this item is emphatically revealed in the Scripture, it has been lost in today&rsquo;s Christianity. Most Christians know that Christ is the Lamb of God, but few see that He is a grain of wheat. As a young person, I was convicted of my sins, and I repented and confessed to the Lord and was washed by His blood. However, when I asked how I should go on, I was told only to behave properly. Christ being the grain of wheat for life-impartation to make us His reproduction is a crucial and precious truth that has been almost entirely lost in Christianity. Because of this great lack among Christians, there is the need of recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of Reality</h2>
<p>In 14:16 and 17 Christ said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.&rdquo; Christ was the first Comforter; the second Comforter is the Spirit of reality. However, the Spirit of reality is not another person apart from Christ. The title <em>the Spirit of reality</em> indicates that whatever Christ is, is fully realized in this Spirit. In other words, the Spirit is the reality of Christ. Without the Spirit of reality, Christ could not be real to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>When Christ resurrected, He immediately became the life-giving Spirit. We need to see that Christ took two steps, indicated by two occurrences of the word <em>became</em> in the New Testament. John 1:14 says that Christ as the Word became flesh. Then 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Christ as God took a step to become a man in the flesh to accomplish redemption. After accomplishing redemption, He took another step by resurrecting to become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Some oppose the truth that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, saying that it is a heresy to say that Christ, who is the Son of God, is the Spirit. Nevertheless, this is what the Bible clearly reveals in 1 Corinthians 15:45. Although the indefinite article <em>a</em> occurs before the title <em>life-giving Spirit</em> in this verse, there is surely only one Spirit in the universe who can give <em>zoe,</em> the eternal, divine life. Whether or not we understand this, the Bible reveals that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Darby&rsquo;s New Translation places verses 7 through 16 within parentheses, indicating that verse 17 is a direct continuation of verse 6. The end of verse 6 says, &ldquo;The Spirit gives life.&rdquo; Therefore, the Lord is the Spirit who gives life. The Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit</h2>
<p>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; As a young believer, I was troubled that this verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet.&rdquo; I even thought that this might be a mistake, because I knew that the Spirit of God was mentioned as early as Genesis 1:2. Then one day I read the book <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> by Andrew Murray. In chapter 5, entitled &ldquo;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus,&rdquo; Murray says that before Jesus&rsquo; resurrection the Spirit of God had divinity but not humanity. The humanity of Jesus was added to the Spirit of God in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Therefore, this Spirit who possesses both divinity and humanity was not yet before Jesus was glorified in resurrection. The Spirit of God existed before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, but the Spirit that includes Christ&rsquo;s humanity was not yet. In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection His humanity was added to the Spirit of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Compound Spirit</h2>
<p>The picture of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 shows that besides the humanity of Christ, His death and His resurrection have also been added to the Spirit. Olive oil, which typifies the Spirit, was compounded with four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. According to typology, myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the death of Christ. Calamus, a reed that shoots up from marshy ground, is a picture of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Finally, cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, which repels Satan and the demons. The olive oil being compounded with these four spices typifies the Spirit of God being compounded with Christ&rsquo;s death, the sweetness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. Today the Spirit of Christ is the compound Spirit, possessing both divinity and humanity. The Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, the resurrected Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being with Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; If the Lord were not the Spirit, He would have no way to be with our spirit. The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our regenerated spirit. We need to see the vision that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit. This matter was lost, but it has been recovered among us. Instead of discussing doctrines or practices, we simply need to enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to have a proper Christian living and church life, we need to enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit. We will be satisfied by Christ as the life-giving Spirit and will not be tempted to seek after worldly entertainment. Instead of forbidding our young people from participating in worldly activities, we should minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit to them. Nothing is more enjoyable than Christ. We need to partake of Him and minister Him one to another. When we are fully enjoying the all-inclusive Christ in the church life, we will not be distracted by the world. People seek worldly amusement when they do not have Christ as their joy. Christ is completely satisfying. The content of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not any outward practices; rather, the content is Christ, who is our unique joy and entertainment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being One Spirit with the Lord</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; It is a wonderful fact that we are one spirit with the Lord. If we realize that we are one spirit with the Lord and declare this fact, our daily living will be uplifted. It is our being one spirit with the Lord that makes us saints. The authority and impact of our Christian life and work are based on the fact that we are one spirit with the Lord. Because this item has been missed in today&rsquo;s Christianity, it needs to be recovered in our knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br />
IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:16-17 Paul prays, &ldquo;That He [the Father] would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; The inner man is our regenerated spirit. When we were regenerated, Christ came into our spirit. Now He desires to spread out into our heart, which is composed of our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Our spirit may be likened to the living room in a home, and our mind, emotion, and will may be likened to the inner chambers. Christ desires to spread into and settle down in these inner chambers. We need to pray, &ldquo;Father, strengthen me into my spirit that Christ may settle down in my heart, spreading into my mind, emotion, and will.&rdquo; For Christ to make His home in our heart is for Him to take over and possess every part of our inner being. It is to have our inner being saturated and permeated with Christ until every part becomes Christ. This is another item that needs to be recovered today.</p>
<p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; When Christ spreads into every part of our inner being to make His home in our heart, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. Our content will not be common, worldly things but will be the fullness of God. This will issue in a wonderful church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; This verse shows that the church as the Body of Christ is the corporate Christ. Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; Because we have been baptized into the corporate Christ in one Spirit, we are now positioned to drink of the Spirit. We have been put into Christ by being baptized into Him, and now we are taking Christ into us by drinking Him as the Spirit. In this way we are being mingled with Christ, who is the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of movements, activities, opinions, concepts, or gimmicks; instead, Christ is our all in all. We are in Him because we have been baptized into Him, and now He is filling us as we are drinking of Him. This is the church life, and this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. This vision of Christ being everything to us will rescue us from any kind of distraction. We need to drop all our concepts, opinions, and ways, and care only for Christ as our all in all.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST AS THE REALITY<br />
AS REVEALED IN 1 CORINTHIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:22-24, 30; 2:9-10; 3:11; 5:7-8; 10:3-4; 11:3; 12:12; 15:20, 47, 45; 6:17</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider our experience of Christ as the reality as revealed in 1 Corinthians. This Epistle addresses many problems in the church life. The unique solution to these problems is Christ as the reality. Problems in the church life may be likened to physical illnesses that may occur when a person does not eat the proper food for a period of time. The way to solve such problems is to eat nourishing food. Christ is our rich food. Problems arise when the church lacks Christ. To save the church from problems, we need the rich experience and enjoyment of Christ. In 1 Corinthians Christ is presented as at least eighteen items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE POWER OF GOD<br />
AND THE WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 Paul says, &ldquo;Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; Religious people, such as the Jews, desire to see signs. Philosophical people, such as the Greeks, prefer to exercise their mind to obtain wisdom. Miraculous signs require power, and philosophy requires wisdom. Christ is both power and wisdom to us.</p>
<p>In order to run a corporation, both power and wisdom are needed. If a businessman has the capital, he has the financial power to start a corporation, but without the necessary wisdom he will lose everything. Our life may be likened to a corporation. Christ is our spiritual capital; He is the power we need. Christ is also the wisdom; He is our way. The power and wisdom we need to live our life is Christ.</p>
<p>Without wisdom, our way to do anything is not excellent. The excellent way is produced from wisdom. Cleverness is not the same as wisdom. Whereas cleverness is superficial and comes mainly from the human mind, wisdom comes from God and is higher than human cleverness. We need Christ as our power and our wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Verse 30 says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; We are in Christ because we have been baptized into Him. Christ is a sphere, a realm, and a kind of situation or condition into which we have been baptized. Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 both show that when we are baptized into the water, we are baptized into Christ. The water of baptism signifies not only the death of Christ but also Christ Himself. Christ, into whom we have been baptized, became wisdom to us from God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Righteousness</h2>
<p>To be righteous is to do things in the way that God has ordained. Whatever God does is not only righteous but also righteousness. Righteousness means to be right with God and with man. The only one who can be righteous is Christ. Therefore, He is the power for us to be righteous. Christ is also the wisdom, the way, to be righteous. With Christ, we have both the power and the wisdom to be right with God and with man. Before we were saved, we were unrighteous, but when we received the Lord, we received the power and the wisdom to live righteously. There is no need for someone to teach us, for Christ speaks to us from within.</p>
<p>When I became a believer as a young person, my living spontaneously changed. Before my younger brother and I were saved as teenagers, our mother could not control us. We were like two wild horses. After we were saved, however, we loved to read the Bible and pray. The horses became lambs. Our mother was shocked and wondered what had happened to us. Christ as the power and the wisdom of God entered into our being. We did not need anyone to teach us, because we had Christ in us as the power and the wisdom to behave properly. Many saints have a similar testimony. Others, especially our parents, may wonder what causes this great change in our living since we are not outwardly taught or regulated. The change in our living is a result not of religion but of our receiving Christ, a living person, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God. This person is righteousness. Therefore, after receiving Him, we spontaneously become righteous. Once we receive the Lord, we have Him within us as the power and the wisdom to behave in a proper way and are thus spontaneously righteous in everything. We are right with God, our parents, our siblings, and everyone. When Christ is the reality of our life, our life is a righteous life.</p><h2 class="head2">Sanctification</h2>
<p>Sanctification is closely related to holiness. Holiness is objective and refers to God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s doings are righteousness, and His nature is holiness. When objective holiness becomes our subjective experience, it is sanctification. Holiness is an objective nature, and sanctification is a subjective experience. To be sanctified is to have God&rsquo;s nature and to be separated unto God from anything other than God. Our living may be righteous but not yet sanctified, for we may be right with God and with man but still not separated unto God. As we grow in Christ, our life will first become righteous, and it will eventually become sanctified.</p>
<p>A young sister may have been dishonest before she was saved. Perhaps she took something from a department store without paying for it. This may have even become a habit of hers. After she is saved, however, she stops stealing and becomes completely honest. This is righteousness; it is Christ within her as the power and the wisdom of God. After a period of time, when she goes to the department store, the Lord may inwardly bother her when she considers buying a certain item. Something within tells her that it is not holy. Although she would be acting righteously by purchasing the item rather than stealing it, Christ within her as sanctification convicts her that it is a worldly item. This illustrates the difference between righteousness and sanctification. We enjoy Christ as power and wisdom not only for righteousness but also for sanctification. In this way we become righteous and sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redemption</h2>
<p>We need to be not only righteous and sanctified but also redeemed. Redemption is necessary because we were created as God&rsquo;s possession, but we were lost in the fall. Therefore, God had to redeem us. On the one hand, our redemption was once for all in a general way when we first believed in the Lord Jesus. On the other hand, because we were all born in a completely fallen condition, we still need to be redeemed in all the areas of our being, including our mind, emotion, and will. Our every thought needs to be redeemed. Although I have been saved for over half a century, even today I still need to be redeemed in some areas.</p>
<p>Christ is the power and the wisdom for us to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed. Our life may be righteous but not fully sanctified. Our life also may be sanctified but not fully redeemed. Suppose I buy a necktie from a department store. If I pay in full, I am righteous, but if the tie is worldly, I am not sanctified. Furthermore, I may be sanctified if I buy a tie that is not worldly, but if my thoughts then become proud because my mind is natural, I still need to be redeemed in my thinking. We need to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed. These are three aspects of our Christian living.</p>
<p>Every Christian should live a life that is righteous, sanctified, and redeemed. Even if we are righteous and sanctified, we still need to be redeemed. For instance, we may love others in a natural way. We may be kind to our neighbors but in a natural way. Because we have not been fully redeemed from our fallen condition, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I need You as my power and wisdom to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed. I do not want to remain in a fallen state, living naturally. I do not want to remain in Adam. God has transferred me into You, and I want to abide in You to be redeemed from my natural way of thinking, my natural way of loving others, and my natural way of making decisions. I do not want to express myself, Lord; I want to express only You. I need to be redeemed from my natural attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several good Bible teachers have pointed out that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer to three stages of the Christian life. First, Christ became our righteousness for our past. Now Christ is sanctification for our present living. In the future, when Christ comes, our body will be redeemed. I agree with this, but I believe that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are also three aspects of our daily Christian life. Every day we need Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Day by day Christ is the power and the wisdom for us to have such a proper Christian living that is righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE DEPTHS OF GOD</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:9-10 Paul says, &ldquo;As it is written, &lsquo;Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man&rsquo;s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.&rsquo; But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&rdquo; Christ is the depths, or the deep things, of God. Everything in human society is superficial. However, we enjoy something deep&mdash;Christ as the deep things of God. Christ is deeper than scientific knowledge; He is the deepest thing. Unbelievers may have education and wealth, but these things are shallow. As those who love the Lord, we enjoy something deeper. Our joy and our inner strength are deep. We are often a mystery to our unsaved friends and relatives because we have something within that is deep. It is easy to see what unbelievers have, because it is superficial, but what we have is mysterious because it is deep. They may wonder why we are joyful when we are outwardly suffering loss. We are joyful because we have Christ, the depths of God.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the foundation of the church, and He should also be the foundation of our life. If we do not have Christ, our life has no foundation. When we receive Christ, take Him as our person, and begin to live Him, we have a foundation. Our life is founded on Christ. This should be our daily experience. Whatever we do and the way we live should be altogether founded on Christ. When Christ is our foundation, He is the reality of our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR PASSOVER<br />
AND OUR FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 5:7 says, &ldquo;Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.&rdquo; We were formerly under God&rsquo;s condemnation, but Christ became our Passover so that God would forgive us and so that His condemnation would pass over us. Christ being our Passover indicates that through Him we have received salvation and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&rdquo; In the Old Testament the first of the seven feasts of the children of Israel was the Passover feast. Immediately following the Passover there was the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which lasted seven days. In this feast there was nothing leavened, signifying that there was nothing sinful, dirty, or condemned by God. We enjoy Christ as our unleavened bread. The Feast of Unleavened Bread lasting seven days indicates that every day of our Christian life is a feast and that we are in this feast our whole life. If we do not sense that we are enjoying a feast, it is because we have not purged out the leaven, the sin of our old nature. If we hate this leaven and purge it out, our Christian life will spontaneously become a feast, a sweet enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s table signifies both the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Lord&rsquo;s table declares that sin is over and Christ has come. It indicates that we do not have any condemnation and that instead we have enjoyment. Now we are in a feast enjoying Christ, but we must hate sin and deal with it to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE SPIRITUAL FOOD,<br />
THE SPIRITUAL DRINK, AND THE SPIRITUAL ROCK</h2>
<p>In 10:3 and 4 we see Christ as our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our spiritual rock. Christ is the manna, and He is the living water that flows out of the cleft rock. Today our daily food and drink are Christ. The living water flowing out of the rock indicates that the rock is the source of supply. This source always follows us and supplies us with our daily need. Our supply is Christ, and our source of supply is also Christ. This source being a rock signifies that Christ is altogether dependable; we can rely on Him. Christ is our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our reliable source of supply, which always follows us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE HEAD AND THE BODY</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:3 reveals that Christ is the Head, and 12:12 reveals that He is also the Body. Christ is both the Head and the Body, the church. Therefore, in the church there is no natural person, but Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTFRUITS, THE SECOND MAN, THE LAST ADAM, AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15 reveals four more aspects of Christ&mdash;the firstfruits (v. 20), the second man (v. 47), the last Adam (v. 45), and the life-giving Spirit (v. 45). Thus, Christ is first, second, and last. This indicates that Christ is every positive thing in the universe. Furthermore, He is the life-giving Spirit. This is the key to all the foregoing seventeen items. God&rsquo;s power, God&rsquo;s wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, the depths of God, our foundation, the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, our rock, the Head, the Body, the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam are all in the life-giving Spirit. If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, He would have nothing to do with us. If He were not the life-giving Spirit, He could not be the power of God or any of the other items to us. Our experience of Christ depends entirely upon His being the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 gives us the way to experience and enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit. This verse says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we are joined to Him as one spirit. Christ is the reality of every positive thing, including the many items revealed in 1 Corinthians. Furthermore, because He is now the life-giving Spirit and we are one spirit with Him, everything He is can be real to us and is ours. We should not remain in our mind, emotion, or will. Rather, we need to turn to our spirit. Instead of caring for our thoughts, our love, our hatred, or our decisions, we need to constantly turn to our spirit, where Christ is. When we turn to our spirit, we meet Christ and give Him the way to spread from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will. Then Christ will be able to settle Himself in our inner being to make His home in our heart, thereby becoming our all in all. We will have the reality and will no longer be empty. Christ is not only our life but also our reality. When Christ is our reality, He becomes our way, the way for us to live in the presence of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST BEING THE WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:6; Heb. 10:19-20; Matt. 3:13-17; 1 Cor. 1:22-24; 2:1-4; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Phil. 3:10-11</h1>
<p>Christ said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life&rdquo; (John 14:6). In the two preceding chapters we saw how Christ becomes life and reality to us. In this chapter we come to Christ being the way. Christ first becomes life to us, then reality, and lastly the way. We must have Christ as our life in order to participate in Him as our reality. When we have Him as our reality, this reality becomes our way. The way to live the Christian life is a person, the all-inclusive Christ. He is our way to contact and serve God, fellowship with other believers, live the church life, preach the gospel, and shepherd the saints.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians Paul twice mentions Christ crucified. In 1:22 through 24 he says, &ldquo;Indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; In the previous chapter we saw that Christ becomes the reality of all things to us by being the power and the wisdom of God. Now we need to see that this One who is the power and the wisdom of God to us is Christ crucified. The crucified Christ is the way.</p>
<p>In 2:1 through 4 Paul says, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God. For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&rdquo; Paul spoke not from his eloquence, keen mind, or burning emotion but from his spirit. His natural being, including his mind and emotion, was crucified with Christ. Because Paul preached only Christ crucified, he had the attitude of one who was crucified. He was with the saints not in his mind but in weakness, fear, and much trembling. His speech was in demonstration of the Spirit. Paul&rsquo;s example shows the crucified Christ as the way to minister life to others. The way to preach the word is not an exalted way but a crucified way. To rely on human capacity, eloquence, or charisma is to not take the crucified way. The proper way to preach the gospel and minister life to people is the crucified way&mdash;the way that puts us to death. This way is a person&mdash;the crucified Christ.</p>
<p>The crucified Christ is not only the way to preach the word but also the way to live. In order to live, we must die. The way to live is to die. If we do not know how to die, we do not know how to live. When young saints ask me how to help others, I say, &ldquo;The way to help others is to die.&rdquo; Some young husbands have asked me how they can properly love their wives. I say, &ldquo;You have to die. When you die, you are able to love.&rdquo; The way to love our spouse is the crucified Christ. A number of times young wives have asked me how to submit to their husbands. They feel that they are able to submit to the Lord and to the church, but it is very difficult for them to submit to their husbands. I tell them, &ldquo;You have to die. The way is to die.&rdquo; After listening to this answer, most ask, &ldquo;How can I die?&rdquo; It is indeed difficult to die. To live is easy; to die is hard. Although we cannot make ourselves die, within us we have the crucified Christ, who is dying all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEGINNING HIS MINISTRY<br />
BY BEING BURIED THROUGH BAPTISM<br />
AND CONTINUING HIS MINISTRY<br />
BY LIVING A CRUCIFIED LIFE</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came out to minister at thirty years of age, He first went to John the Baptist to be buried through baptism (Matt. 3:13). Only one who has died and been buried is qualified to touch the ministry of God. Even the Lord Jesus, who was holy, pure, sinless, and perfect, had to die and be buried before touching God&rsquo;s ministry. John the Baptist thought that only the sinners needed to be baptized. According to his natural concept, because Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit and was therefore holy, sinless, and perfect, He did not need to be buried but could enter directly into God&rsquo;s ministry. However, the Lord Jesus knew that no person should touch God&rsquo;s ministry without having his human nature buried. Therefore, He came to be baptized by John.</p>
<p>When John tried to prevent the Lord from being baptized, the Lord told John, &ldquo;Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). In the previous chapter we saw that righteousness is to be right with God and man. The highest righteousness is to die and be buried. In order to properly love our spouse, we need to die and be buried. In relating to our spouse, our children, or anyone, the best righteousness is to die and be buried. As long as we are alive, we make trouble for those around us. However, if we die and are buried, we will no longer cause problems for anyone. When we die, our spouse will be at peace, and our home will be calm. The most righteous thing is to die and be buried. When we die and are buried, we are completely righteous before God and man.</p>
<p>When the Lord came out to touch the ministry of God, the first thing He did was to hand Himself over to die and be buried in baptism. Immediately after He went up from the water, the heavens were opened to Him, the Spirit descended upon Him, and the Father spoke (vv. 16-17). These three things signify the enjoyment of the presence of God. The way to enter into the enjoyment of the presence of God is by dying and being buried.</p>
<p>Not only was the Lord put into death when He was baptized, but the four Gospels reveal that His living on the earth was also continually under death. In one sense, after being immersed in baptism, the Lord rose up from the death water. Yet in another sense, He remained under death in His living and walk. Jesus was dying to live. For the entire three and a half years of His earthly ministry, He was dying. In other words, He was always being crucified. Eventually, at the end of the three and a half years of His ministry, He walked to the cross to die physically. <em>Hymns,</em> #481 by A. B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, says, &ldquo;All the way to Calvary.&rdquo; Jesus was going all the way to Calvary during the entire three and a half years of His ministry on the earth. His way to the cross on Calvary began from His baptism. His baptism was His first step on the way to the cross. He always lived by dying. The Lord was powerful, victorious, and full of life because He was dying all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT CONTAINING THE KILLING<br />
OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Before His resurrection, such a Spirit was not yet (John 7:39). The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6, 17). Now the Spirit of God has been compounded, as typified by the compounding of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:22-33. When the tabernacle was built, God commanded that a hin of pure olive oil, typifying the Spirit of God, be compounded with four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These spices signify, respectively, Christ&rsquo;s death, the sweetness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. This type was fulfilled when the Spirit of God was compounded with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and His death and resurrection were compounded into the Spirit. Ingredients such as tea, milk, lemon, and honey may be added to a glass of water. When we take in such a drink, we receive not only the water but also all the other ingredients along with their benefits. Likewise, when we drink the Spirit today, we receive not only the Spirit but also the death and the resurrection of Christ. These elements have been mingled into the compound Spirit, who is the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Today the Spirit who indwells our spirit is a killing One because He has been compounded with the death of Christ and its effectiveness. There is killing in the life-giving Spirit. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we experience killing from within. Immediately after calling on the Lord, we may sense that we have been wrong in our conduct or attitude toward our husband or wife. This is a killing. The life-giving Spirit is also the germ-killing Spirit. When we are wrong, rather than hearing an admonishing or rebuking word from someone, we simply need to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; The more we call, the more the negative elements within us are killed.</p>
<p>A medical doctor who knows that his patient is sick from certain germs will be at peace once he has given his patient the right antibiotic. The doctor knows that when the antibiotic has been taken, the germs will be killed. In the same way, as long as I minister the crucified Christ into the saints, I am fully at peace. My ministry may be likened to a medical treatment. After the last message in a conference is given, I am at peace because I have the full assurance that I have passed on the necessary antibiotic&mdash;Christ crucified.</p>
<p>There is not much recorded of the Lord&rsquo;s first thirty years on the earth, but we have the full record of His last three and a half years. In those three and a half years He constantly walked, lived, moved, and worked under death. The first step was baptism; the last step was the cross. He was crucified to live. If Christ had not died, He could not have resurrected. Death being the threshold of resurrection is a great principle. Christ&rsquo;s death ushered Him into resurrection. His dying to be resurrected was His dying to live. Without death He could not have resurrected. Death brings in resurrection.</p>
<p>Today we too need to die to live. We have a dying Christ within us, and this dying Christ is the ingredients of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is constituted with the death of Christ and the resurrected Christ. We do not need to make ourselves die, because we have a dying One within us. We do not need to kill our own &ldquo;germs,&rdquo; because we have the antibiotics to do the work. This is the crucified Christ as the way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST BEING A NEW AND LIVING WAY</h2>
<p>The crucified Christ being the way is further revealed in Hebrews 10:19-20, which says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; A new and living way has been opened by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. He was crucified to rend the veil that separates man from God. The way has been opened by Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. Therefore, the crucified Christ is the way.</p>
<p>To take Christ as our way in everything, we need to die with Him. In order to shepherd the saints or be a good elder, brother, sister, husband, wife, father, or mother, we do not need to learn certain steps. The way is simply to die with Christ. The way of the Christian life is the crucified Christ.</p>
<p>Christ crucified is the way of my ministry. When I die with Him, I have much to minister. I have learned this secret. Whenever I need to speak, I go to the cross. Then I receive a word from the Lord. A word from the crucified Christ is a word in resurrection, and a word in resurrection is boundless. If we have merely learned something of dead letters, after we speak it, that is the end of it. But if we go to the cross and are willing to die there, our speaking will be in resurrection. Christ crucified is the way of our ministry.</p>
<p>Before a recent turmoil among the local churches, I saw signs of rebellion and signs that the churches were deviating from the way of life. At that time I went to the Lord, and the Lord told me not to do anything outwardly or make an issue of anything but to go to the cross. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace I went to the cross. By going to the cross, a living word came. Many messages came by my going to the cross. Now I would never leave the cross. Many things have tempted me to leave the cross, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I have been preserved on the cross. The more I remain on the cross, the more the messages come. The crucified Christ is the way to carry out the ministry.</p>
<p>In our daily Christian walk the crucified Christ is the prevailing way. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:10-12, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; The putting to death of Jesus is the way of our daily walk. If we are identified with the crucified Christ, He becomes our way&mdash;our way to live the Christian life, to worship God, to enter into God&rsquo;s presence, to take care of the church, to shepherd the saints, to preach the gospel, and to be a proper husband, wife, son, or daughter. The crucified Christ is the way to do everything in the Christian life.</p>
<p>The Christ who said that He is the way (John 14:6) constantly lived under death throughout the three and a half years of His earthly ministry. From the first step of His baptism to the last step of the cross, Christ was crucified all the way to Calvary. It is as such a crucified One that He is the way. The way for us to live the Christian life today is to die with Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLE REVEALING<br />
THE WAY OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The arrangement of the tabernacle and its furniture in the Old Testament is a picture showing how we as saved sinners can enter into God&rsquo;s presence to enjoy God as our everything. Within the Holy of Holies, in the center of the tabernacle, was the Ark (Exo. 40:2-3, 20-21). Upon the Ark was the expiation cover, signifying the throne of grace, where God met and spoke with His people (25:10-22; Heb. 4:16). In front of the Ark, at the entrance to the Holy of Holies in the Holy Place, was the incense altar, the place to which the saved sinners in type could come (Exo. 30:1-10). God met with His people from above the Ark, and the sinners came to the incense altar facing the Ark to hear God speak. In the Holy Place on the north side was the table of the bread of the Presence, and on the south side was the lampstand (25:23-40; 26:35). The table ministered the life supply, and the lampstand gave the light. Outside the Holy Place in the outer court was the laver (30:17-21), and before the laver was the altar of burnt offering (27:1-8; Heb. 13:10), which signifies the cross. All these items in the tabernacle were arranged in the shape of a cross.</p>
<p>When we, as unbelievers, were in the world, we were outside the realm of God&rsquo;s grace, outside the realm of the cross. But one day we heard the gospel, answered the call, and, in type, entered the gate of the tabernacle. We came to the cross, repented, confessed our sins, and received the Lord Jesus. We were saved, and the blood of Christ washed our sins. This occurred in type at the altar of burnt offering. From the altar we went on to the laver, where the Spirit washed away the dirt of the world. From there we went to the table of the bread of the Presence to receive nourishment and to the lampstand to receive light. Afterward, we proceeded to the incense altar to offer prayers as a sweet-smelling savor to God. Then we entered into the presence of our God to enjoy Him. This is the way of the cross.</p>
<p>At the burnt offering altar our sins are washed away, and in the laver the world is cleansed away. Then we come to the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. At the incense altar there is a veil that separates man from God. According to Hebrews 10:20, this veil typifies the flesh. The death of Christ caused this veil to be split from top to bottom (Matt. 27:51). After we are cleansed from our sins and the world, and the flesh is dealt with, there is nothing more to frustrate our enjoying the presence of God&mdash;there is no more separation. Through the cross we enter into the presence of God to enjoy all that God is. Thus, the cross is the way.</p>
<p>The whole tabernacle is a type of Christ (John 1:14). Thus, the tabernacle being arranged in the shape of a cross signifies that Christ lived entirely under the cross. This crucified Christ is our way. We need to be crossed out. Under the working of the cross, we enjoy the cleansing of the altar of the burnt offering, the washing of the laver, the food supply of the table of the bread of the Presence, the enlightening of the lampstand, and the sweet-smelling savor of the incense altar. In this way we enter into the presence of God and enjoy all that God is to us. The way of the cross is the way to the Father, the way to the enjoyment of the presence of God. It is also the way to live our Christian life, family life, and church life. The crucified Christ is our way in everything. By and with the indwelling, crucified Christ, we can die to live every day.</p>
<p>Romans 6:3 says, &ldquo;All of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death,&rdquo; and Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; We were baptized into the death of Christ once for all at the beginning of our Christian life. Now we are continuously being conformed to His death; this is the continuation of the Christian life. According to the arrangement of the tabernacle, as soon as we enter into the realm of the Christian life, we are being conformed to the cross. Our entire Christian life is the way to Calvary. When we are on this way, we are being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. This is what it means for Christ to be our way. If we are conformed to His death, we will attain to the out-resurrection from the dead (v. 11). The more we are conformed to His death, the more we will attain to the extraordinary resurrection.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 11:3; 12:28; Matt. 20:25-28; 23:8, 10; 1 Pet. 5:3; Heb. 13:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING QUALIFIED TO BE MADE<br />
HEAD OVER ALL THINGS<br />
AFTER HE FULFILLED GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE<br />
AND DEFEATED GOD&rsquo;S ENEMY AS A MAN</h2>
<p>In Old Testament times the headship of Christ was not completed, because Christ had not yet become a man. As God alone, He was not qualified to be the Head. Christ had to accomplish two things as a man before He could be made Head over all things. First, God needed a man to fulfill His eternal purpose, which is for man to be one with God for His expression. Christ carried out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose not as the Son of God but as the Son of Man, because God&rsquo;s purpose concerns humanity.</p>
<p>God also needed a man to defeat Satan, who was created by God to be the archangel but who rebelled and became God&rsquo;s enemy. As the Creator, God would never lower Himself to deal with one of His creatures. Therefore, He needed another creature, man, to deal with His enemy. When Christ came, the devil knew that Christ was the Son of God coming as the Son of Man in order to bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). Therefore, when the devil tempted the Lord, the devil tried his best to cause the Lord to leave His standing as a man, saying to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3). The Lord answered, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone&rdquo; (v. 4). He did not leave His standing as man. Christ came as a man to deal with Satan. Hebrews 2:14 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo; Thus, Christ accomplished two things as a man: He fulfilled God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and He destroyed God&rsquo;s enemy. By accomplishing these two things, Christ was qualified to be the Head.</p>
<p>According to Acts 2:36, in Christ&rsquo;s ascension God inaugurated Him into the headship. After Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and destroyed God&rsquo;s enemy through His incarnation and crucifixion, He resurrected and ascended to the heavens. In His ascension God gave Him to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). Because Christ carried out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and defeated God&rsquo;s enemy as a man, He is fully qualified to be Head over all things. As the enthroned Head today, He is still a man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO PRACTICE THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES</h2>
<p>The headship of Christ should be more than a doctrine to us. In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Paul says, &ldquo;I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man.&rdquo; In our daily life we need to consider that Christ is our Head. When we do not take Christ as our Head, the self is our head. Although some Christians regard Christ as their life, few regard Him as their Head. However, if we do not realize that Christ is our Head and practice the headship of Christ, it is difficult to take Him as our life. The headship of Christ is a crucial matter that affects our personal life, family life, daily life, and church life. In order to have all the areas of our life fully attuned to the proper, normal way, we must see that Christ is our Head and practice the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>There are many opportunities to practice the headship of Christ in our daily life. To fellowship is wonderful, but we often insult the headship of Christ in our fellowship. Suppose a young brother fellowships with another brother about where he should go to school. In most cases, when a saint comes to a brother asking for fellowship, the brother will immediately begin to give his opinion. This kind of conversation is not fellowship but rather merely a secular conversation. Brothers in such a situation need to realize that neither one of them is the head but that Christ is the unique Head. They should fellowship in a way that honors His headship. No matter what our fellowship concerns, we need to regard the headship of Christ, giving Him the full honor.</p>
<p>The angels and the demons are watching to see whether we honor the headship of Christ. Regrettably, in our consideration of any matter, we usually fail to recognize that Christ is our Head. Before we begin to consider anything, we first need to recognize the headship of Christ. If two brothers who are talking about a matter have been enlightened to see the headship of Christ, their conversation will occur not in a secular way but in a heavenly way, under the headship of Christ. The brother initiating the fellowship should say, &ldquo;Brother, we need to consider this matter under the headship of Christ.&rdquo; Just this one sentence will transform the whole fellowship. Neither brother will dare to make a decision, because both will realize that neither one of them is the head. Since Christ is their Head, neither brother has a right to make a decision or even to propose anything. If we are enlightened, we will repent for all the times that we have disregarded our Head.</p>
<p>A married sister may know doctrinally that the husband is the head. However, if she has truly been enlightened to see that her husband is her head, when their son asks her how to decide some matter, she will turn to her husband before answering anything. This indicates that she regards his headship. On the other hand, if the sister answers before checking with her husband, she disregards his headship, for it is as if she has no head. Just as a wife may consider and even decide many things without checking with her husband, in our daily life we often do not respect Christ as our Head. We need to repent, praying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. All these years I have disregarded Your headship. I have lived in a way that does not acknowledge You as my Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a brother comes to us for fellowship, we insult the headship of Christ if we propose anything to the brother. We do not have the position to tell another brother what to do, because we are not the head. If we dare to tell a brother what to do, it indicates that we disregard the headship of Christ. If we realize that the Lord is the unique Head of the brother, we will only help the brother to realize the headship of Christ. We will not dare to propose or decide anything. We will have the burden only to help him to realize that the Lord is his Head. In doing anything, we need to realize that we are not our own head. Neither is any other saint our head. Only Christ is our Head.</p>
<p>When we fellowship, we need to help one another to honor the headship of Christ. To make the right decision in a situation is secondary; to realize the headship of Christ is primary. Once we are clear that the Lord is our Head and respect His headship, we are ready to know His will, because we have given Him the proper and necessary position. Often when we seek to know the Lord&rsquo;s will, we do not give Him the right position. For this reason, we may pray for a long time but still not know what we should do. The Lord must have the position as the Head in order to be able to make us clear. Christ is the Head, yet when we do not recognize or regard Him as the Head, we do not give Him this position. When we regard Christ as our Head, we give Him the position as the Head, and we are rightly positioned to learn His will. In a family, school, or corporation, the father, principal, or boss, respectively, would not give orders until he and the others are properly positioned. Most of us are not properly positioned in our daily lives because we do not realize that Christ is our Head. A sister cannot realize that her husband is her head until she positions herself by taking Christ as her Head. If she does not take Christ as her Head, she cannot be rightly positioned to be a proper wife. To take Christ as our Head is crucial.</p>
<p>It is only when we take Christ as our Head that we are properly positioned in the presence of God. Position is a crucial matter. What we are able to physically see depends on our physical location. No matter how hard we try to see something, we cannot see it if our position is wrong. Likewise, no amount of prayer will cause us to know God&rsquo;s will if we are not positioned under the headship of Christ. If we consider our experience carefully, we may realize that we rarely recognize Christ as our Head. The burden in this chapter is that we would see that Christ must first be our Head before He can be our life, person, reality, and way. We are short of the experience of Christ simply because our position is not proper as a result of our not regarding Christ as our Head.</p>
<p>We need to be enlightened to see that for years our position has not been right. We have not been properly positioned before God because we have not realized or regarded Christ as our Head. To change our position, we need to see our shortcoming and declare to the Lord that we recognize and take Him as our Head. This will change not only our position but also our concept concerning many things. If we take such a position, recognizing Christ as our Head, we are practicing the headship of Christ. If we practice the headship of Christ in our daily life, we will recognize that the Lord is the Head and that we have no position or right to make a decision or even propose anything. We will acknowledge that we are under Christ our Head. This is to honor and practice His headship.</p>
<p>Suppose a serving brother invites us to go with him to visit another locality. If we make a decision right away, we insult the headship of Christ. However, if we are practicing the headship of Christ, we will immediately answer, &ldquo;Brother, I have to ask the Lord.&rdquo; This is to honor the headship of Christ. If we make a decision without checking with the Lord, we assume the headship and insult the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>If we are clear that Christ is our Head, we will see that we do not have the right to make any decision, even to buy a pair of shoes. When we see that Christ is our Head, we lose all our rights. For Christ to be the Head means that we are not the head; we are only those who are under Christ. If the Lord leads us to buy a pair of shoes, we buy them. If He does not say to buy the shoes, we do not buy them. This is a matter not merely of obedience but also of honoring the headship of Christ. The Lord decides whether we should buy a pair of shoes, and He also chooses the style and the color. In one sense, this may bother us, but because we were predestinated by the Father, we truly feel happy only when we are bound by the headship of Christ. The Christian life is an extraordinary kind of life. The more we are bound, the happier we are. We need to be willing to be bound. We should not make any decisions for ourselves or for others. We need to allow Christ to make every decision for us. If we are bound by His decisions, we will be the happiest persons.</p>
<p>The first step of experiencing Christ is to recognize Him as our Head. When we take Christ as our Head, He makes every decision. It is easy to experience Christ when we take Him as our Head. When we are altogether under His headship, not only doctrinally but also experientially, and are willing to lose every right and to take His decision in everything, we will begin to experience Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE UNIQUE LEADER IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The unique leader in the church is Christ. Suppose someone asks us who the leader of our church is. If we say that Christ is the leader, the person may not understand or accept our answer. The person may ask again, &ldquo;Who is the man, woman, or group who is the leader in your church?&rdquo; We need to answer strongly that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have no leader other than Christ. We should lead such an inquiring person to Matthew 23. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ.&rdquo; We are all brothers, and there is only one Leader&mdash;Christ. We can explain, &ldquo;According to the Bible, among God&rsquo;s children today there is only one Leader&mdash;Jesus Christ. There should be no other Leader. Therefore, in our church we do not have any other leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Are the elders not leaders?&rdquo; Besides pointing out Matthew 23:8 and 10 to such ones, we should also mention Matthew 20:25-28. According to the principle in these verses, the elders are not lords but slaves. Moreover, 1 Peter 5:3, a word to the elders, says, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; There is only one Lord&mdash;Christ. The elders should be not lords but examples.</p>
<p>Organizations in secular society are led by someone such as a chairman, president, or chief executive. When the head of such an organization sees that a restroom is not clean, he will give an order to his secretary, and the secretary will charge the janitor to clean the restroom. In the church life, however, there are no secretaries and no janitors, and the elders are not leaders. Thus, when the elders see a need, rather than giving an order, they should take the lead by being an example. Then the rest of the saints should follow the elders&rsquo; example. The elders are not leaders who give orders but those who take the lead by being examples, pioneers. If they function in this way and the other saints follow, the result will be a healthy church life. It is a secular concept that the elders are higher than others or that they are lords or leaders. If the elders are leaders in a secular sense, they become an insult to the leadership of Christ.</p>
<p>Some may be concerned that this teaching will bring in rebellion. Thus, we also need to point out Hebrews 13:17, which says, &ldquo;Obey the ones leading you and submit to them.&rdquo; The church life should be full of obedience but not obedience to a kind of human leadership. This is difficult to explain, because our understanding has been spoiled by secular organization. The eldership in the church is absolutely another kind of leadership, one which worldly people cannot understand. We should not use our natural mentality to try to understand the eldership. Romans 12:2 says that our mind needs to be renewed. Even in understanding the matter of the eldership, our mind should be renewed. There is a difference between being a leader and taking the lead. An elder is not a leader but one taking the lead. The Lord Jesus is the Leader, and the elders are those who take the lead.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the elders are not leaders but examples, not rulers but those who take the lead to do things. On the other hand, all the saints should follow the example of the elders and obey them. A proper church life is full of obedience but not human leadership. The leadership is solely the Lord&rsquo;s. We are all under one leadership; we respect Christ&rsquo;s unique leadership. The elders are not the leaders but simply the leading ones, those who take the lead to be an example in everything. The rest of the saints should follow and obey the elders.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God ordained that there be one king at a time among His people, such as David and then Solomon. However, in the New Testament there were always several apostles and several elders, never only one. This is quite meaningful. Furthermore, it was not always the same one among the apostles and elders who took the lead. Roman Catholics commonly believe that Peter was always first among the apostles. However, this is incorrect, for in Acts 15 it was James and not Peter who was taking the lead among the apostles and the elders (vv. 5-13).</p>
<p>Because Peter was bold on the day of Pentecost, he took the lead at that time (2:14). However, Galatians 2:9 lists James before Peter. The subsequent verses reveal that this was because Peter had become weak. Verse 12 says that Peter continually ate with the Gentile believers, but when the Jewish believers came to Antioch, he shrank back from eating with the Gentiles. Peter had received a vision from God in Acts 10 that there was no longer any difference between the Jews and the Gentiles, but he did not keep this vision. Because Peter became weak, James began to take the lead.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:12 says, &ldquo;Before some came from James.&rdquo; The phrase <em>from James</em> is used to mean &ldquo;from Jerusalem&rdquo; in this verse, indicating that James was taking the lead. Acts 21:18 also proves that eventually James, not Peter, was the leading one among the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem. Peter&rsquo;s losing his position as the leading apostle proves that there is no official or permanent leading one among the apostles or among the elders. In Acts 13:2 the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; In this instance Barnabas was mentioned first. However, as they were on their journey, Paul began to take the lead (vv. 9, 13, 16). This again proves that there is no permanent or official leadership among the apostles. This matter depends on present spiritual capacity.</p>
<p>The plurality of the apostles and of the elders indicates that in the New Testament God preserves the headship absolutely for Christ. This means that there is no definite, official, permanent, or organizational leadership in the church. Who takes the lead among the apostles and among the elders depends on present spiritual capacity. Because Peter had the highest capacity on the day of Pentecost, he was the leading one in that time and place. However, when there was a conference among the apostles and elders in Acts 15, after Peter and Paul spoke, it was James who made the final decision, because at that time James had the top capacity.</p>
<p>Suppose there are four elders in a locality. One elder may have the greatest capacity in a certain area. Therefore, he takes the lead in that area. However, if a different brother has more capacity in another area, that brother is the leading one in that area. This arrangement reveals God&rsquo;s wisdom in His New Testament economy to preserve the leadership and the headship solely and absolutely for Christ. According to God&rsquo;s economy, there is no official, permanent, definite, or organizational leadership among His people.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s list of the functions in the church in 1 Corinthians 12:28, he mentions helps and then administrations. Helps are the services of the deacons, and administrations are the functions of the elders. The order Paul uses is not according to our natural concept, which places the elders higher than the deacons. Paul may have purposely placed the helps of the deacons before the administrations of the elders to indicate that there is no rank among the functions in the church.</p>
<p>In the church Christ is the unique Leader. The elders are those who take the lead to set up an example. Furthermore, if we take Christ as our Head, we will surely obey the ones leading us. No wife who does not take Christ as her Head can obey her husband. The headship in our home should not be the husband. I am a husband, and in my home I never assume that I am the head. Instead, I always say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Head. You are the Head not only of my wife but also of me.&rdquo; Because my wife also takes Christ as her Head, our home is full of obedience and submission.</p>
<p>Among many Christians today there is a worldly, natural concept concerning eldership. They consider eldership as kingship. Some Christians even misuse Brother Nee&rsquo;s book <em>Authority and Submission</em> to set themselves up as kings and to make other believers their subjects. This is absolutely ugly. The eldership in the church is not a kind of leadership; it is simply to take the lead among the saints to set up an example. When all the other saints, taking Christ as their Head, obey and follow the elders, the church will be filled with proper submission and obedience, and there will be a beautiful order. We have only one leadership, the headship of Christ, yet the church life is full of obedience and submission.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO HIERARCHY<br />
AMONG THE APOSTLES, ELDERS, OR CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Honoring the unique headship of Christ keeps us from hierarchy. There being no official, permanent, or unique leading one among the apostles or elders in the New Testament means that there was no hierarchy. This principle applies to the local churches as well&mdash;all are on the same level. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, there is no such thing as a head church. Neither is there any rank among the churches. No matter how new or small a local church may be, it is on the same level as all the other churches. In the first century some considered Jerusalem to be the head church. This may have been part of the reason that God sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem. We should not consider any local church to be higher than others. In order to prevent His people from falling into hierarchy, God would not allow there to be a head church.</p>
<p>Just as we should not consider any church to be the head church, neither should we consider any man to be the leader of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I am not the leader; I am only a bondslave of Christ ministering the word of God to His people. I do not have any authority in myself. Any authority in my speaking comes from the Word of God. When speaking points of the truth, we should not say, &ldquo;Brother So-and-so says...&rdquo; Instead, we should discern what is according to the Bible and say, &ldquo;The Bible says...&rdquo; We do not have any leader in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This prevents hierarchy from coming in. If all the saints know and practice the truth, no one will have the freedom to claim to be a leader in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to learn and practice the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12, 15-19, 27; 2:2-3, 6-9, 16-17, 19-23; 3:4, 10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING<br />
TO CARE ONLY FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a full and complete type of Christ (Exo. 25:8-9; John 1:14). When the children of Israel were right with the tabernacle, everything was all right with them. Whenever they were not right with the tabernacle, there were problems, troubles, and defeat. This shows that when the church today is right with Christ, everything is all right. However, when we do not pay our full attention to Christ, we have trouble. Difficult, trying situations arise among the churches mainly due to our attention deviating from Christ, the center of God&rsquo;s economy. Our intention, our attention, and every part of our being should be fully occupied with Christ. We should not care for anything else.</p>
<p>The enemy is subtle. If he were to use idols or obviously worldly things, we would not be distracted from Christ. Therefore, the enemy instead uses things that are apparently good and even seemingly for God&rsquo;s interests yet are not Christ Himself. For instance, we may begin to be concerned for gaining more increase. It seems right to try to find a way to gain a larger increase for the churches. We may begin to talk much about this matter and at some point make a decision concerning how we will carry something out. This could be the opening of a gate for many subtle distractions, which will bring in questions, stir up disputations, and eventually lead to divisions. A tide of things other than Christ may begin to occupy the saints&rsquo; thoughts, hearts, and conversations, thus leading many saints and even churches away from Christ.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be in peace and harmony as long as we stay on the central lane of Christ as life. We should care only for the experience of Christ. If we stray from this central lane and problems come in, our rescue is simply to come back to Christ. Nothing but Christ can rescue us from deviations and distractions and keep us in a proper condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR PORTION BEING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is the portion of the saints. Colossians 1:12 says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; Christ is not only our inheritance to enjoy in the future but also our portion to partake of today. What God has allotted to us is an all-inclusive person, the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is not only our Redeemer, Savior, Master, and Lord but also our portion.</p>
<p>A portion is for enjoyment. Christ as our portion is for us to enjoy; He is our enjoyment. God has qualified us to enjoy Christ. In Luke 15, when the prodigal son returned, he was unqualified to enter into the father&rsquo;s house to partake of a feast because he was dressed in poor clothing. Therefore, the father told the servants, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet&rdquo; (v. 22). By putting these three things on his son, the father qualified him to enter into the house to partake of the feast. In verse 23 the father said, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry.&rdquo; The fattened calf, which was the son&rsquo;s portion to enjoy, is a type of Christ.</p>
<p>Our portion from God is not heaven or merely salvation but the all-inclusive Christ. We need to drop all the considerations and concepts that distract us, and we must come back to Christ. Christ is the only answer to any kind of doctrinal disputation. We need to pay our full attention to Christ. We have been qualified for one thing&mdash;the enjoyment of Christ. When we are fully occupied by Christ, we have no room for other things. Christ is our eternal, divine, all-inclusive portion. God&rsquo;s economy, His eternal purpose, and His heart&rsquo;s desire are for Christ to be our portion. We need to care only for this portion. Different opinions and teachings may creep into the church life to subtly corrupt the thoughts and feelings of the saints, causing them to lose their absoluteness for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and their hunger for the ministry. The way to close the gate to different opinions is to drop our concepts and come back to Christ to enjoy Him as our unique portion from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ASPECTS OF CHRIST REVEALED IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>Many aspects of Christ as our portion are revealed in Colossians. In 1:15 Paul says that Christ is the image of the invisible God. God is invisible, yet Christ is His image, His expression. Paul goes on in verse 15 to tell us that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. Christ is God the Creator, yet He is also the first item of all creation, and in Him all things were created (v. 16). Moreover, all things cohere in Him. To cohere in Christ means to subsist together in Him, much like the spokes of a wheel are held together by a hub. Without the hub, the spokes fall apart. The hub is the center by which and in which all the spokes subsist. Scientists recognize that there is something in the universe that holds all things together. All things cohere in and by this holding center. The Bible reveals that Christ is this holding center. Creation came into being through Christ, and all creation exists in Christ.</p>
<p>Our life is our personal universe, and this universe needs a holding center. Christ is the holding center of the universe, and He should also be the center of our life. We need to worship Him, praying, &ldquo;Lord, You are the center of my life. My whole life coheres in You. Without You, love, light, life, holiness, righteousness, kindness, and submission all fall apart. But with You and in You all virtues subsist.&rdquo; Our marriage needs Christ as its holding center. If a husband and wife cohere in Christ, they will never fall apart. Christ should be the center of our personal life, family life, and Christian life.</p>
<p>In order for the harmony to be kept among the churches, the saints must never neglect Christ as the holding center. The strategy of the enemy is to subtly replace Christ in the churches. When we do not pay sufficient attention to Christ, the door is open for many problems to come into the church life. We must not be distracted by seemingly good things such as trying to find a way to gain a great increase or have fully released meetings. A meeting may appear to be released yet lack anything of light, truth, or Christ. We must not be deceived or distracted to deviate from Christ. We need to be alert for anything that may replace Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s purpose in His recovery is to recover Christ as everything to the believers. Therefore, we need to forget about everything else and come back to Christ, the all-inclusive One. He is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, and the One in whom all things were created and in whom all things cohere. Colossians 1:18-19 says, &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colossians 2:2 reveals that Christ is the mystery of God. God&rsquo;s mystery is Christ, who is our portion. In Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden (v. 3). Verse 9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Christ is also the reality of every positive thing in the universe. Verses 16 through 17 say, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the reality of food, water, air, light, and all material enjoyment. We need to realize that Christ is everything to us. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo; We need to learn what it means to walk in Christ in a practical way.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 reveals that Christ is the reality of the church life. Verses 10 through 11 say, &ldquo;Put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The new man is the Body, the church. Christ is all persons in the new man. In the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, every natural person is annulled, including every race, nationality, religion, and status, and Christ is all. We need to see that Christ is the unique constituent of the church.</p>
<p>We can see from the many items in Colossians that Christ is all-inclusive. Such a Christ is our portion. We need to enjoy Him, participate in Him, and partake of Him daily and hourly. Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. Today Christ is our life. In the future He will be our glory. This is our hope.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST BEING THE WAY TO GO ON<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The only way to have genuine oneness is by taking the all-inclusive Christ as our life and our person. When we enjoy Christ, we spontaneously drop our opinions, concepts, ways, movements, and activities. Oneness comes not from a kind of coordination or mutual understanding but from the Christ whom we experience. Actually, genuine oneness is Christ Himself. We should reject any kind of organization, which leads to hierarchy and therefore insults the headship of Christ. All the local churches are on the same level. There should be no organization among the churches, elders, or apostles. According to the New Testament, there is no permanent, official, or organizational leader among the elders or apostles. Rather, there is always a plurality among the apostles and elders, because the leadership and the headship in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are ascribed absolutely to Christ. Activities and movements may lead saints and even churches away from Christ and do much damage. We need to come back to the beginning to care only for Christ.</p>
<p>The proper way to preach the gospel and gain the increase is through fruit-bearing. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:5). As branches in the vine, if we simply live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, fruit will spontaneously come forth from the life within. Fruit is the outflow of life. Our living should be our preaching.</p>
<p>The proper Christian meeting is a display of our daily life. If we argue with our spouse just before attending a meeting, anything we do to function in the meeting will be a performance. We should daily live Christ and then come together to exhibit Christ. We need to drop our concepts and come back to Christ. As we live Christ, speak Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, we will spontaneously bear fruit. This is the way of life. We should care not for numbers, movements, or gimmicks but only for living Christ as branches in the vine.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRANSMISSION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:27; 2:6; 3:11, 16; John 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR ALL-INCLUSIVE PORTION<br />
AND THE UNIQUE CONSTITUENT<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Christ is our all-inclusive portion. The Bible reveals that He possesses both divinity and humanity. He is the mystery of God, and God&rsquo;s fullness dwells in Him bodily. Thus, Christ is the embodiment of God. In Him we have all the riches and all the fullness of what God is. Furthermore, in Christ are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. Because of the processes Christ passed through, the elements of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have been compounded into Him. Christ embodies not only God but also incarnation, His wonderful all-inclusive, all-accomplishing death, His powerful, unlimited resurrection, and His ascension.</p>
<p>This wonderful all-inclusive Christ is the content of the church. Colossians 3:11 says that in the new man &ldquo;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The content of the new man, the church, is not the believers but Christ. Because Christ is the unique person in the new man, Paul said, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Instead of living our old person, we need to live Christ, taking Christ as our person. As the unique constituent of the church, Christ should saturate our entire being as our life, nature, and person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT<br />
TRANSMITTING CHRIST INTO US</h2>
<p>Christ being our life is not a mere doctrine but a reality. However, it is difficult to understand how Christ can be real to us. We may use electricity to illustrate. Although we do not see the current of electricity, we have no doubt that electricity is real, because we see its operation in the lights and appliances in our homes and offices. Through wires electricity is transmitted from the power plant into buildings that may be hundreds of miles away. A switch also is needed. The wires transmit the electricity, and the switch causes it to be applied. When the switch is on, the electricity is on.</p>
<p>Like electricity, Christ is mysterious and abstract yet real. We may be likened to buildings that depend on electricity. Our spiritual life depends entirely upon Christ. Christ is the heavenly electricity, and He is transmitted to us through two &ldquo;wires&rdquo;&mdash;the word and the Spirit. The word which is in the Bible may be called the ground wire or the earthly wire, and the Spirit may be called the antenna or the heavenly wire. Through the word and the Spirit, the heavenly Christ is continually transmitted into our being. Just as electricity is in the wires, Christ today is in the word and the Spirit. Objectively, Christ is in the heavens, and subjectively, He is in us. But practically, He is in the word and the Spirit. In order to practically experience Christ, we need the &ldquo;wires&rdquo; of the word and the Spirit. The switch that causes Christ as the heavenly electricity to be applied is our human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD, CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND LIFE<br />
BEING EMBODIED IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; We know that the Word here is Christ, because verse 14 says that the Word became flesh. Thus, the Word, who is Christ, is God. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Lastly, in 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all invisible and abstract. However, God&rsquo;s word in the Bible is solid. We can hold and read the Bible. Electricity is invisible, but a wire is solid. God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all embodied in the word. Therefore, the word is the key to the Christian life. Without this key we do not have God, Christ, the Spirit, or life. The word is crucial to us.</p>
<p>The burden in this message is that we would gain an appreciation for the word. The Bible is not an ordinary book, for the word in the Bible is the embodiment of God, Christ, the Spirit, and life. This fact is proved in our experience. When we come to the Word, we sense that we come into the presence of God. As we read, we have a deep sense that we are in God. We never have the same sense when reading a secular magazine. The more we read the Bible, the more we sense that we are bathing in the presence of God. The word refreshes, releases, soothes, and comforts us because it is the embodiment of God. In order to find God, we must come to the Bible. When we contact the word in the Bible, we touch God, for the word conveys God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.</p><h2 class="head1">DAILY CONTACTING THE LORD THROUGH THE WORD BEING A LIFE NECESSITY</h2>
<p>Because the word in the Bible embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life, we Christians need to come to the Bible daily and even hourly. We should not take the excuse that we do not have time. Finding time to spend in the word depends on our realization of its importance. We all find time to eat every day, no matter how sloppy, lazy, or loose we may be, because we realize that eating is a life necessity. If we do not eat, we will die. When we see that reading the Word is a life necessity, we will find time to do it.</p>
<p>We need to spend time in the word every morning. Spoiled children may say that they cannot rise up early in the morning, but when they become adults, they are able to rise early every morning in order to keep their job, the source of their living. Everyone can make it because life necessity teaches us. Contacting the Bible is much more important than keeping a job or eating breakfast. There is no excuse for not contacting the Lord through the word every morning.</p>
<p>Some consider that being legal is always bad. However, in order to live, we need to keep four legalities&mdash;eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping. Furthermore, without legalities, it is impossible to have a strong family, school, corporation, government, nation, or military force. When young men enter the military service, they have no liberty. From the time they enter, everything is a legality. The length of their hair and when they rise up are not for them to decide. They are given a specific amount of time to complete every task. Legality makes everything healthy and strong. The United States is a democratic country, a country of liberty, but it is also a country of legalities. If someone drives a car even a little too fast, he or she may receive a ticket from the police. Those who do not care for the law and do not behave legally are penalized. Even the president must follow the laws. It is for this reason that the United States is a strong nation. It is a country of freedom, but no one is free from the law. People are free, but they must exercise their freedom legally, within the bounds of the law.</p>
<p>A person who goes to sleep early, rises early, and eats regularly in a legal way is a healthy person. A loose person cannot be healthy. We need to be normal, strict, formal, and legal. The higher a life is, the more legalities it has. The Christian life is the highest life.</p>
<p>We need to try our best to come to the Bible for at least ten minutes every morning. We should seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to which book of the Bible will meet our need at the present time. Once we have His leading, we should gradually read through the book from the beginning to the end, reading and praying over a few verses every morning. By praying over some verses, we will receive the nourishment from them. After practicing this every morning for a few months, we will be spiritually healthy. I thank the Lord for His mercy that for over fifty years I have spent time in the Word nearly every day. This has kept me. Every morning before we do anything, we need to come to the Word. Regardless of how early we go to work, we can spend ten minutes to read a portion of the Word and pray over it to receive spiritual nourishment. This will bring us into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>In addition to praying over a few verses each morning to be nourished, later in the day we should try to read a few chapters. It is possible to read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament each day. In this way we can finish reading the whole Bible once a year.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING CHRIST<br />
BY DAILY RECEIVING THE WORD<br />
AND TOUCHING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible and take the word into us, it becomes the Spirit in us. The word and the Spirit are actually one thing. The word is outside of us. When we take it in, it becomes the Spirit. When we speak it forth, it becomes the word again. We should not consider the word to be separate from the Spirit. The Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). For this reason, when we receive the word from the Bible, we contact the Lord and receive the Spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo; We receive Christ by the word and the Spirit. Receiving Christ is not merely a doctrinal matter; it becomes practical when we receive the word in the Bible and touch the Spirit. The word and the Spirit both convey Christ, because Christ is embodied in the word and has become the Spirit (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45).</p>
<p>We need to receive Christ daily and hourly. We cannot eat food once for all; we need to eat several times a day. Likewise, we need to receive Christ several times each day by the unique way of receiving the word and touching the Spirit. It is a good habit to always carry a Bible with us to be able to receive the word. Each time we receive the word and touch the Spirit, we receive another portion of Christ. It is crucial that we build up such a daily habit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF<br />
CHRIST, HIS DEATH, AND HIS RESURRECTION,<br />
CONVEYING NOURISHING AND KILLING</h2>
<p>We need to see what the elements in the word are. When we eat food, we spontaneously take in the vitamins that are in the food. The natural &ldquo;antibiotics&rdquo; in our food kill the negative germs within us. Our food also contains nourishing elements, which supply the exact needs of our body. Our energy and strength come from these nourishing elements. After entering into our body, our food is processed through metabolism, which includes catabolism, a breaking down, and anabolism, a building up. Catabolism is destructive and is therefore a killing. Anabolism is constructive. Daily receiving the word produces in us a spiritual metabolism, which on one hand destroys the negative elements and on the other hand builds us up spiritually. We all need such a metabolism to grow in the Christian life.</p>
<p>The Bible contains many histories, prophecies, parables, types, and exhortations. These may be likened to different dishes, but they are not the basic elements. The basic elements in a sandwich are flour, meat, and vegetables. These same three elements may be used to prepare many different dishes, such as Chinese dumplings and Italian spaghetti. These dishes differ only in form; in essence they are the same. The word of the Bible is also composed of three basic elements&mdash;Christ, His death, and His resurrection. Every time we come to the Bible, we receive these three elements. Whether we read histories, parables, prophecies, exhortations, psalms, or proverbs, we receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</p>
<p>Christ is the nourishing element in the word. In Christ there is the killing of His death, which may be likened to catabolism. Christ&rsquo;s death destroys our self, flesh, lusts, selfishness, and natural concepts and emotions. Every day we need to be under this destruction. Every portion of the Bible conveys the killing of Christ&rsquo;s death to deal with our natural life. This killing is the effectiveness of the death of Christ, which has been compounded in Christ. The killing element of Christ&rsquo;s death is typified by the salt in the meal offering described in Leviticus 2. The frankincense in the meal offering signifies Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. In the meal offering there is no honey, which typifies natural affection. The fine flour in the meal offering signifies Christ Himself with His fine humanity. In every portion in the Bible the basic elements are Christ, the killing of His death, and the power of His resurrection. The killing of Christ&rsquo;s death and the building up of His resurrection received through the word produce in us a healthy spiritual metabolism. This is the way to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF LIFE ORDAINED BY GOD IN HIS ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The experience of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion and the transmission of Christ through the word and the Spirit are the way of life ordained by God in His economy. However, God&rsquo;s enemy has brought in many other things to replace these simple life matters among Christians. For instance, many activities have come in. Even Bible reading becomes an activity if we set aside only one or two weeks per year to study the Bible. Our physical eating is not an occasional activity or organized movement but a daily life necessity. Eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping are not special activities but legalities, or necessities, of our daily living. Reading the Bible is our spiritual eating.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel also should not become an activity that is different from our daily living. The proper gospel preaching is our daily living. We need to live the gospel. According to God&rsquo;s economy, gospel preaching is fruit-bearing (John 15:1-17). As branches of Christ the vine, we do not need any activity, movement, schedule, or plan. We will spontaneously produce fruit if we daily live and grow Christ. Fruit is the spontaneous outflow of the inner life. It is not an activity but a living. Many whom we contact in our daily life observe how we live. If we live Christ, some may outwardly despise us, but deep within they will know that we are a proper person. If our living is a shining testimony of Jesus, when a family member, neighbor, colleague, or classmate goes through a difficult situation, he or she may remember us and invite us for a visit. When we go, we may only need to speak a few words to lead the person to pray to receive the Lord. To bear fruit in this way is possible for every believer, and this way is more effective than large gospel meetings. If an ordinary believer simply lives Christ, many of the ones he or she knows will eventually turn to the Lord. Those we gain for the Lord in this way will be remaining fruit. This way is easy, normal, and spontaneous. The crucial point is that we all need to live Christ.</p>
<p>Living Christ to spontaneously bear fruit is the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, for this is what was practiced in the beginning of the church life in Acts. The hundred and twenty in Acts 1:15 did not have a schedule. They were praying together (v. 14) when the Spirit was suddenly poured out on the day of Pentecost (2:1-4). The early believers did not have a plan to go to Samaria in chapter 8; only Philip was led to go there (vv. 4-5). In chapter 13 the brothers in Antioch did not have a plan to go to Europe. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; Barnabas and Saul were called and sent (v. 3), but they did not plan where they would go. Then in Act 16 Paul was at the western tip of Asia Minor. After being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to go in two other directions, Paul saw a vision of a man entreating him to come over into Macedonia, which was across the Aegean Sea in Europe (vv. 6-10). There was no plan or schedule; there was only the living of Christ.</p>
<p>When we see that living Christ is the proper way to preach the gospel, we will not use any gimmicks. If we are faithful to live Christ, those we know will gradually turn to the Lord. When gimmicks come into our gospel preaching, the result is different opinions, concepts, and eventually disputation. There is no positive result. This is absolutely wrong. We need to drop the gimmicks and come back to God&rsquo;s way of life by living Christ.</p>
<p>The proper way for the churches to spread is also a matter of life. After a church grows normally for a few years, a small group of saints may spontaneously move to a nearby city and raise up a church there. Those who know the truth and have the necessary measure of life will spontaneously take the lead in the new church. To be equipped for this purpose, some of the young brothers should spend more time in the Word and learn the truths while they are growing and living Christ. The churches can continue to spread in this way year after year, growing and spreading to nearby cities. Spreading in this way is spontaneous and simple. Eventually, there will be several local churches in an area, all living Christ, loving and helping one another, and fellowshipping all the time, yet without human control, hierarchy, organization, or maneuvering. What a wonderful situation!</p>
<p>The churches should never be controlled like the branches of a corporation. To organizationally transfer saints to different localities is altogether against the truth and against the principle of the Body. The church is an organism, which cannot be rearranged like an organization. We do not need to try to maneuver saints to unify the churches or make every church the same. We should accept all the churches as they are. The local churches may be likened to families. Unlike the branch offices of some corporations, every family is different. The members of one family may be highly intelligent; the members of another family may not be as intelligent. Nevertheless, both are genuine families. What is important in a family, as in a local church, is not outward qualifications or gifts but love, life, and harmony. Transferring members between two different families to try to balance the situation will only damage both families. The local churches should be left to grow without human interference. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no unification, competition, or rivalry, but only harmony, love, and fellowship.</p>
<p>If we see this principle, we will drop our concepts and care only for Christ as life. Any migration should be based on the Lord&rsquo;s leading, not on human planning or activity. We only need to live Christ, fellowship with Him, and follow His leading. Then we will be like our father Abraham, who &ldquo;went out, not knowing where he was going&rdquo; (Heb. 11:8). He simply followed the presence of the Lord. Today we should be the same, having no plan, schedule, expectation, or outward goal. Living Christ in a peaceful way in our daily life is our living testimony of the Lord Jesus and is the proper church life. If all the saints practice this, the churches will spontaneously have the proper increase and then spreading. This way is full of life, harmony, and testimony.</p>
<p>We are nonsectarian, general, inclusive, and open to fellowship with all genuine believers. However, we should not have the intention to gain Christians from other groups. Instead, we should live Christ and pray daily for the Lord to lead us to those who need salvation. As we share with those whom the Lord brings to us, some will turn to the Lord and be brought into the church life. When we contact other Christians, according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading within, we should simply fellowship with them, ministering Christ to them and receiving their Christ. Other Christians should have a clear impression that we are not sectarian or for building up our own work; they should sense only that we live Christ and love all the believers. Whether they would turn the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is altogether in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>We need to drop our concepts, activities, aggressiveness, and passivity and simply live Christ, pray, and fellowship together. Wherever we are, we should come together as the church, the local expression of Christ. Wherever we go, we should meet with the saints in that place as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. Christ is everything in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. There are no organizations, ways, gimmicks, or activities. We must keep this principle. We also need to spend time in the Word, learn the truth, and teach, edify, and shepherd others. This is the proper way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:17; 8:32; 14:6a, 17; 17:17; 1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18; 3:8; 4:3-4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING TO BE<br />
FULL OF LIFE AND TRUTH</h2>
<p>The two Epistles to Timothy were written during a time of the church&rsquo;s degradation. These two books are full of light; several extraordinary, new, and fresh terms are used. For instance, 1 Timothy 3:15 mentions &ldquo;the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; Here we can see that the church is a house and also a pillar and base. In ancient times buildings were supported by pillars, which were held by bases. Paul said that the church is such a pillar and base to bear the truth. The church being the house of the living God indicates that it is related to life, and the church being the pillar and base of the truth indicates that it is related to reality. In a time of the church&rsquo;s degradation, what is needed is life and truth.</p>
<p>What we need today is not forms, activities, movements, organization, vain doctrines, or empty knowledge but only life and truth. In the church life we need to pay our full attention to life and truth, or reality, which are both Christ Himself. To withstand the shaking of storms, the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need the solid foundation of life, but they also need the pillar of the truth. We must not only be living but also properly equipped to speak the truths.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRUTH BEING NOT MERE DOCTRINE BUT REALITY</h2>
<p>We first need to know the meaning of the word <em>truth</em> in the Bible. The same Greek word in the New Testament is translated as &ldquo;truth&rdquo; or &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in various places. John 1:17 says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The law was given; reality, or truth, came. John 8:32 says, &ldquo;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&rdquo; The Lord said in 14:6, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; Verse 17 mentions the Spirit of reality. Finally, 17:17 says, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; It is clear from these cases that <em>truth</em> in New Testament usage means not doctrines or principles but reality, actual fact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE UNIQUE REALITY</h2>
<p>John 1:17 contrasts the law and reality. The Old Testament age was a time of law; the New Testament age is a time of reality. What is in the law is not reality but only a shadow. The term <em>the law and the prophets</em> is used in the New Testament to refer to the Old Testament&mdash;Genesis through Song of Songs being the law, and Isaiah through Malachi being the prophets. <em>The law</em> refers especially to the five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy. What is mentioned in these books is shadows and types. For instance, Genesis 2 mentions the tree of life, but John 15:1; 11:25; and 14:6 reveal that Christ is the real tree of life. Genesis 3:15 prophesies of the seed of the woman, who will bruise the head of the serpent. These words, spoken by God after man&rsquo;s fall, were the first preaching of the gospel. Eve probably thought that this prophecy was fulfilled with the birth of Cain. However, the real seed of the woman, Christ, was born of the virgin Mary. The shadow is in Genesis 3; the reality is in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Passover lamb is first mentioned in Exodus 12:3. In John 1:29, when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; The lamb in Exodus 12 was only a shadow; the real Lamb of God is Christ. In Exodus 25 through 30 God commanded the children of Israel to build a tabernacle for Him. The fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle is revealed in John 1:14, which says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Christ is the reality of the tabernacle. Furthermore, the burnt offering, meal offering, sin offering, trespass offering, peace offering, and free will offering described in Leviticus are types of Christ, who is the reality of all the offerings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the real life, light, love, holiness, and righteousness are Christ. Apart from Christ, these are mere empty terms. A person&rsquo;s name is empty and meaningless until the person himself appears. Likewise, the law was empty until Christ, who is the reality, came (John 1:17). The Jews dealt with the empty law for fifteen hundred years. When Christ came, the reality of all that their forefathers had studied appeared. The person of Christ is the reality of many otherwise empty terms in the Old Testament. This illustrates what is meant by <em>truth</em> in the New Testament&mdash;that which is real. Christ is the one reality in the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In John 14:16-17 Jesus said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.&rdquo; The word <em>another</em> indicates that there was already one Comforter. Christ, who is the reality, was the first Comforter. However, when He lived among His disciples on the earth, He could not enter into them. Therefore, another Comforter needed to come&mdash;the Spirit of reality. Because Christ is reality (v. 6), the title <em>the Spirit of reality</em> refers to the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit is the second Comforter. However, the second is actually another form of the first&mdash;the Spirit is another form of Christ. In His incarnation Christ took one step to become a man, and in His resurrection He took another step to become the Spirit. First, God became the flesh (1:14); then the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Thus, the life-giving Spirit is the reality of Christ.</p>
<p>Without the Spirit, Jesus would be only a name. The Spirit is the person of Christ, the reality of Christ. For this reason, 1 Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When we call a person&rsquo;s name, the person comes, for the person is the reality of the name. Similarly, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we receive the Spirit, because the Spirit is the person of Christ. Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the person, the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING REVELATION TO SEE THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>As the house of the living God, the church should be full of life, and as the pillar and base of the truth, the church should be full of reality. Doctrines are easily understood. However, conveyed in the doctrines is the truth, the reality. What is needed to apprehend the truth is not mere knowledge or mental comprehension but revelation. We learn doctrines by reading or listening, but we see the truth, the reality, by revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Truth of Baptism</h2>
<p>It is not sufficient to understand doctrine; we also need to see the truth. For instance, many Christians study the Bible to try to discern various matters related to baptism, such as who can be baptized, who can baptize others, what kind of water to use, and other aspects of the outward form of baptism. These are all doctrinal matters. Among Christians, different practices related to baptism come from different understandings of the doctrine of baptism. However, the doctrine is not the reality.</p>
<p>The truth, the reality, of baptism is the death and resurrection of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4). When we baptize people, we should exercise our faith in the power of the Spirit and help the ones being baptized to realize that they are being baptized not only into the water but also into the Spirit and into the death and resurrection of Christ. Being put into death and resurrection through baptism changes a person. Someone who has been baptized has died and resurrected. The reality of the death and resurrection of Christ is applied in the Spirit to a person who is baptized. This is the truth of baptism. Doctrines lead to differences in opinion and endless arguments. When we care for reality instead of doctrines, there is no argument. Regardless of the outward forms of baptism, the reality of baptism is being put into the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Truth of the Lord&rsquo;s Table</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s table is another matter concerning which Christians hold different doctrines. Christian scholars have studied many doctrines concerning the Lord&rsquo;s table, such as how many cups to use, whether to use wine or grape juice, what kind of bread to use, and when and how often to have the table. Even after much biblical and historical study, it is impossible to reach a definite conclusion on some of these issues. However, we should not care for the study of the empty doctrines. Instead, we need to see the truth, the reality, of the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>The truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table is that the loaf signifies Christ&rsquo;s physical body, which He gave on the cross for our sins, and also His mystical Body, which includes all His believers. When we partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table, we are participating in the Lord&rsquo;s Body. This requires not knowledge but the exercise of our spirit by faith. When we see the Body, signified by the bread, we are reminded of the Head. Where the Body is, the Head is also. The separation of the body and the blood, signified by the separation of the bread and the cup, displays the death of Christ. Furthermore, resurrection is seen in the loaf, for a loaf is not one grain of wheat but many grains produced in resurrection and blended together into one. In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we were begotten as the many grains and formed into His one Body.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we should not merely keep a doctrinal form. Instead, we need to see the truth, the reality, of the Body, the Head, Christ&rsquo;s death, and His resurrection. At the Lord&rsquo;s table we are participating in the Body under Christ as the Head, and we are realizing His death and resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s table displays Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection to the universe and declares that we are one with Him by eating Him and living by Him. This is the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO KNOW AND BEAR THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In addition to reading the Bible to learn the doctrines, we need to open to the Lord to see the truth, praying, &ldquo;Lord, I need Your enlightenment, revelation, and vision so that I may see the reality in every doctrine.&rdquo; As the pillar and base of the truth, the church should stand firmly, bearing all the reality&mdash;the reality of life, light, power, holiness, salvation, redemption, and many other items. The Word does not say that the elders or the apostles are the pillar and base of the truth; rather, it says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15). This means that everyone in the church, including the sisters, the young ones, and the new ones, should know and bear the truth.</p>
<p>We all need to know the truth of matters such as reconciliation, justification, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation. The young saints may sing and release their spirit in the meetings, but if no truth is taught in the meetings, the release is vain. After being in the meetings for a few years, the saints should know the truth. The meetings should be full of reality, full of truth.</p>
<p>The top universities do not give students a good time; rather, they give them a hard time for four years. For students to have a hard time means that they will receive a valuable degree after four years. If a student has a good time every day, his or her education will mean nothing. Having a good time and being entertained are vanity. The church life is not for vanity but for reality. In every meeting we should receive some reality. We should care not for having a good time but for learning the truth. We first need to read and study the Bible. We then need to open to the Lord and pray, looking to Him for His enlightening. Eventually, we will receive a vision and see the truth.</p>
<p>I was born into a Christian family in China. From my youth I heard speaking concerning redemption and salvation. However, these matters were taught only as empty terms. Many Western missionaries whom I heard in China preached doctrine; few preached reality. Many Christians I knew as a youth were not truly saved. They learned doctrines but lacked reality.</p>
<p>In the province of Hunan there were several Lutheran congregations, and all the Lutheran pastors knew and preached the doctrine of justification by faith. One such pastor was also an opium smuggler. A Norwegian missionary named Marie Monsen came to his city preaching not doctrine but the reality of regeneration. After giving a message, she asked this pastor in front of several members of his congregation if he had been regenerated. He said that he had been regenerated, but Miss Monsen said that the appearance of his face and the tone of his voice showed that he had not been regenerated. He was filled with shame and anger. That night he even began planning to kill Miss Monsen. However, while he was plotting, the Holy Spirit spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;Look how evil you are! It is true that you have not been regenerated.&rdquo; As soon as he began to open, the gift of repentance was bestowed on him. He repented with tears and was truly regenerated. When he returned the next day and gave his testimony, a genuine revival began and hundreds more experienced regeneration. This case illustrates the difference between doctrine and reality.</p>
<p>The reality of regeneration is Christ, who today is the life-giving Spirit. A person must repent and open to receive the Spirit of reality, which is Christ Himself. When we receive the Spirit, we have the reality of regeneration. Christ is also the reality of holiness. If Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit is daily wrought into our being, we will have not only the objective doctrine of holiness but also the subjective experience of sanctification. Thus, sanctification is Christ as holiness wrought into our being. The experience of Christ in sanctification is the reality of holiness.</p>
<p>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need both the proper doctrines and the truth, the reality. We should know the doctrines and also experience the reality by the enjoyment of Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Christ to us is not only the objective Christ in the third heaven but also the subjective Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit to be wrought into every corner and avenue of our inward being. Christ experienced as the Spirit in our spirit is the reality of every human virtue, including patience, humility, holiness, righteousness, and kindness. True patience and humility are Christ wrought into our being.</p>
<p>We need to spend much time reading the Word, first to receive nourishment, and second to gain knowledge of the doctrines. Then we need to pray that the Lord would grant us light to see the reality conveyed in the doctrines. The light needed to see the truth may come to us days, months, or even years after we read a portion of the Word. As a young believer, I studied the Bible intensely for seven and a half years, from 1925 through 1932, and learned many doctrines. Even today, forty-eight years later, those doctrines become truth under the Lord&rsquo;s enlightening.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we may find several key verses concerning a certain matter, such as holiness and sanctification. Then we will have a general sketch of the doctrinal knowledge of this matter. If we seek the Lord in prayer and are open to Him, the light will eventually come to enable us to see that holiness and sanctification are Christ Himself, who today is the life-giving Spirit. We will not only know the doctrine of holiness and sanctification, but we will also see the reality of these matters. Once we receive the Lord&rsquo;s enlightening to see the reality, we have much of the reality. The next step is for the reality to become our experience. If we are open, the life-giving Spirit will have the opportunity to work something of what the Lord has shown us into our being. Then the revelation will become our experience, and we will have the full reality.</p>
<p>Reality comes from knowledge of the Bible plus heavenly enlightenment and personal experience. We all need to gain reality in this way. To see the reality, we first need to spend time in the Word to be nourished and to become familiar with the doctrines of the Bible. The basis for enlightening is our knowledge of the doctrines. Then we need to daily walk in Christ, looking to Him for enlightenment. We do not know when, where, or how the light will come. Once we see the reality by the Lord&rsquo;s light, the reality will become our experience. Then we will have life and truth.</p>
<p>Each saint should be full of life and truth. When every brother and sister is full of life and truth, the church will be strong as the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. This is what is needed in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. May the Lord have mercy upon us all and grant us the sufficient grace to have the proper practice to be filled with life and truth.</p></body></html>
