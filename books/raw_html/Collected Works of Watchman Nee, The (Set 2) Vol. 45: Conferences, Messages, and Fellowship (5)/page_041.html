<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS<br />AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 13, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Luke 1:75</h1><h2 class="head1">THE STARTING POINT OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>A Christian should have many memorable dates written in his Bible. If he does not have many dates written in it, he will be like a calendar without dates. The history of God's creation is recorded in the Bible. In the same way the history of your new creation should be recorded there. Every Christian at least should have a date of salvation, a date of baptism, a date when he received the laying on of hands, and a date when he consecrated himself to the Lord. A Christian at least should have two beginnings&mdash;salvation and consecration. Every Christian should have a date when he was saved and when he consecrated himself to the Lord. If a man does not have a date of consecration, he is like someone without a date of salvation in the eyes of God. A train needs two tracks before it can run. In the same way a Christian must not only be saved but must be consecrated. Those who are saved but not consecrated are not running a proper race. Everyone in the world should be saved, and every saved person should be consecrated. After one goes through these two experiences, he has a proper beginning. A Christian who has never consecrated himself is not advancing at all; he has not taken the first step on his spiritual journey. Only after a person has passed through these two experiences can he begin his spiritual journey.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>A saved and consecrated person serves the Lord. Concerning our service to God, Luke 1:74-75 says, "Serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness." Holiness has to do with ourselves, whereas righteousness has to do with others. Holiness is for God, and it is a gift, whereas righteousness is acquired, and it is an expression. Holiness is a nature, and righteousness is a habit. Holiness is a life, and righteousness is a way. The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way...and the life" (John 14:6). Our life is holy, whereas our way is righteous. Life is in us, whereas the way is to be extended to others. After we have the life of holiness within, we still need a righteous living without. An outward, righteous living must be matched by an inward, holy life. A Christian can be very righteous, but unless he is also holy, his righteousness will not last. Holiness and righteousness refer to two aspects&mdash;inward and outward&mdash;which are indispensable. We have to serve God in holiness and righteousness. Tonight we will cover the matter of righteousness first. Righteousness refers to the way we deal with people and things.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH UNRIGHTEOUSNESSES</h2><p>An unsaved person lives an unrighteous life. He does not feel it. In fact, he may feel that he is quite good. But once a person believes in the Lord, he receives God's holy life into him, and he begins to deal with unrighteousness and to live a righteous life. He will allow righteousness to become a habitual, organic, and spontaneous thing in him. Are we righteous in the way we deal with people and things in our daily life? Have we collected something that we should not have collected? Have we paid what we should have paid? Have we taken something that we should not have taken? We must be right and righteous in all things. All righteous behavior is the result of the operation of the holy life and nature within.</p><p>Let me relate an old story to you. Three years after I was saved, I began to practice being righteous. However, I still did not know much about righteousness itself. One day I read an article in a magazine about a convention. At the convention one preacher was sitting away from the stage. When it was his turn to speak, he walked past someone and stepped on that person's raincoat. He did not apologize. When I read this, it occurred to me that this was wrong and unrighteous. The preacher did not have the right to step on the raincoat; it was unrighteous. After I received this light, I was enlightened as to how I should deal with unrighteousness.</p><p>There are many unrighteous things around us. Unrighteousness can be found in the way we deal with our money, attitude, time, responsibility, material possessions, and many other things. The pursuit of righteousness is an excellent exercise. The light of the Holy Spirit is like the ray of the sun, and we are like the glass in a window. If the glass is covered with dust, it will not be transparent. The problem is not with the shining of the sun but with the transparency of the glass. In the same way the problem is not with the light of the Spirit but with the shining within us. Our pursuit of righteousness is like cleaning the window; it makes us transparent and keeps us in the shining of the Spirit. In this way spiritually we become sensitive enough to live a righteous living.</p><p>There was an old lady in Shanghai who had been a Christian for thirty years. However, her living was a mess; she was still living unrighteously. One day I felt compelled to ask, "Have you ever apologized to anyone in your whole life?" She answered in Shanghainese: "Thank heaven! No." She did not receive any shining; she was as insensitive as she had always been. If you blow smoke into a man's eyes or pour water into his nose, he will react because he is a living person and because he is sensitive to these things. But if he is dead, he will not feel anything. When we act unrighteously, the greatest rebuke comes from within us.</p>
