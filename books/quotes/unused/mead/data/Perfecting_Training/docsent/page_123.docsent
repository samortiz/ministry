   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STAYING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You don t need to say turn to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You just need to stay in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past we have had a slogan Turn to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should drop this and instead we should say, Stay in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Stay means that you are already there in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You don t need such a long prayer to cause you to stay in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even a short prayer will cause you to stay in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you start to lose your temper just an O Lord will keep you in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although I am so busy all the day long, I O Lord a lot to remain in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you say, O Lord you stay in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our experience tells us that we do have the Spirit and the Spirit does dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not a kind of superstition; this is a divine spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may use the example of breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know there is air because we can breathe it in. And we know that we have a breathing organ because we can breathe in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the Lord is the Spirit, the pneuma, the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And we can breathe the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I like A. B. Simpson s hymn where he speaks of breathing, breathing, breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The point is this, dear saints: the Spirit really dwells in us, regardless of whether your weather is cold or hot or stormy or calm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>None of these things bothers Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether you are at home or you are in the wrong place, He still dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You do have Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You possess Him, and He occupies you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We only possess Him, but He not only possesses but also occupies us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that He is here all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So in a sense we don t need to turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We just need to stay in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we are clear that we have to stay in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But what kind of Spirit is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is this the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Or is this our human spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the past twenty years, I have spoken a lot of messages on the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some, who are short of knowledge, have condemned our teaching concerning the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One verse which refers to the mingled spirit is 2 Corinthians 4:13: And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In translating this verse, many versions of the Bible use a small letter s for the spirit, indicating our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One version, however, uses a capital letter S, indicating the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the Wuest translation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore M. R. Vincent, in his Word Studies in the New Testament, says concerning this verse: Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty of disposition, but blending both.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all know that blending is a synonym for mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So when we speak of staying in the spirit, we mean in the blended spirit, in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have a spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated, and the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit making the two one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the spirit in which we have to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can we remain in such a spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the time we have to, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The best way to keep you in your spirit and to save you from losing your temper is to O Lord.</S>
