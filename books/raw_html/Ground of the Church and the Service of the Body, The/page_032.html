	 <h2 class="head1">NOT ARGUING ABOUT SMALL MATTERS<br />
IN ORDER TO AVOID DAMAGING THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>We should not think that it is a small matter to argue about means of transportation. Actually, from the Lord&rsquo;s perspective everything we do today is small. If we are faithful over small matters, the Lord can eventually set us over more important matters (Matt. 25:21). Often we are severely tested and tried in regard to small matters. Satan often tests us using small matters. In the previous example, I might harbor a thought in my heart that the brothers are wasteful. Due to having a problem and a negative feeling within, I will be filled with the presence of the &ldquo;I.&rdquo; When I first began to serve the Lord, I was quite young. One day a senior co-worker fellowshipped with me regarding one point that I cannot forget. This one thing has become a help to me over the years. He said to me, &ldquo;Brother, we have risen up to serve the Lord because we have seen the light concerning the church. Hence, we should not serve the Lord in an organization.&rdquo; At that time we were willing to serve the Lord on a pure and clean ground; thus, we found a small place and began to meet there.</p>
<p>One day we were about to preach the gospel, and an argument arose among us. Why would people such as we who serve the Lord argue so much? Our argument was due to a small matter, that is, whether or not to close or open a certain door. The place we were renting was located next to a street with no walls to separate the houses from the street. The door of the rented place opened directly to the street. One party proposed that we should close the door during meeting time, but another party wanted to open the door so that it would be convenient for people to come and go. We were all brothers serving the Lord; nevertheless, we could not be one, because one side wanted to open the door, and the other side wanted to close the door.</p>
<p>During that time I went to the meeting hall almost every day. When I arrived at the hall, I would open the door and use two stools to hold the door open. After the meeting began and people started to trickle in, an elderly brother would immediately close the door. What he did caused me to feel uneasy within. Then one meeting would be finished, and after two hours the next meeting would begin. I would open the door again as I had done before, and soon afterward the same brother would close the door. The two of us did not have oneness in regard to this small thing; hence, we were divided over a small matter. This experience became a deep warning to me. Later, a senior co-worker rendered help to me; he said, &ldquo;Not only is that brother who closed the door fleshly; you too are fleshly. Actually, there is nothing worth arguing about in regard to opening or closing a door. Not only in small matters like this, but even in large matters, there is nothing worth arguing about.&rdquo; Can we not refrain from arguing with those with whom we serve in the church life? Only when we do not argue will we not offend God.</p>
<p>In contrast, if someone were to stand up and say, &ldquo;Jesus is not God,&rdquo; not only should we dispute this, but we should also speak to him in a strong way, saying, &ldquo;If you do not repent, I cannot serve the Lord together with you.&rdquo; Because this matter concerns the truth, it is not a small matter like opening or closing a door. In serving the Lord, we will encounter severe tests, particularly in regard to small things; Satan always hides himself in small matters in order to tempt us. Many times it is because of small things that the brothers are not in one accord. For instance, when the brothers go to visit the saints without one accord, one brother will agree only with his own way and another will simply do whatever he wants. In the end no one will do any visiting, and each will say, &ldquo;Forget about it. If you want to go, you go. But I will do it according to my way.&rdquo; Such discord is often not in regard to large matters but is related to small matters. Small matters are a serious test to the brothers and sisters and are the source of many of our problems.</p>
<p>When the responsible brothers say that it is time for us to preach the gospel, we may say, &ldquo;How can we preach the gospel when the spiritual atmosphere is so cold? We should do the work of edification first.&rdquo; We might think to ourselves, &ldquo;If they insist on preaching the gospel, they will surely fail.&rdquo; If one day their preaching proves to be a failure, we might say, &ldquo;Did I not tell you that this way does not work?&rdquo; Surely such speaking will satisfy our self and vindicate that our view is higher and our suggestions are better. However, we must remember that in this matter there is no right or wrong; neither is there a regulation or standard concerning how things should be done. We can preach the gospel first, or we can edify first. The Lord Jesus is our Savior. Regardless of whether we preach the gospel first or endeavor to edify the saints first, He will continue to be our Savior. If we preach the gospel now, He is the Savior, and if we preach the gospel two weeks later, He will still be the Savior. If you feel that you should preach the gospel, we thank and praise the Lord. If you feel that you should not, we also thank and praise the Lord. Whether we preach the gospel or not, we still need to come together and pray. Whenever we encounter a situation in which there is a dispute, if we pray together, the result will be that we will follow the Lord&rsquo;s feeling and allow the Lord&rsquo;s will to be carried out.</p>
