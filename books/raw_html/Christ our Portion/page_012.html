<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO BE NOURISHED BY THE LORD AS FOOD</h2><p>The fourth item of the enjoyment of Christ is the matter of food. As we turn to our spirit, we sense enlightenment, refreshment, and nourishment. While we are reading the Word, we must learn not to exercise our mind too much. If we exercise our mind too much when we read, we will be exhausted instead of being satisfied. We must learn to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, praying more than we read. As we do this we will sense that we are being nourished, satisfied, and strengthened, having something of Christ ministered into us. If we would practice this, I cannot tell you what kind of sweetness, preciousness, and richness we would enjoy! Many Christians do not have a time with the Lord, and many of those who desire to be with the Lord, do so in a wrong way. Many of these brothers and sisters study the Word and read it by exercising their mind too much. They do not know how to turn themselves to the spirit in order to touch the Lord and meet with Him. Learn to turn to the spirit. This is the only way to enjoy Christ as light, air, water, and food. If we learn to turn to our spirit, the whole church will be turned, and there will be a great change in the church life.<h2 class=head1>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS THE ABODE</h2><p>The last major item of the enjoyment in the spirit is Christ as our abode. It is only as you turn yourself to the spirit and remain there that you abide in Christ. To remain in the spirit is to abide in Christ. When you are abiding in Him and He is abiding in you (John 15:4-5), you have the sense that you are one with Him, mingled with Him. At this time you realize that He is the vine (John 15:1) and that you are one of the branches of the vine (15:5) enjoying all the richness, sweetness, and fatness of the vine tree. As the vine, He is everything to us. We are in Him and He is in us. We abide in Him, taking Him as our abode, and He abides in us to be the Dweller within us. What a wonderful life this is in oneness with Him! No human word can adequately explain this wonderful mystery. Our abiding in Him and His abiding in us are a mystery, yet this mutual abiding is a fact, a reality, to be experienced by us. Therefore, we must learn one thing and pay our full attention to this one thing, that is, to always turn back to the spirit. Whenever we turn to the spirit, we will be in light, we will have air, flowing water, nourishing food, and we will enjoy Christ as our abiding place, our abode. This is the proper way to enjoy Christ.
