   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A number of Christians may speak about the great love of God in Christ, but I am concerned that what they speak is not so thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If they were thorough in knowing God in His attributes in different levels, they would speak much about God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is because our day by day present situation does not match the level of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our real practical situation surely fits the lowest level of God's attributes, that is, God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's love and God's grace are on a higher level than His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has a heart loving us, and out of that heart God prepares a gift for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That gift is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we are not worthy of this gift, however, God has come down to reach us in His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His attribute of mercy, He can reach us on the lowest level.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Very few of God's children, however, realize that they need God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In my prayers in the early days of my being a Christian, I spoke about God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today after many years of experience, however, I trust in God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because my low situation does not match the high level of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may consider that we are ladies and gentlemen, but really we are "scorpions" and "gophers."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The people considered David as a high king, but he considered himself as a worm Psa 22:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why he told God that he needed His mercy 51:1; 52:8b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, David's very descendant would be the King of kings on this earth to be the sure mercies to the entire royal family of David.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mercies are somewhat like kindness and compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's mercies kindness and compassion , as the initiation of God's grace in His love, reach us the farthest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mercy is the initiation for God's grace to come in with God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's grace cannot be separated from His love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His mercies usher us into God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we get into grace, we have His love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's mercy reaches us the farthest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times in our experience we are far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are not so close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we need God's attribute of mercy to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jeremiah and Lamentations really show us the pitiful situation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God could not come to them in His love or in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God needed to exercise His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without mercy, He could not have reached His people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Jeremiah, the children of Israel at the time of the exile to Babylon were in a pitifully low situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is difficult to even describe how low their condition was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That was why God gave them up for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after seventy years, God came back to them in His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus came in mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He came in a very low level to have mercy upon the fallen Israelites, but most of them rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, the Lord cried for them and wept for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Matthew 23:37-38 the Lord said, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Behold, your house is left to you desolate!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord predicted that Jerusalem would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In reference to the buildings of the temple, He told the disciples, "Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down" 24:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus and the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Josephus, in his history, tells us of the terrible destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.</S>
