   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All physical things are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only Christ is real.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the real life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, in the eyes of God if you do not have Christ, you do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First John 5:12 says, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is also our real light and our real way John 1:4; 1 John 1:5; John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All visible physical things are not real; they are simply figures and shadows of the reality, which is Christ Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you need food to eat or a home in which to live?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is both of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you wish to receive a letter?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is even our letter 2 Cor 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you need clothing?</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you need a head?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is our Head Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, if you do not have Christ, you are a person without a head.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you desire philosophy?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is much more than philosophy Col 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can never exhaust all the items of what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is truly everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>OUR NEED TO APPLY CHRIST IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although Christ is everything, there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The problem is that although we have Christ within us, we do not apply Him in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have Christ, but when we are thinking about something, we do not think by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have Christ, but when we are going to do something, we do not do it by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have Christ, but when we speak with people, we do not speak by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This can be likened to owning a nice car but not knowing how to drive it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have received Christ into us, but we do not apply Christ to our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christians today often speak about doing what is right as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Day by day they seek the Lord for His will so that they can know what they should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of seeking, however, is short.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather than seeking simply to know whether or not we should do a particular thing, we need to ask, If I do this particular thing, will I be doing it alone, or will Christ be doing it with me?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is what we must endeavor to know.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we are engaged in a particular activity, we must check to determine who it is that is acting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are we acting alone, or is Christ acting in us and through us?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Galatians the apostle Paul testified, saying, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may often inquire, Lord, is this right for me to do? but we should also check to see whether we are acting by ourselves or whether it is Christ who is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One day a young brother asked me, Brother Lee, why do some say that Christians should not go to movies?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In response to his question, I did not give him a long answer; I simply asked him, When you go to a movie, does Christ go with you?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The young brother answered me, Of course, Christ does not go with me to the movie.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let alone going to movies, I would also ask, when we go to preach the gospel, who is the person who is going to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do we go by ourselves to preach the gospel, or is Christ within us the One who is going to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we visit another saint, do we visit that saint alone, or does Christ within us do it in us and with us?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In other words, when we are doing all the things that we do in our daily life, do we truly apply Christ in what we are doing?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we have the revelation that Christ is everything to us, we will check.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Day by day, moment by moment, and in whatever we are doing, we will check to see whether or not what we are doing is Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We will check to see whether or not we are applying Christ in everything we do.</S>
