<p>From now on we need to strive and push toward the goal of taking the lead well, being apt to teach, and prophesying well. The young people should never have differences of opinion or live according to their moods. Instead, they should go on steadily in the church life. I co-labored with Brother Nee for eighteen years. May the Lord cover me with His blood; in those eighteen years I never expressed any opinion to Brother Nee. He used to turn toward me in the co-workers&rsquo; meetings and ask, &ldquo;Brother Witness, what do you think?&rdquo; I would smile and not say a word. I maintained an attitude of obedience because I was not taking the lead. I simply obeyed; I did whatever he wanted me to do, and I went wherever he wanted me to go. This was my attitude. In those eighteen years, I never voiced an opinion. Furthermore, all the messages I spoke in those eighteen years were Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages. I would even tell the saints the year in which Brother Nee had released the message that I was speaking. I never considered it a shame to speak Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages; on the contrary, I was proud of it. I am not exaggerating. In January of 1934, after I heard ten messages in a conference in Shanghai, I went back to Chefoo, and by June I had repeated those ten messages. This was how closely I followed Brother Nee in the past.</p>
<p>Today the most damaging things to the Lord&rsquo;s work in His recovery are opinions and gossip. These things are a big shame to us. Once we have differences in opinion and live according to our moods, it will be difficult for us to continue on in the Lord&rsquo;s way. We all need to learn to be without opinion. A person who is not taking the lead should obey the directions he receives, and one who takes the lead should provide directions. If we can neither give directions nor follow directions, we are through. I have had many experiences of riding in people&rsquo;s cars. I have learned not to say anything when a brother is driving. I do not say to go north or south, to turn right or left, or to go fast or slow. The only exception occurred when a brother and I drove from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in the middle of the night during the winter. The brother fell asleep while driving, and upon seeing it, I needed to remind him that for our safety he should not fall asleep. Often people express many opinions while riding in the cars of other people. This makes it difficult for the drivers.</p>
<p>I hope that all the elders and co-workers will avoid expressing different opinions in the work. If all the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones avoid expressing their opinions, the churches will be blessed. Where there is opinion, there the church is through; even if the opinion is the greatest and brightest, it is still useless. This can be compared to a chemical experiment; opinion is like the corrupting factor in the experiment. No matter where this factor is added, the experiment is ruined. Hence, whether we are co-workers, elders, or young full-timers, we need to realize that when we serve together, we need to learn to have no opinion. Ahead of us is only one goal. All the elders and co-workers should not have any opinion when they go back to their localities. Instead, they should take the lead well, teach well, and prophesy well. They should also endeavor to labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word, pray much, pursue the truth, and seek the Lord Himself. Moreover, they need to have close and intimate fellowship with the Lord and live in spirit so that the Lord can give them light and revelation at any time. In this way, they will be able to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, and to speak forth the Lord, thereby bringing in great blessings for the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
