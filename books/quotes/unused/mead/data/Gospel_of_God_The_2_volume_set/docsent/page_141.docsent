   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although the Word of God is abundantly clear, there are still those who like to argue against it.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They insist that confession is the way to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I wish to ask them, "If so, what will you do with Romans 10:8: 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart'?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here it says the word of faith, not the word of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Scriptures say "believe."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not say "confess."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6 says, "But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 6 speaks of the righteousness out of faith, and verse 8, the word of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is one confession in verse 9 and another in verse 10.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both confessions are with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, verse 11 does not say, "Everyone who confesses Him shall not be put to shame."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, it says, "Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must recognize the emphasis here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 6, 8, and 11 mention "believe," and verses 9 and 10 mention "confess."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 9 first says "confess" and then "believe"; whereas in verse 10 it is first "believe" and then "confess."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this one portion "believe" is used five times and "confess" twice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the end, the order of "confess" and "believe" is reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All this signifies that salvation should be due to faith and not to confession.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Confession issues from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What one believes in his heart, he utters spontaneously with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person will spontaneously say "daddy" when he sees his father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where there is faith, confession follows immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The end of verse 12 shows us that confession here is the confession of Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This confession comes from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may not see this from verses 1 through 11.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But verse 12 says, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 13 says, "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Calling upon the Lord's name is equivalent to the confessing of the Lord Jesus in the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To call on the name of the Lord is to confess Jesus as Lord, to call Him Lord, and to address Him as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By taking care of the context of this passage, we will realize that calling is simply confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 14 says, "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a wonderful word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It shows that calling comes out of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Naturally, no one can call without believing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can see that confessing with the mouth results from faith in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because a man believes in his heart, he calls with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He calls because he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you see this fact?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything issues from faith; faith is the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although it mentions confession with the mouth, this confession is based upon faith in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is natural for those who believe to call.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe tonight we are all saved ones who have received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May I ask how you have received Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We received Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Did you also pray?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Salvation is due to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Prayer is the expression of this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone in the world is saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this faith is expressed in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Faith is within and prayer is without.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you believe in your heart that Jesus is the Savior, spontaneously you will pray with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whoever believes in his heart will confess with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we must always remember that confession is not the way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the word says "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," yet calling is not the way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The reason is that calling comes from faith; it is a spontaneous action, something uttered before God spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us come back to verse 12: "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I love the phrase, "There is no distinction."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Romans 3:22 and 23 say, "Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For all have sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here it says, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Each one must call upon the Lord, confess with his mouth, and believe in his heart before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord be gracious to us and show us that the only way of salvation in the Bible is faith and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Salvation is not by faith plus law-keeping, good works, repentance, confession, or prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the scriptural truth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to stand upon the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible reveals clearly to us that the way of salvation is faith alone.</S>
