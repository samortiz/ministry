Besides our experience and enjoyment of Christ, nothing is more crucial and vital than the meetings of the church
Its contents unveil in a new and fresh way the biblical revelation concerning the gathering together of God's people
Eventually, God's leading and guiding brought the children of Israel to God's habitation, the tabernacle and later the temple
The tabernacle and temple typify Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God , as the dwelling place of God on this earth
When the children of Israel gathered together in oneness, both God and His people were fully satisfied with Christ
Our experience today of these glorious types is made real and realized by our enjoyment of Christ as the Spirit of reality
We pray that the following pages of this book with its clear vision will become a revelation to all who read them
God and all the saints are satisfied with Christ, and God has His living testimony and expression on the earth through His church
Lord, even open up our sober mind that we all may see something on Your heart, that we may see something according to Your plan
As you can see from the title of the message, what we would say is not something so usual concerning the meetings
Most of you, after thinking a little bit, might say that the meeting life began from Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost
In Exodus when God's salvation was brought in, right away there was the demand of the assembly of God's people
They enjoyed the eating by the assembling, but they did this not only for themselves, but mainly unto the Lord
If you study the book of Acts carefully you will see that all the people who were saved on the day of Pentecost stuck themselves together
Of course, in those days they met nearly the whole day and every day, and whenever they met that was a testimony of the victory
It was a testimony of Christ's victory in them over the enemy, over Satan, over the world, over all the demons!
The first point of the new light concerning the meetings is this: the meeting life of God's people began in Exodus
When they assembled at Mount Sinai that meant a victory over Pharaoh, over Egypt, over Satan, over all his demons!
Today the church meetings are an exhibition of the victory of Christ over all the demons and the Devil in all of us
Of course, some of the neighbors were bothered by the shoutings, the rejoicings, the singings, so they called the police to complain
The police told those complaining neighbors that before the church came this area was terrible and even horrible
Close to three hundred saints lived right around the hall, and there were more than this coming to the meetings
When the children of Israel got released from Egypt and met at Mount Sinai, don't you believe that they rejoiced?
Eventually this man fell into Egypt where he was altogether under Pharaoh's tyranny, having no freedom and no God
If the attendance of a local church is low, this is a sign that the saints do not realize and enjoy the victory of Christ so much
You come with the expectation that you can have a time to give a testimony that Christ today has defeated the enemy in you
You just consider every night how many gatherings, how many congregations, how many meetings, how many assemblies the fallen people have
In every place there is the need of some proper Christian assembly that can constitute a testimony of the victory of Christ
The Lord Jesus' words were to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you
The recovery of the Lord must have a front to declare the enjoyment of Christ and the participation in the victory of Christ
These two things-the enjoyment of Christ and the participation in the victory of Christ-brought them into the feast
In the Old Testament type you have God's dwelling place typified by the tent, the tabernacle, as the center of God's gathered people
You have to realize without the gathering together of the believers in their locality, there is no practical church life
The tent signifies God's dwelling place; the meetings signify the gathering, the coming together, of all the saints
When the children of Israel were traveling through the wilderness, there was the pillar of cloud or of fire always taking the lead
In our Christian pilgrimage, in our Christian course or journey, the Lord is always taking the lead, and at the same time He is guiding us
The leading only took the people on the way, but the guiding took them to a particular point, that is, God's holy habitation
It is not just a kind of service or a kind of worship or a kind of coming together to have a Bible study or a prayer time
According to God's understanding and in God's view, all of the children of Israel were planted on that mountain
Whether they are dancing, or surfing, or playing ball, or eating, or drinking, or gambling, or stealing, they are miserable
Sometimes due to your subjective personal problems you brought your miserable situation from your home to the meetings
God charged the children of Israel that after they entered into the good land, they should not come together at just any place
When the psalmist thought about certain matters, it was painful for him, but when he went into the sanctuary of God he began to understand
A number of times when we just came into the meeting, the thing we were seeking to know became very clear to us
Of course, many times the testimonies helped us to be clear, and even more times the message helped us to be clear
Anyhow we all can testify that the best place and the best time for us to know God's will is when we come to the meeting
Too many times we prayed concerning things again and again, seeking to know the Lord's will, but we failed to get clear
If you meet properly like the children of Israel did and you don't have a job, then the Lord might send the manna to you
You would begin to go back to that miserable life under Satan's tyranny from which you have been delivered already
It will come not only to you, one generation, but perhaps even to the third generation, or generation after generation
If we had only the New Testament, we could not know the church so much as we can through Eve as a type of the church
In the next book, Exodus, the tabernacle was not only a type of Christ but also a type of the corporate Christ, that is, the church
The ark within the tabernacle was a type of the individual Christ, but the tabernacle was a type of the corporate Christ, the church
Just by reading or studying the New Testament, you surely cannot see adequately how the Christians should meet
Of all, in Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that, where two or three are gathered together in His name, He was in the midst
On the one hand my wedding day was very pleasant but compared with the meeting days, there was a different flavor
If you read Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and Deuteronomy you could realize that in the whole universe there is a divine hunger
If you know the Bible you could see that whenever the burnt offering was being burnt on the altar, God was enjoying, and He was satisfied
A part was for God's food and a part was for the offerer's food, and another part was for the ministering priests' food
When we get into Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in our life-study we will get into the details of all these offerings
Whenever you come to the meeting you must have a deep realization that you have come to the meeting with Christ
If all of us would offer a short praise, a short prayer, a short testimony, there would not be sufficient time in the meeting
We come to the meeting with Christ to present Him to God and man that the meeting might be so living, so rich, and so uplifted
Of course, this is not wrong, but this is altogether from the human point of view concerning a religious meeting
The book of Acts didn't charge the newly saved ones to meet together, but they gathered spontaneously every day
You can see how that the New Testament with its clear teaching in plain words needs the Old Testament picture to illustrate it
In 1935 about seven or eight co-workers and myself stayed with Brother Watchman Nee at the famous Western Lake
Abel was the first priest because he offered the proper sacrifice to satisfy God, through which he was accepted by God
To do the priestly service to God, just to bring what God wants, to bring what can please God and satisfy God to God as God's food
For them to meet was to gather together into the name of God and into the habitation of God to offer food to God and to serve God with food
At least you have one book in the New Testament, Hebrews, which gives us a lot of interpretations of the Old Testament books
Also the writer in Hebrews indicated clearly that he didn't have the time to give us the full interpretation of the Pentateuch
We should not believe that because they were not touched by the New Testament writers, they mean nothing to us
It was around 1959 that the Lord showed us that even the land of Canaan was a rich and all-inclusive type of Christ
All the tithes, all the firstborn ones, all the firstfruits brought to Mount Zion to present to God are Christ
How much Christ you bring to the meeting depends upon how much Christ you produce, how much Christ you have grown
He sanctified us by washing away all our dirt, by covering our nakedness, by redeeming us, and by filling us outwardly and inwardly
The washing water is Christ, the clothing is Christ, the redeeming is Christ, and the filling up is also Christ
If Aaron had been altogether victorious, altogether clean and pure, then he would not have needed the sin offering
Don't forget that when the children of Israel came together, they firstly needed the sin offering and the trespass offering
In the past messages we have seen that the worship God desires is for us to offer Christ to Him in the meetings
In Matthew 18 there is the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Old Testament there is the name of Jehovah your God
For God to put His name in a place means that God Himself is there, so that place becomes a place where God dwells
After the burnt offering you have the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
When you speak of resurrection, you may not have the ascension, but when you speak of the ascension, resurrection is also included
Just as the burnt offering includes all of the following offerings so the heave offering includes the foregoing offering
The burnt offering is the leading one of the main offerings, and the heave offering is one of the subordinate offerings
The vow means you like to give something more than what is required by the government because you are so patriotic
The offerings for the vow are stronger, and the tithe was even much stronger because that was to fulfill a requirement
If you have the fear of the Lord surely you will come to the meetings regularly, and when you come, you will surely offer Christ
If you are invited by a certain brother to his home for dinner by six oclock and you arrive at seventen this means you dont respect the host
If the government of a country is just a mess it might not make much difference whether you pay tax or not; perhaps nobody would bother you
What they produced from laboring on the good land was of two kingdoms: the vegetable kingdom and the animal kingdom
The land is Christ not yet labored on; the seed is Christ not yet sown into the land; the produce is Christ labored on, sown, and reaped
We live by the very Christ whom we labor on and whom we have sown into the good land and who now becomes our produce
Every day we enjoy Christ as the life supply, and we live by the anointing oil, and we die by pouring out our life
In this message we need to consider how to have Christ increased that we may offer Him in the meeting as so many different offerings
According to Leviticus chapters one, two, and six the first offering among the five basic offerings is the burnt offering
The sequence in these chapters is firstly the burnt offering, and then lastly the two offerings for sin and the trespass
It says that you have to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks
The tithe here indicates the ten percent of all the produce of the things from the field, including the wheat, the oil, and the wine
In Deuteronomy 12:6 there is a clear word concerning the groceries from the animal kingdom-the herds and the flocks
We have to realize that the tithes of the vegetables are not good for burnt offerings or for sin offerings or for trespass offerings
From the vegetable kingdom the groceries are good for the meal offering for the last part of the peace offering and for the drink offering
Even for the real practice of the offerings such as the sanctification of the priests, they firstly had to offer the sin offering
With some of the sin offerings there was nothing to eat for the priest or for the people who offered the offerings
The burning outside the camp was not a burning to send a sweet odor up to God but a burning of judgment, a burning of abandonment
You take a shower once in the morning, but you may wash your hands many times during the day as they become dirty
Because you offered Christ as your sin offering early in the morning you would be reminded that you are a sinner
You are not still under ignorance, because you fully realize that you are sin and that every day you need Christ to redeem you
Rather, offer something according to the rich typology of the Word, offering Christ as all the offerings to God
If you live a life every day in such a practice, you will be so rich with Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering
Especially at the Lord's table you will appreciate and see the Lord as your sin offering and as your trespass offering
At the table meeting you will enjoy the Lord as a big bullock, so adequate for your sin and for your trespass offering
Because we are void of the experience of Christ we have the kind of heart to come to the meeting again and again with empty hands
In Deuteronomy and Exodus in the typologies there are not only the doctrinal things but also the experiential things
We have to see that these are the real contents of the Lord's recovery, and this is the reality of the contents of the Lord's recovery
Let us go on to learn something and to enter into a new field and to practice what the Lord has been showing us in these days
2 Corinthians 5:21 says that Christ was made sin, not sins, for us that we may become the righteousness of God in Him
Four of the verses refer to Christ as the sin offering, and four of the verses refer to Christ as the trespass offering
What is the difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering if the trespass offering can eventually become the sin offering?
How could it be that of the two pieces of the trespass offering, one becomes a sin offering and the other becomes a burnt offering?
Have you noticed also that with every kind of trespass offering, there is the mentioning that it is the sin offering?
From verse 14 you have the trespass offering for the trespass in the holy things such as sacrifices offered to God
How could the vegetable life without blood be used for a trespass offering which eventually becomes the sin offering?
Of the two pigeons or the two turtledoves for the trespass offering, one becomes the sin offering and the other becomes the burnt offering
There is the sin offering for the priests, and secondly, there is the sin offering for the congregation of the people, for the nation
Also, at that time there are a lot of other senses and a lot of other realizations within you concerning Christ
Right away at least half of what you have offered to the Lord as the trespass offering becomes a burnt offering
You might wonder why the Bible needs to have a difference, to use two expressions: sin offering and trespass offering
If you don't realize this in such a thorough way it indicates that your offering of Christ as the trespass offering is not absolute
Now we come to the weakest and the smallest of the trespass offerings, the one tenth of an ephah of fine flour
Why wouldn't you stand before the window and let thoughts concerning Christ's loveliness, His greatness, His beauty go through your mind?
According to Leviticus 5:11-13 the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour, which, of course, has no blood, could be offered for a sin offering
Other teachers have said that the Hebrew word for trespass or trespass offering is a derivation from the Hebrew word that means be guilty
Not only in the writing of the Bible are there complications, but also even in our experiences we have many complications
The difference is this: with Adam the committing of sin was unique, but with us the committing of sin is not unique
You have to realize that these few chapters on the offerings are not written based only upon God's requirement
You can see that this portion is written according to the Lord's requirements and also based upon our experiences
So many of us could not afford to offer a bullock or a ram or a lamb or even two little birds for the shedding of the blood
These few chapters also show us that we as God's redeemed people all have different sizes of our appreciation of the Lord Jesus
Whether Christ to you is a bull or a lamb or a turtledove or some amount of fine flour all depends upon your appreciation
The majority of Christians mainly consider one aspect of Christ, that is, His humanity which is so fine and so good
Most believers do not appreciate the Lord as such a laboring and sacrificing bullock so much as being a man so perfect and fine
We surely need to have a revolutionary change first in our concept then in our appreciation then in our experience and then in our meetings
With this as a foundation, we can understand how a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a trespass offering could become a sin offering
The way for Christ to accomplish the redemption for our sin was absolutely according to God's unique requirement
Whether you come with a handful of fine flour or you come with a big bullock, God would forgive you because of that name
Even though in your prayer you may mention the blood again and again, it may actually occupy very little space
We all have to realize that in the Old Testament typology there are three main categories: the tabernacle, the offerings, and the priests
The tabernacle is one category of types showing how that Christ came with God to give us a way to enter into God
These illustrations show us that many of the spiritual things are the same in principle as the physical things
The tabernacle mainly signifies that God was available for you to experience, not for you to enjoy and not for you to take in
As the tabernacle God is available for you to enter into Him, but He is not available for you to take Him into you
If you eat something of life, something organic, it will be digested and assimilated, and it will saturate your being
People's eyes have been blinded and covered by the natural thought, by the religious teachings, and by the traditional theology
Christ is our tabernacle, Christ is the offerings as our food, and Christ is also our Priest preparing the food
It seems too difficult for us to offer Christ as the trespass offering as the sin offering as the burnt offering and all the other offerings
He said that if you would teach the Bible or you would teach people to sing, you must go to a seminary to study and become a specialist
He said we should not ask the common believers to offer a prayer because they have never learned to do this properly
You have to know how to enter into the Holy Place where you handle the showbread table and where you dress the lampstand
There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
According to the clear word in Hebrews 109 and according to the prophecies in Psalm 40 He was a Person who lived His life absolutely for God
Because of this He was qualified to be our sin offering to deal with our sin and to take away our sins which we inherited by birth
Christ as our sin offering is supported by Himself as our burnt offering, as One who lived a life so absolutely for God
We need One who in His human life was perfect, balanced, fine, One with whom nothing was rough or tough or coarse
When you apply Christ as your trespass offering, at first you may not realize the matter of Christ as the meal offering
Gradually you will begin to realize there are so many defects and mistakes and imperfections and transgressions in your daily walk
Perhaps you have been born again for twenty-five years and growing in the Lord, yet you realize that you are still sinful
You would realize that He is so absolute for God, so He is qualified to deal with your sin and even with your nature
His perfection in His human living qualifies Him to deal with our trespasses and His absoluteness for God qualifies Him to deal with our sin
The first two offerings the burnt offering and the meal offering support the last two offerings the sin offering and the trespass offering
Romans 8:3 says that, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
Darby in his notes on Romans 8:3 indicates that the phrase 'for sin' refers to a sacrifice for sin or a sin offering
In Romans 8 the dealing is with sin, not with the sins in our behavior, but the very sin in our flesh and nature
You will realize that Christ is your burnt offering for the sin offering and that Christ is your meal offering for the trespass offering
Also a part of the peace offering which is offered for sin and a trespass offering is burned on the altar as a burnt offering
If you spend some time to cover all the sixtysix books of the Bible you can pick up many wonderful nouns and terms and names ascribed to God
Although it may be difficult for us to understand the difference between glory and virtue, He is these two items to us
We have the enjoyment of such a God who is processed, who is triune, who is all-inclusive, who is indwelling, who is the Spirit
We would need either some bishops or pastors or ministers or preachers or elders or leading ones to take care of the meetings
According to the types in the Old Testament, we can see clearly that no one is qualified in himself to enter into the tabernacle
He was such a brass serpent lifted up on the tree, that is, on the cross to nail the old serpent, Satan, to the cross
In chapter three as the brass serpent, He nailed Satan, the old serpent, the source of all the problems, on the cross
We come to the cross taking Him as our sin offering and our trespass offering with the intention of entering into the tabernacled God
It had so many items of furniture, including the showbread table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar
The sin offering always directs us to the burnt offering, and the burnt offering is always reflected in the sin offering
When we realize that we have sin in our nature, that our being is just sin, then we realize that we need the Lord Jesus as our sin offering
By this kind of prayer you offer Christ as your sin offering to God, and at the same time you participate in Him as your burnt offering
The sin offering directs us to the burnt offering, and the burnt offering is always reflected in the sin offering
If you offered Christ as your sin offering this morning, you surely realized that the Lord Jesus is also your burnt offering
You have a sweet sensation in you that you are acceptable to God not because of what you are, but because of Him and because of what He is
There is the food supply of the cakes and the wafers, and there is also the blood of the sin offering and trespass offering
There is the burnt offering with the fat and the inwards which had to be burned on the altar as an offering by fire as a sweet savor to God
As the fine flour you should not only be anointed with the oil, but you should also be mingled with the oil and even soaked with the oil
Even if these four things are taken care of, but you don't have a fellowshipping enjoyment with one another, you are still short of peace
Christians today do not have the proper meetings because they have not enjoyed Christ adequately as the peace offering
As we take Him as our trespass offering at the same time we realize how perfect He is how fine He is how balanced He is how complete He is
The accomplishment of the sin offering was once for all, but to apply what the Lord Jesus is and has accomplished is a daily matter
As we continue the messages on the meetings, we need to consider once again the picture of the tabernacle with all the offerings
Surely the record concerning the tabernacle and all the offerings shows us clearly that the Bible is the divine revelation of God
If all these things had not been revealed by God, how could Moses have had such an excellent mentality to design such a thing?
No philosopher has ever said something like what is revealed in the Bible concerning the tabernacle and the offerings
From God's end coming to us there is the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
As you go on you will realize that not only do you have trespasses outwardly, but you also have even sin inwardly
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God, and this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us
In this wonderful talk the tabernacle indicated to him, a teacher of the Old Testament, that he surely should know what Moses did
At one time Moses lifted up a brass serpent on a pole because the children of Israel had been bitten by poisonous serpents in the wilderness
Because the children of Israel were bitten by serpents, they needed a serpent to be judged on the pole on their behalf
The next verse, 3:15, says, 'That every one who believes in Him may have eternal life,' that is, to be made alive
Corinthians 5:21 says that 'Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him'
In the Gospel of John the tabernacle traveled from that old man in Judea to a thirsty, immoral woman in Samaria
The Lord's intention, the tabernacle's intention, was to attract her to enter into the tabernacle, to enter into Himself
When she asked that the Lord would give her the living water, He said to her, 'Go, call your husband and come here'
When Adam was bitten there in the garden, Nicodemus was also bitten, and that poisonous nature was in Nicodemus
His talk with her was to help her realize that she had a lot of trespasses so she needed the One who was perfect to be her trespass offering
After nine cases had been covered up through chapter eleven, in chapter twelve they were enjoying Christ as their peace offering
Grace is just the incarnated God to be your sin offering, your trespass offering, your burnt offering, your meal offering
As long as they made such a thorough confession of their trespasses, they enjoyed the Lord as the trespass offering
The entire Bible of sixty-six books shows us a complete picture composed with the tabernacle, many offerings, and a high priest
In the Old Testament the central item of the history of the children of Israel was the tabernacle and later on the temple
It is not a small thing that firstly God would come to the earth to dwell among man and secondly that man can enter into Gods dwelling place
For us, the fallen human race, to enter into God Himself as our dwelling place to abide with God is too great!
He has to be our sin offering our trespass offering our burnt offering our meal offering and eventually allinclusively our peace offering
Some have been Christians for years and yet have not realized that our Savior is composed of all these offerings
The entire Bible portrays just one matter: that the Second of the Godhead, the Second of the Trinity, the Son of God, became tabernacled
John 1:1 and 14 tell us clearly that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God and this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and this Word became flesh, and this flesh was the tabernacle!
In the New Testament the singular sin indicates something deeper within our nature, not just our outward conduct
A number of the different versions of the Bible use a paragraph sign between these two verses, indicating that verse 16 is a new beginning
Verse 14 says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
The Lord Jesus came as the tabernacle among people, but if He had never been lifted up on the cross, He could never be grace to us
If He had only been incarnated to be the tabernacle and was abiding among men, but had not been crucified, He could not be grace to us
It portrays how God Himself became a man to tabernacle among men and how He in the flesh became all the offerings
Outside he was a gentleman and perfect, but inside he had a serpentine nature, so the Lord Jesus told him that he needed to be born again
Because he didn't understand rightly, the Lord Jesus explained to him that to be born again is to be born of the water and of the Spirit
He told Moses to lift a brass serpent up on a pole and whosoever would look upon that brass serpent would live
The only way to have another life is by Jesus Christ who died on the cross in the form of a serpent to terminate your serpentine being
The Lord agreed with her that she did not have a husband but He said that she had had five already and that the one she had now was not hers
The Lord presented Himself to her as the trespass offering, while He presented Himself to Nicodemus as the sin offering
These verses show us that Christ is not only the sin offering and the trespass offering, but also the burnt offering
He is not only the sin offering for sinners and the trespass offering for trespassers, but He is also the burnt offering for God Himself
When the Pharisee asked why they had not brought Him, the deputies answered, 'No man ever spoke as this man speaks'
The sin offering is here, the trespass offering is here, the burnt offering is here, and the meal offering is here
Oh, we do partake of such a Christ who is all the offerings-the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and meal offering
The initial fulfillment is in chapter twelve, where there was a feast prepared in the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus
The consummate fulfillment of the peace offering was after His resurrection, after He was offered to God as every kind of offering
When He met with His disciples after His resurrection, that meeting was a feast, and that feast was a peace offering
From that time on, even up until today, whenever we believers meet together with the resurrected Christ as our peace, we have a feast
When we meet together we offer Christ as our sin offering, as our trespass offering, as our burnt offering, and as our meal offering
Eventually when all the offerings are added together, we also enjoy the peace offering for our satisfaction and also for His satisfaction
Today we are enjoying the initial tabernacle, but in Revelation 21 and 22 there is the ultimate tabernacle of God among men
Between chapter twelve and chapter fourteen there is chapter thirteen with the laver for the washing of your feet
Every day, again and again, we have to lay our hands upon Christ, taking Him as our sin offering and as our trespass offering
By taking Him as these two offerings we will be reminded of how lovely He is how dear He is how precious He is how absolute He is toward God
We can say this based upon verse 29, which says, 'Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world'!
Those disciples and the Lord Jesus who were together in that house enjoying the feast were enjoying the peace offering
They had enjoyed the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering
According to Exodus 30:17-21 the laver is for washing the hands and the feet to prepare you to enter into the tabernacle
You have to forget about your traditional inheritance that told you 'My Father's house' was a big heavenly mansion
In chapter two the Lord Jesus told the Jews that if they destroyed this temple, He would rebuild it within three days
He was, of course, referring to His physical body which was the tabernacle and the temple of God, even the Father's house
In the Epistles we are told that the church is the house of God , and we are told that the church corporately is the temple
Verse 23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
At the time that the King James Version of the Bible was translated, the word mansion did equal the word abode
Today when people read the King James Version, they understand the word mansion according to the modern connotation
They consider that the Lord Jesus went to the heavens after His resurrection to prepare a big mansion for them
At that time He breathed into them and told them to receive the Holy Pneuma, the Holy Breath, that is, the Holy Spirit
In chapter fifteen He went on to tell His disciples that they should abide in Him, and that He would abide in them
Eventually, you realize that Christ is not only your sin offering and your trespass offering, but also your abiding place
The Son is the embodiment of the Father, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and we are the expression of the Triune God
Once you take food in, it is digested and assimilated into your blood and into your cells and even into your fibers
The Father becomes your abode, and eventually in chapter fifteen there is the mutual abiding with the mutual abode
The laver is in chapter thirteen and following this are three chapters which are a full description and a full portrait of the tabernacle
The Father has given all the chosen ones as a gift to the Son, that the Son may give the Father's life to them
The Bible does contain teachings and doctrines, but the teachings and doctrines convey the riches of God's Person
He shows them that the church life is not to express how much they know, nor some kind of authority, nor anything else
He wants to bring us all into this kind of glorifying situation, to glorify the Son that the Son may glorify the Father
We will arrive at the incense altar where we will be one with Christ to pray the kind of prayer that is recorded in John 17
Most Christian meetings today are mainly either traditional, natural, religious, or just according to people's taste
For such a feasting-meeting before God and with God-there is the need of two things: a dwelling place and the offerings
According to the picture presented in Exodus, while they were in the wilderness, the children of Israel were either traveling or camping
As they were camping in the wilderness, they spent much time to build a wonderful tabernacle with all its furniture and utensils
The main offerings, of course, were the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
The subordinate offerings were the wave offering, the heave offering, the drink offering, the vows, and the free-will offerings
The third crucial point we have covered is that Christ, the incarnated God, is both the tabernacle and the offerings
One book in the New Testament, the Gospel of John, points out that the incarnated God, Christ, is the tabernacle
According to these verses God is so solid for us to enter into, but there is the need of some bridging instruments, the offerings
On the one hand there is the tabernacle which is Christ, and on the other hand there is the Lamb of God indicating Christ as the offerings
In chapter eight the Lord Jesus spoke of reality again: 'And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free'
Once electricity is installed into a building, you simply need to be taught where the switches are and what they operate
Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, but without Christ becoming the Spirit, these are vain teachings
On that day, the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, and they were in the Lord, and the Lord was in them
When He became such a Spirit, this Spirit is the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings
The Word which was God, firstly became flesh, and this One, through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit
We do things, we say things, we act, we move, we walk, we do everything mainly in ourselves, by ourselves, and with ourselves
He is your trespass offering, your sin offering, your peace offering, your meal offering, and your burnt offering
If you would practice this daily you would experience the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings
Eventually you will be one with Christ at the incense altar to pray the prayer which He offered to the Father in John 17
