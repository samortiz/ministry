   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO TEACH THE SAINTS BY THE TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to fellowship how to teach the saints by the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must use the Lord s Day or what is popularly called Sunday since this day is generally a holiday throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people do not have to work on Sunday, so we must utilize this day to teach the truths to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must take this way to educate the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would propose that every church spend half of every Lord s Day on the matter of teaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every Lord s Day morning we may have a general meeting to take care of the Sunday goers and general attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time and on the same day, if possible in the same building, you must set up classes to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The best way is to ask the saints to register for the level they would like to be in based upon their discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they come to the meeting the next week, they should go to the level they have signed up for.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they have some new ones with them, they could bring them to the general meeting, and then they themselves could go to the particular class for which they have registered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same building you could have four classes to teach the truth and a general meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is a need, you could set up a gospel preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Use the entire morning of the Lord s Day to teach the saints the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The general meeting also comprises a part of the teaching of the truth in a kind of preaching way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The saints who are the interested seekers of the truth and who are not merely the Sunday goers have to get themselves registered into different levels of the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The leading ones should set up classes and arrange to have some teachers for these classes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the best way to promote the function of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a certain locality there may only be fifty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But they could be divided into two or three classes for the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Each class needs one teacher with a helper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may have thirty or more in one class, and the teaching of the lesson should only occupy fifty to sixty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the teaching of the lesson, the class should be divided into small groups of no more than ten.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The less in the small group the better.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Two saints are needed to take care of each group.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They need to sit down with the members of the group to discuss the lesson which they have all covered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no need for a detailed discussion, but these two saints should check with the ones in the group to find out what they understood and to give them time to ask some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They need to help the ones in the group to become more impressed with all the points of the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One truth lesson covers many points, so there is no time to develop a point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One particular teacher of a truth class spent a lot of time in one lesson discussing Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After he finished this discussion, much of the time was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Life-study messages are full of the expounding and development of particular points.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we came to the matter of the pillar in Genesis, we spent a number of messages to develop this point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the truth lessons are another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every lesson is really a message.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should teach the students in the class by first asking them to open up their copy of the truth lessons and read.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every member of the class can read a phrase or a sentence of the text in a spontaneous and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They should not read the lesson in the same way that they would read a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While they read the teacher should stress the main points to impress them with the contents of that lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You do not need to explain, expound, or develop.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If someone asks you who Cain is, it is sufficient to tell them that he was the first son of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not go further.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone would continue to ask you something else, you may need to say, That is not in the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The lesson is quite limited to impress us with all the major points.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the teaching of the truth lessons there is no chance for the one who teaches to show how much he knows.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is only charged to speak this message as a lesson with all the people in the class.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that in approximately fifty minutes a teacher can do a good job to impress the ones in his class with the truth of the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The questions at the end of each truth lesson are for discussion after the lesson is given.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not for homework.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The students need to be impressed with the points covered in that one lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only go as far as the text of the truth lessons with the accompanying questions to impress the saints with the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a math teacher in elementary school is teaching students addition, he does not go beyond his lesson to get into something deeper or higher.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, he breaks the teaching principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the first lesson only requires the students to add the first four numbers, the teacher should just impress them with that much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the best way of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not talk about anything other than what the lesson teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not add anything that would cause them to forget what they should be impressed with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just impress them with the very things that the lesson teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then you are a good teacher.</S>
