   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Having Wrestled against the Spiritual</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Power of Wickedness in the Heavenlies</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is what Paul meant when in Ephesians 6:12 he spoke of wrestling, not with flesh and blood, but with principalities, powers, and spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These powers are Satan s angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan is a usurping, self-enthroned king.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Under him, there are many angels who are the princes, the principalities, and authorities in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the Bible, the principalities, powers, and authorities under Satan, rule over the countries on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, Daniel 10:20 speaks of the prince of Persia and the prince of Grecia.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All heathen countries are under the ruling of these satanic princes in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Daniel chapter ten, Daniel prayed for three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although he was burdened to pray, he did not receive an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, a heavenly visitor said to Daniel, From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days Dan 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This heavenly one had been sent to Daniel, but he was frustrated by the prince of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, as Daniel 10:13 continues, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ancient Persia and Greece both were under principalities in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The nation of Israel, however, was not under a satanic prince, but under Michael, the defender of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While Daniel was praying those three weeks, a war was raging in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would be the overcomers, the stronger part of the woman, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the rumors, criticisms, and opposition do not come from any human beings, but from Satan, who is behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you pray like this, you are qualified to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not spend time dealing with your temper or your besetting sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These things are little bugs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, tell Satan, Satan, I have been distracted for years with paying attention to my temper and to my besetting sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But now I shall pass this on to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I will not pay attention to these things, but I will pay attention to preaching to you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I don t have the time to pray about my temper, but I do have the time to give you another sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all have been deceived, saying, Oh, my temper and my besetting sin!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I don t overcome them, how can I be holy, see the face of the Lord, and have the proper church life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Leap out of your besetting sin and give Satan a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to my experience, I can testify that if you try to overcome your temper, your temper will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not pray to overcome your temper pray to overcome the prince of Persia and the prince of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pray that there may be a way for Michael to come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Pray that many in the Lord s recovery may not only remain part of the woman but also become part of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we pray like this, then one day the man-child will come into existence, and the archangel Michael will take the lead to wage war in the heavens against the dragon and to cast him down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C. Being Resurrected and Raptured to Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>and not Tolerating to See Satan in the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the man-child has been resurrected and raptured to heaven, he will not tolerate to see Satan in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even today, we should not tolerate to see Satan in the church, but should fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you fight against Satan today, you will be qualified to fight against him in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we have been raptured to the throne of God, we shall see Satan, and he will be terrified of us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we see him, we shall not tolerate his presence there and we shall say, Satan, are you still in our God s sanctuary?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not your place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan, you must go.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately, Michael will act on our word and war against him.</S>
