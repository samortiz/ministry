   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE TESTS OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND OF THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:19; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 4:6</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider all the tests in the New Testament of the genuine oneness of the Body and of the proper one accord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Immediately after the oneness was accomplished in Acts chapter two, the tests began to come in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message I have selected fifty-one cases in the New Testament, from Acts to Revelation, in which the genuine oneness of the Body and the one accord in the churches was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By considering all these tests and the way in which they were taken care of, we can see several things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we can see the actual situation of the churches at the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For many years I held the concept that the churches in the apostolic age were wonderful, but today my concept has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After considering the fifty-one tests of the oneness and of the one accord, I now realize that the churches in the age of the apostles were not as wonderful as I had thought.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is hard to tell whether their condition was better than ours or not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, by considering this list of cases, we can learn how to face all the tests.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can learn how to solve the problems and how to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we would ponder all these items, we will surely see the way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that this is the reason that all these negative things were recorded in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe the Holy Spirit s intention was to establish some examples from which we may learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, by considering all these tests of the oneness and of the one accord, we can see what things should be tolerated and what things should not be tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many things may be mistakes and may cause us trouble, yet we should not be bothered by them; they are tolerable and can be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, by all these examples we can find a few things that the Spirit would not tolerate; they are intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning these things, there is the need to exercise to quarantine those who are responsible for the contagious situations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I came into the recovery in Chefoo in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church life at that time was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I remained in Chefoo for a little over a year, and during that time I did not see anything as a test of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the Lord led me to leave my job and to enter into His work full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In October 1933 I went to Shanghai, and Brother Nee asked me to enter into the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After approximately one year, in the fall of 1934, a big turmoil arose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That was the first time that I saw a test of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From that year until today I have passed through turmoil after turmoil, approximately one in every six to ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At times I have been bothered by this, thinking that our labor did not produce a satisfactory result.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fifty years ago I wondered why such things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time Brother Nee s ministry was the highest in the entire world, but the situation was not very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I came out of mainland China and went to Taiwan, the work in Taiwan had a wonderful beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In less than six years, from 1949 to 1954, our number increased from fewer than five hundred to about fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, not long after that, a turmoil arose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Again I considered why this kind of thing happens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From that time I began to see that there was not one church recorded in the Bible that did not have any trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This comforted me very much, and I was much less bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I. THE TEST OF THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>ACTS 6:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we can see that murmurings arose because of the unequal daily dispensing of food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even in the glorious condition of the church after the day of Pentecost, murmurings arose over the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This problem was solved by the proper service arranged by the apostles according to the practical need vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE TEST OF PETER S CONTACT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>WITH THE GENTILES ACTS 11:1-18</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the Levitical regulations Lev 11, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Acts 10:9-16, 28 , the Jews were not allowed to contact the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They considered the Gentiles unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, in Acts 10 Peter contacted the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because of this, a disputation arose between the disciples of the circumcision and Peter Acts 11:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This disputation was solved by Peter s testifying of the facts according to the truth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In dealing with such disputes, we must present the facts, and these facts must be vouchsafed by the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a big problem must be solved in this way: by the presenting of facts that are fully according to the New Testament teaching, the truth.</S>
