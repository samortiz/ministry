In this message we want to address more of the items raised up by these ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Concerning the One Accord</H2><P>Can we be in one accord if we have differences? The answer to this question is "yes." We must be in one accord in spite of the differences. Both in the Gospels and in Acts, we are taught to be in one accord (Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6). Some would say that we must get rid of all the differences among the believers in order to be in one accord, but this is only to make everything uniform.</P><P>In the New Testament churches, there were many differences. In Romans 14 Paul said that we must receive both those who regard a certain day and those who do not (vv. 1, 5-6a). Paul said that we must receive the believers who may differ from us in their doctrinal concepts or religious practices because God and Christ have received them (14:3; 15:7). Since both God and Christ have received them, how can we not receive them? Paul said that some ate only vegetables, while others ate all things (Rom. 14:2-3). We must receive both because God and Christ have received them. In receiving the believers, Paul was very broad and liberal. He was not narrow-minded.</P><P>More than twenty-five years ago, there was a sister among us who was Jewish. One day she told me that even when the dishes and forks used for eating pork were washed with detergent, she could still smell the pork on them. There are all kinds of people in the church. We all have been saved, yet we have many differences. Some practice foot-washing or head covering. Some baptize by immersing one time, while others baptize by immersing three times. If all of these different believers were among us, could we have the one accord? I would love to see church meetings of believers in one accord with all kinds of differences. That would be marvelous!</P><P>In 1963 in the church in Los Angeles, there were at least four different groups meeting together. In the previous year, I held the first conference in the Lord's recovery in the United States, and I spoke from Deuteronomy 8 concerning the all-inclusive Christ. These messages attracted many people. When others heard about these messages, they invited me to hold conferences in their places. Therefore, when the first conference ended on December 31, the next day I went to Whittier, California and spoke to a group that was composed mainly of Brethren believers. Eventually, they asked me to go to speak to another group in Las Vegas. The group there was an independent Bible church. I visited them on about four different occasions. Eventually, that whole congregation decided to move to Los Angeles in order to join the church there.</P><P>This group and at least three other groups came to Los Angeles. One day they all agreed to come together. In the place where we met jointly in Los Angeles in 1963, I put up two banners. The first banner read&#151;"Unity versus Uniformity," and the second banner read&#151;"Unity with Variety." At the beginning in Los Angeles, this was our situation. We had much variety, but we also had the unity.</P><P>Later I went away to New York. In my absence, the slogans on the banners did not work. During a meeting, one of the young sisters began to play the tambourine. One of the brothers from the Brethren group told the sister to stop playing it. I received a phone call about this incident while in New York. When I arrived back in Los Angeles, I spoke with the brother from the Brethren group. I asked him to compare the tambourine with the piano, and he said that he preferred the piano. I said, "Brother, in the eyes of God, what is the difference between these two musical instruments?" He agreed that there was no difference in the eyes of God. I continued by saying, "Since these two instruments are the same in the eyes of God, they should also be the same in our eyes." The brother responded by saying that he could not take the playing of the tambourine. I said, "Brother, since you cannot take the playing of the tambourine, you are unable to live the church life."</P><P>The church life must be of unity with variety. To be in one accord does not mean to get rid of all the differences. If this were the case, we could never have the one accord in this age. We must be exercised to such an extent that we keep the unity without caring to have uniformity. We should be happy to see a meeting full of differences, yet without any discord.</P><P>In the early days in Los Angeles, some tongue-speakers came into one of the meetings. When they began to speak in tongues in the meeting, some of the brothers looked at me to see what I would do. Eventually, the brothers motioned to me that I should stop them when these ones began to interpret their tongue-speaking. But I said quietly to the brothers that we should let them go ahead. We can take such differences.</P><P>A number of years ago, some brothers took the way of the Lord's recovery, but they would not practice the Lord's table. When this matter was referred to me, I said that there was no problem. Whether they liked to have the Lord's table or not, they had been received by the Lord, so we had to receive them. The church in their locality kept this practice of not having the Lord's table for a good number of years. In spite of this, the saints there were really one with the saints in the other localities. There was one accord in spite of the differences. Gradually, the brothers and sisters who did not practice the Lord's table heard about it and wanted to practice it. Today they have the Lord's table regularly. This is an example of keeping the unity with variety.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
