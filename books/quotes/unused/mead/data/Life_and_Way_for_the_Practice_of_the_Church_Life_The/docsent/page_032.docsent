   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR INWARD PARTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may feel that several brothers are good brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But do not assume that they are without problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because they are not transformed, they can be very troublesome brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are good, yet so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One of them may be naturally quick, and another one may be naturally meticulous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One is very fast, and the other is overly concerned with details.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the fact that they have Christ within them, no doubt, they are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But their natural man has no part in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, the problem is not with the Christ within but with their being so natural without.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When one who is naturally quick and one who is naturally meticulous come together to serve the Lord, they will have problems with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that the Christ within this one is fighting with the Christ within the other one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that the quick one is fighting with the meticulous one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both are members of Christ, but both are human.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are good, but they are humanly good, naturally good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we need the transformation in our inward parts through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the time we were saved, the Lord Jesus as the Spirit of life came into us as the one law regulating our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One law in many parts means one law with many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit as the one law permeates our mind, He becomes the law of the mind, regulating our thoughts and our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He permeates our emotion, He becomes the law of the emotion, regulating and ruling over what we like or dislike.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He permeates our will, He becomes the law of the will, regulating and governing our making of decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, there is one law becoming three kinds of laws.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But actually, they are not three laws but three functions of one law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Spirit as the law regulates us in our inward parts, we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How much we will be transformed depends on how much we are willing to be regulated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are willing to be regulated by Him in our mind, our mind will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That means our mind will be permeated and saturated by Him and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our mind will be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our thoughts and the way we think will be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we allow Him to regulate our emotion, He will permeate our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then our desires, our preferences, will be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means we are being transformed in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever we like or desire will have the image, the expression, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, if we allow Him to govern, rule over, our will, our will will be possessed by Him and be full of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then whatever we decide will have the flavor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the transformation of our inward parts by the wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the law of life within us, living, moving, working, shining, illuminating, regulating, ruling, and governing within us.</S>
