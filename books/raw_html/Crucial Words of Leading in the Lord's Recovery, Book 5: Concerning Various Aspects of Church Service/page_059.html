	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRAINING FOR THE MEMBERS<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we praise You for revealing Yourself in us and for living in us. What a life, what a peace, what a joy, and what a rest! Grant all Your children to be brought into a real experience of You, eating You every day, being mingled with You, living by You, enjoying You, and allowing You to enjoy us. Lord, we look to You again. As the Lord of our life in the church, we pray that You would lead us, supply us, and encourage us.</p>
<p>I believe that now all the brothers and sisters have seen that the small group is the way to build up the church, the way to gain people, the way to shepherd others, and the way for mutual care. Not only so, the small group is also the way to uphold the saints and to equip and perfect the saints in the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESTABLISHING THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>I hope that we all see the importance of the small groups: it is the way of the Lord today. If we do not go forward on this way, there is no other way that we can take, because this is truly the way of the Lord. However, this does not mean that blessings will be poured out instantly from heaven. We still need much more practice. We must have the sober feeling that only success is allowed, not failure. We must have faith. As long as we are willing to give ourselves to this endeavor, we will succeed. As long as we are willing to learn, we will succeed. During our fellowship, Brother Lee has reminded us on many occasions that the main reason for the lack of results in our service is that we are not willing to learn and to make progress. When we encounter a problem, we complain that this way does not work. Since we have an attitude that the way will not succeed, we want to give it up. Nothing that is of value is easy to do. If we are willing to face the difficulties we encounter, we will succeed, and if we are willing to labor, we will reap a harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE CHURCH EMPHASIZING<br />
THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>Establishing the small groups is not only a change of method but also a change of system. In the past, one person spoke and the rest listened, but now everyone is speaking, everyone is pursuing, and everyone is preaching the gospel. This is a change of system. The small groups provide a venue for the saints in the church who have a heart to serve. It gives them the opportunity to exercise their organic function. We want the Body of Christ to be expressed on the earth, but it is not easy to arrive at this point. In a big meeting it is not easy for the saints to function according to their portion. However, in a small group everyone has an opportunity to practice. Therefore, in the service of the small groups we must be active, and we must be concerned, burdened, and willing to exercise our portion.</p>
<p>From now on we need to pay attention to the following points. First, the atmosphere in the church must emphasize the small groups. Such an atmosphere comes from fellowship. This means that we need to consider this matter in our hearts all the time and that we need to speak about it. We all need to see the importance of the small groups and that the small groups are the way for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to change the system so that everyone can function to express the Lord&rsquo;s Body. If we speak of this in private as well as in public, eventually an atmosphere that supports our speaking will spontaneously be formed in the church. To this end, the members must give themselves to enable the whole church to see the importance of the small groups.</p>
<p>Second, we should participate in the small groups every week, unless it is absolutely unavoidable. Do not forsake the small group meetings because of trivial things. Third, we should be prepared to get into the Life-study messages. We can use the time during morning watch or another time to enjoy the message and to touch the revelation, the sweetness, and the light in the message. If we store these in us, we will be enriched when we go to supply others.</p>
<p>Fourth, in a small group meeting it is crucial that we do not speak for too long. Every member in a small group should not speak too long. Being long-winded kills the meeting, because others become tired and begin to look down. Whenever the saints begin to look down, we should stop speaking. We should practice taking turns to speak. Then every person can speak several times, but we must not speak too much at one time.</p>
<p>Finally, after every small group meeting, there should be some review and consideration in fellowship. Without such a review, there will be no progress. Those who are burdened for the progress of the small group should be willing to speak truthfully in love to one another. There should be an open atmosphere so that no one would take offense with another. If there is a review after a meeting, it will be beneficial, and if we review regularly, there will be regular progress.</p>
<p>If no new ones are added to a small group after several weeks, it is not progressing as it should. The crucial key to the progress of a small group is the continual addition of new ones. The regular addition of new ones to a meeting indicates that the small group is in a constantly new condition. A small group should never reach the stage where only a fixed number of saints meet regularly. If a new one is added every two weeks, there will be a sizable increase in the church each month. Now our progress is very slow. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we promote the small groups, recover the saints who have not been meeting, and preach the gospel to bring in new ones.</p>
