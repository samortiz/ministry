   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, He is pleased with such ones and will remain with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, Christ was cursed by God on the cross and then forsaken by God.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As sinners, we should have been judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without Christ s substitutionary death, we would have had to bear God s judgment for our sins; instead, we were judged in Christ s judgment on the cross on our behalf.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God judged Christ on our behalf because He is righteous and we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The righteousness of His law required Him to judge Christ for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without His judgment of Christ, we would have to die and perish eternally; that is, according to the righteous requirements of His law, we would have to die and perish eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The righteous requirement of God s law is that sinners deserve death; this is related to the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This requirement is according to God s righteous condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because of this requirement, this condemnation, Christ became a curse upon the cross for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since Christ was cursed for us on the cross according to the righteous requirement of God s law, we were redeemed out of the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The judgment upon Christ on the cross satisfied the righteous requirement of God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The law cannot place further requirements upon us, nor are we under the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now God can forgive and save us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s forgiveness and salvation must be righteously based upon the righteous judgment of His government.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If Christ had not borne God s righteous governmental judgment on our behalf and had not satisfied God s righteous requirement on our behalf, God would have had no way to forgive us or save us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since Christ did all this for us, God can forgive us and save us.</S>
