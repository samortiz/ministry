   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE TWO CAN MORALITY SAVE US Issue No. 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The translation of the Chinese title for this message is "Can Man Be Saved by Doing Good."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The title above was given by the author on the English cover of the original magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Can man be saved by doing good?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The world's answer is yes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But God's answer in the Bible is no. The authority to decide our salvation is in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Salvation is not according to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our salvation is related to God; we cannot make any decision on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot be saved just because we think we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nor can we be unsaved just because we think we are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Readers, listen to the voice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have to listen to what He has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not think that as long as you can do good, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to know that this matter is decided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can morality save men?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No. Absolutely no. Blessed is the man who knows this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today men think that exhorting others to believe in Jesus is the same as exhorting them to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Little do they realize that exhorting men to believe in the Lord Jesus is really proving to them that they cannot do good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even many believers do not realize that man is not saved by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their thought is to try their best to keep God's Word, attend services, offer money, help the church, and strive to be good, hoping that by so doing, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Little do they realize that these things are all vain!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These things do not help at all in the matter of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course I do not mean that we should not keep God's Word, offer money, etc. I am saying that we cannot be saved by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is most vain to argue and reason with man's words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us then turn to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever God says is fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" Rom 3:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meaning of "works of the law" here is to try to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The law was enacted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It shows men what they ought to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man could keep God's law, he would be the best person on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But God says here through the apostle that He has reckoned, that He is perfectly clear, that man is not justified by keeping the law and doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the meaning of justification?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It means that God not only forgives your sins, but reckons you righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, to be justified is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A justified person is a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God teaches that you cannot be saved or justified by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, my dear sinners, do not trust in your works, and do not think that you can be saved by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Stop your own work!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Confess that you are a hopeless sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior, and you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is worthy of man's praise because His salvation of man is not based on man's good works.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He says, "Where sin abounded, grace has superabounded" Rom 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Readers, do you know that you are sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Does not your conscience condemn you?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you not think that men such as you are helpless?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not be deceived in thinking that you can be saved by doing good, or that you can be saved by joining a church, singing in a choir, praying, or attending services.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not try to mend your transgressions by human ways.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are sinners, and no matter how much you mend yourselves, you are still sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is like a black man from Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No matter how much he tries to put on powder or paints himself with white paint, he is still a black man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not try to do good by yourselves anymore!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter how much you have sinned, the blood of the Lord is able to cleanse you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Come!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Spurgeon of England was an evangelist who was greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once he said that if the Lord would save him only if he did good, he would never want to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He gave an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suppose he had done many good things, and then presented this goodness before God and asked, "Since I have done so much good, can I be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since God is the God of all goodness, surely He would not approve of Spurgeon's goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He would shake his head and say, "You have not done enough!"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Spurgeon said he would then go away in discouragement and would try to do better.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After a few years, he would present his goodness before God again, asking God if his goodness was good enough, and if he could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God would answer again, "You are still not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You still cannot be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This could go on for two or three more times, and God would still not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How then could he be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If God expected him to do good before he could be saved, He would probably never be satisfied, and Spurgeon would not be saved even if he worked himself to death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is this not a pitiful thing?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Spurgeon concluded that if God expected him to do good before he could be saved, then he would not want to be a Christian in the first place because he would find out after striving for many years on earth that God would not be satisfied with him and whatever he would have done would have been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to thank the Father because we do not have to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All we need to do is to believe in God's Son, and we shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although it is true that God is not satisfied with our works, and although it is true that we do not have any merit of our own, He is pleased in His Son, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is satisfied with the righteousness that the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although we cannot and will not do good by ourselves, the minute we believe in His Son and accept the merit of His Son's shed blood on the cross, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Dear readers, do not be deceived by Satan into thinking that you will be saved by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You must realize that just as you cannot build a ladder that reaches heaven, you cannot secure God's salvation through doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not obtain God's justification through good works.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, we are "being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus" Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"If by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace" 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Are not these two verses very clear?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are justified and saved by God, not because of works, but because of His own grace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Grace and work are two principles that are completely opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Grace means that God is willing to save whether a man is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Man is not worthy to be saved, but because of mercy, God gives him salvation freely.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Work, on the other hand, is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Work means that only good people will be saved, while bad ones will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In other words, man has to do good to save himself, and all those who cannot save themselves will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We know that we are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although we may not have committed the sins of murder or arson, our nature is corrupted; our thoughts and conduct are full of deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are truly sinners!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>How can we be saved through works?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Thank and praise God that He does not save us because of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is saving us because of His free grace, a grace which we do not deserve.</S>
