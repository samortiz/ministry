Psalm 147:19-20 says, "He declares His word to Jacob,/His statutes and His ordinances to Israel./He has not dealt so with any other nation;/And as for His ordinances, they have not known them." This shows clearly that God only gave His statutes and ordinances to the Israelites. Concerning the Gentiles, Romans 2:14 in the New Testament says that the "Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves." Here we find the phrase Gentiles, who have no law. This proves that the Gentiles are not under the law of God. This is the clear teaching of the Bible. When a Gentile is saved, does he have to keep the law? Acts 15:29 says, "To abstain from things that have been sacrificed to idols and blood and things strangled and fornication, from which if you carefully keep yourselves, you will do well." After Paul preached the gospel, many Gentiles were saved. Some Jews from Judea said that the Gentile believers should be circumcised and should keep the law of Moses. Later the apostles and elders in Jerusalem made the decision not to ask these Gentile believers to keep the law. They only had to abstain from four things. Before the Gentiles were saved, they had "no law." After they were saved, the Bible does not ask them to keep the law. They were only asked to abstain from things that had been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. God has not given the law to the Gentiles. This is true both in the case of saved ones as well as unsaved ones.</p><h2 class="head3">The Law Being Given to the Jews</h2><p>When the Bible speaks of the law, it says that God gave the law to the Jews. The Jews are born under the law. To them, the heaven and the earth may pass away, but one iota or serif shall by no means pass away from the law. In Matthew 5:18 the Lord says that one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass. The Lord has no intention to annul the law among the Jews. His intention is to put the Jews under the law. He says that the law must be fulfilled. The fulfillment in this case is a kind of complement. Originally, the law said that one should not kill. Now not killing is not enough; one must not even hate. This is a kind of complement, and this is the way the law is to be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head3">The Law Having Nothing to Do<br />with Believing Jews</h2><p>Since the law is given to the Jews, what should the Jews who have believed in the Lord do? What is their relationship to the law? After a Jew is saved, he becomes a member of the church and is no longer a Jew. Romans 7:1-4 says that a Jew believing in the Lord is like a woman marrying a man. The woman in this case already had a husband&mdash;the law. In order for her to marry another man, her first husband must die. This is the only way. But Matthew says that not one iota or serif of the law can pass away. This husband&mdash;the law&mdash;will never die. What shall we do? This is the reason Romans 7:4 clearly shows us that the law controls a man only as long as he lives. Although the law, which is the husband, will not die, God caused Christ to die so that we, the woman, can die with Christ in Him. In this way we are freed from the law through death. We are freed from the first husband through dying with Christ. Then we are resurrected together with Christ and married to Christ the second husband. This death must be a real death. Only then will we not be an adulterer when we are given to Christ in resurrection. Within the Lord's death, God included our death. What an assurance this is! Our resurrection is included within the Lord's resurrection as well. How sure is this resurrection! To one who was under the law, it is a miracle to be able to receive a new life in resurrection through dying with the Lord. "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace" (6:14). This is so because the Lord has died. Since we have died to the binding law, we are now discharged from the law (7:6). By believing in the Lord and through participating in His death and resurrection, we are freed from the law. This is what happens to a Jew when he believes in the Lord. We must be clear about Romans 7 before we can deal with the question of the law. The law cannot be annulled. But we have died and have been liberated from the law. The Christian position is one that declares that we are dead. We stand on the position of death. We have been crucified with Christ. Today the law has nothing to do with us any longer. The law can only deal with the old man; it can do nothing to the new man that has passed through death and resurrection.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> </body></html>
