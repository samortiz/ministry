   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE AND THE FRUSTRATIONS TO LIFE IN THE PARABLES IN MATTHEW 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we can understand the parables in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not care for the great tree in Matthew 13:31 and 32; that is too negative.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, we should pay our attention to life, which is the central thought in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sowing the Seed of Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may use one word for each parable in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first parable the word is seed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A sower went forth to sow the seed into the earth, signifying humanity, the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sower is Christ, the Son of God, who came to sow the seed of life into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, the seed is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He Himself is the sower and the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ comes as the sower to sow Himself as the seed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not come to teach or to be a great rabbi.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus, he called Him Rabbi.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord right away responded, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" John 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "I am not coming to be a great rabbi to teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am coming to be a seed sown into you that you may be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I came to sow Myself into you as the seed of life."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first parable in Matthew 13 has four aspects because it speaks of four kinds of hearts as the growing soil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the first aspect, the enemy of God came as the birds of the air to snatch away the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's way is to sow His Christ into us, but Satan's way is to snatch the seed away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, regardless of how much the enemy can snatch away, something is still left.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in the second aspect there is the stony ground.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The stones make a person superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Someone may be glad about God's testimony, God's message concerning Christ as life, but he is actually shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Underneath, he is full of stones; he is the stony ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Farmers know that almost nothing can grow in this kind of soil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the third aspect, the cares of this life, the lusts, and many worldly things become the thorns that choke the growth of the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this aspect also, there is almost no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Due to the snatching away, the superficiality, and the choking, the seed is almost all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But praise the Lord, He is eventually victorious!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The enemy can only delay God's purpose, but His purpose can never be nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So eventually, there is the fourth aspect in which the seed is sown, it grows up, and it bears fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a brief, clear picture of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must answer before God: Has Christ been sown into us?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, praise the Lord, He has been.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, are we in the first, second, third, or fourth aspect?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ has been sown into us, but is there growth, or is the growth choked?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Seed Growing into Wheat</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the second parable of Matthew 13, the descriptive word is not tares; we do not want to pay attention to the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word is wheat v. 25 . The seed has become wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you think that the enemy, having done as much as he did to spoil seventy-five percent of the seed, will now go to sleep?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may sleep, but the enemy never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While people sleep, the one who does not sleep comes in to sow the tares, the false, imitation wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The intention of the enemy in sowing tares is to frustrate the growth of the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Satan adds many false Christians with the intention of frustrating the growth of the real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Look at today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a great mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may say that it is all right to have the false ones among us, but sooner or later we will be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may illustrate the effect of the mixture in this way: I may wear a dirty, blackened coat, while you stand next to me wearing a white coat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Can your white coat make mine white?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No, but eventually my dirty coat will blacken your white coat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I can blacken you, but you cannot whiten me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How many worldly things have been brought into today's church by the imitating, false Christians to frustrate the real growth of the genuine believers!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Can you trace the subtlety of the enemy?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First he snatches away, second he causes us to be stony, and third he chokes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, God has some wheat, but Satan comes in to plant the tares to frustrate the growth.</S>
