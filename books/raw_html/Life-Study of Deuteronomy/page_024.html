<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. MOSES SETTING APART<br>THREE CITIES OF REFUGE EAST OF JORDAN</H2><P>Finally, in 4:41-43 Moses set apart three cities of refuge east of Jordan. After the foregoing review of the past, Moses took thought concerning the manslayer who slew his neighbor without intent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Manslayer Losing<br>the Right to Live in the Good Land</H2><P>A manslayer could lose the right to live in the good land. Therefore, refuge cities were needed for those who slew others without intent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By the Cities of Refuge<br>the Manslayer Still Having a Way<br>to Live in the Land</H2><P>"Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, that the manslayer might flee there, who slays his neighbor without intent and did not hate him formerly, and in fleeing to one of these cities might live" (vv. 41-42). This indicates that by fleeing to one of the cities of refuge, the manslayer still had a way to live in the land.</P>
