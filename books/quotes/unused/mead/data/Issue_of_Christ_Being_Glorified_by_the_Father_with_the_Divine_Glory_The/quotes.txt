[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE CONCEALED GLORY OF CHRIST'S DIVINITY OUTLINE Christ as the second of the Triune God possessed the divine glory from eternity past.
[2]  His humanity through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity.
[3]  Although He did express the attributes of God in His human living as His virtues in His humanity, the glory of His divinity was mostly concealed by the shell of His humanity.
[4]  It was only in His transfiguration on the mountain while He was living in His humanity, that the glory of His divinity was manifested for a glimpse to His disciples Matt 17:2; John 1:14b; 2 Pet 1:17-18.
[5]  V. LONGING TO BE BAPTIZED WITH THE BAPTISM OF HIS DEATH FOR THE RELEASE OF THE GLORY OF HIS DIVINITY
[6]  While the glory of His divinity was concealed by the shell of His flesh or humanity, the Lord Jesus was pressed and constrained, longing to be baptized with the baptism of His death for the release of the glory of His divinity.
[7]  His incarnation caused His divine glory to be concealed in His flesh, but through His death His glory was released for the producing in His resurrection of the many grains, which become His increase as the expression of His glory.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE RELEASE OF THE GLORY OF CHRIST'S DIVINITY OUTLINE Through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death-John 12:24: He was the unique grain that contained His divine life with His divine glory.
[9]  I. THROUGH THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL OF HIS HUMANITY BY HIS DEATH
[10]  CHAPTER THREE THE ISSUE OF CHRIST'S GLORIFICATION THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS OUTLINE Through His glorification in His resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity, and became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, and regenerated all His believers to be God's children, God's species.
[11]  Through this all Christ's believers have been brought into the union of life with the processed Triune God and mingled with the consummated God into an incorporation: God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation John 14:10-11: By coinhering mutually "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."
[12]  I. CHRIST BECOMING THE FIRSTBORN SON AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AND REGENERATING ALL HIS BELIEVERS TO BE GOD'S CHILDREN, GOD'S SPECIES
[13]  The Son as the first Comforter left His believers through His death and came back to be another Comforter to them through His resurrection to make them live with Him vv.18-19 .
[14]  The Father's house is a divine and human incorporation of the processed and consummated God constituted with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect.
[15]  All the believers in Christ, redeemed through His blood, regenerated with His life by His Spirit, and transformed with the divine element by the life-giving Spirit, are the "abodes" in the Father's house.
[16]  This Father's house is built up by the constant visitation to the redeemed elect of the Father and the Son with the Spirit who indwells the redeemed elect to be the mutual dwelling place of the consummated Triune God and His redeemed elect John 14:23: Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone, growing into the holy temple of the Lord, the dwelling place of God in the believers' spirit Eph 2:19-22.
[17]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are training us.
[18]  Now we come to a crucial matter: To eat the hidden manna is to be incorporated into the tabernacle.
[19]  I. THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS BEING THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER
[20]  Its branches are the believers of Christ, who by nature were branches of the wild olive tree and have been grafted into the cultivated olive tree Rom 11:17, 24 through their believing into Christ John 3:15 .
[21]  For the unlimited Triune God's multiplication as the increase of the immeasurable Christ, the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God John 3:29-30 , for His universal spreading: Through the fruit-bearing of the believers of Christ as the branches by their faithful abiding in Christ John 15:4-5, 16.
[22]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we could come back to You to wait on You until You show us this universal view of Your universal incorporation.
[23]  Union is concerning our oneness in life with the Lord.
[24]  In order to see this revelation, it will be helpful for us to reconsider how the New Testament is composed.
[25]  John begins by saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" v. 1 . Then verse 14 says, "The Word became flesh." John the Baptist saw this One and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" v. 29 . He also saw the Spirit as a dove descending upon and abiding upon Christ v. 32 . Then at the end of chapter one of John, we can paraphrase what the Lord said to Nathanael in this way: "You recognize Me as the Son of God, but you will see the angels ascending and descending on Me, the Son of Man" v.51 . All of these verses show that John 1 is a mystery.
[26]  CHAPTER SIX THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FATHER'S HOUSE, THE TRUE VINE, AND THE NEW CHILD OUTLINE The function of the Father's house: For the processed and consummated Triune God to have a mutual abode with the redeemed and regenerated believers in Christ John 14:2-3, 23.
[27]  For Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, to make His home in the hearts of His believers who are strengthened in their inner man by the Father, according to the riches of His glory, with power through His Spirit unto the fullness expression of the processed Triune God Eph 3:16-19.
[28]  In this message we want to see the functions of the three aspects of the universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.
[29]  The function of the true vine as a sign of the Son John 15:1-8, 16 is for the Triune God to have an organism in the Son for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification in His divine life v. 8 .
