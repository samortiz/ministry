<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPER ONE ACCORD<br>IN THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6; Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil. 1:27; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rev. 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:11-13; Phil. 1:15, 17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONE ACCORD<br>BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS</H2><P>I have put the genuine oneness first and the proper one accord second. Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body's own organic oneness. In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, "One church and one Spirit..."; rather, he said, "One Body and one Spirit..." The church may be plural as the churches in different localities, but the Body could never be plural. Whether it is viewed locally or universally, the Body is one. In contrast, the church is universally one but locally many.</P><P>In the Body we need oneness; in the churches and among the churches, we need the one accord. The one accord is for our practice; the oneness is primarily for the actuality, for the fact. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for such a fact, and on the day of Pentecost, by pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit, He accomplished His prayer. That was the actuality of the oneness. After the accomplishment of the actuality of the oneness, there is the need for the practice of the oneness. When the oneness is practiced, it becomes the one accord. The one accord is the practice of the oneness.</P><P>If we have only the oneness as an actuality, and do not have the present, practical one accord, the oneness that we have will be objective and abstract; it will not be real to us. If we would apply the oneness accomplished by the outpouring of the Spirit, we must practice the one accord. If among us there is no one accord, how could we say that there is oneness? If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness? As long as we have differences existing among us, the oneness is not applied. We must have the one accord to swallow up all the differences; then oneness will be present.</P><P>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is the application of the oneness. Although oneness and one accord seem to be synonymous, there is a difference between them. The Lord did not teach us concerning oneness. In John 17 He prayed for oneness, but in Matthew 18 He led us to practice the one accord. In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in one accord. That was His leading, His training, and His directing us to pray in one accord. As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting. When certain ones pray, we may shake our head as an indication of our displeasure, and when others pray, we may nod our head as an expression of our agreement. Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do no practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord.</P>
