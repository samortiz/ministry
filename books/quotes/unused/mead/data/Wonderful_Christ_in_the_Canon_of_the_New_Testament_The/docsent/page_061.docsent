   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON THE PROPER GROUND Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; 1 Cor 1:2; 3:9b, 11, 12a; Gal 1:2, 20-22; 4:11-12, 16; 1 Pet 2:2, 5; Rev 1:11; 2:7; 21:2, 18-19a THE ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages we have seen God s purpose and plan, which is to work Himself into us that we might be built up into the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And this is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning of the Bible God was alone, but He had the desire to have a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nothing could be His counterpart unless it was out of Him and brought back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should never forget that Eve came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not create one man and one woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God only created one man, and out of this one man a part was taken from his broken side with which God built a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God did not create a woman, but built a woman from that part which was taken out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man was created, but woman was built.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In building anything there is the need for material.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Woman was built with a part of the man as the material.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eve came out of Adam and went back to Adam from whom she was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the two became one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church as the Bride of Christ comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ on the cross was broken, and out of His side came blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His blood redeems us, and the water, which signifies His life, is for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And the church must go back to Christ as His counterpart that they may become one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is eventually the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that Eve was not only a part of Adam; Eve was Adam s enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without Eve, Adam was incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At best, he was just a half of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A man must have a wife to make him complete.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But God did not create another half for Adam; He put him to sleep and took a part out of his side and built this part into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then God brought this part back to Adam and Adam said, This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh Gen 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our concept is that we are fallen and sinful and we need a Redeemer, a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the New Testament tells us clearly that Christ came not only to be our Redeemer, but also to be the Bridegroom John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He came for a bride, and His Bride was produced in just the same way as Adam s was.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, He was crucified, but in another sense, He was sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During His sleeping, a part of Him was taken out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Throughout all the centuries, God has used this part to build the corporate Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day this corporate Eve will be brought back to Him, and He will say, This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This came out of Me. This part becomes the enlargement of Christ, and this is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Body-Christ is Christ enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Adam was enlarged in Eve, and now Christ is being enlarged in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day the enlargement of Christ will be complete, and that will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE NEED OF BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever the Bible speaks of the church as the Bride of Christ, there is always the need of building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even in Genesis 2:22, the Bible uses the word builded concerning the rib out of which Eve was made.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The King James Version uses the word made, but in the Hebrew it is the word builded.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not that God made a woman, but that God builded a counterpart for Adam with the rib out of his side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then, when we go to the end of the Bible, we see a building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That building is the New Jerusalem, and it is also the Bride Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bride is the holy city, and since it is a city, there is the need of building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ, the new man, the Bride, and the dwelling place, or the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the Body, the need is life; for the new man, the need is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the Bride, the need is love; for the temple, God s habitation, the need is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In life, the church is the Body; in person, the church is the new man; in love, the church is the Bride; and in building, the church is God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church must be these four things.</S>
