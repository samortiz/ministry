   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Jacob's Altar</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At Bethel, Jacob built an altar vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob's experience of the altar was progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When he saw the vision at Bethel 28:18-19 , he did not erect an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he did an excellent job of interpreting his dream, he only set up a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the years at Padan-aram, Jacob did not build an altar on which to offer something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, he employed many gimmicks to supplant Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After leaving Padan-aram, Jacob firstly returned to the eastern part of Jordan to Succoth 33:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 33:17 and 18 the Bible does not say that Succoth is in "the land of Canaan," as it does with Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At Succoth, Jacob built a house for himself and booths for his cattle, but he did not erect an altar for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This reveals that he cared for himself and for his cattle, but that he did not care for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, Jacob left Succoth and journeyed to Shechem in the land of Canaan, where he pitched his tent and erected an altar 33:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob called that altar "El-elohe-Israel," which means the God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This altar was built to the God of Jacob's individual, personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In calling the altar El-elohe-Israel, he was actually calling it the God of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They seek spiritual experiences for themselves individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have learned how to experience Christ and how to trust in God individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is not El-Bethel to them; He is El-elohe-Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But few Christians care for God's being the God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, nearly all Christian seekers care for God's being their God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of them might say, "Was not God the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is wrong with saying that God is my God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, this wonderful God is my God!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps their book of Genesis does not have more than thirty chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They must proceed to chapter thirty-five and see that God is no longer merely the God of individuals, but the God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At Bethel in chapter twenty-eight, in Padan-aram, and in Succoth, Jacob had no altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Shechem he did build an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although it was good to build an altar in Shechem, this altar was not built at the house of God; it was not built in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, it was erected at a place somewhat removed from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you consult a map, you will see that Shechem was not too far from Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word Shechem means shoulder, signifying strength.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Jacob came to Shechem, he was strengthened, for Shechem was a place of strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, when we come to our "Shechem," we also are strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nearly all the revivals in today's Christianity take place in "Shechem."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These revivals merely strengthen people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians need a "Shechem," a revival, once a year to strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No revivalists care for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are only concerned with strengthening people to go on in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing related to the church is covered by them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The altar built at Shechem was called El-elohe-Israel, by the name of God as related to an individual, not El-Bethel, by the name of God as related to a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some may say, "Isn't it good to be strengthened at Shechem?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But look at what happened to Jacob in chapter thirty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After he had settled down in Shechem, trouble came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He had a tent for his dwelling and an altar on which to sacrifice something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Jacob might have been satisfied, God was not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the experience of chapter thirty-four was necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Trouble came, and this trouble caused Jacob to lose his peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following this, in 35:1, God could say, "Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God seemed to be telling Jacob, "I don't want you to stay in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not adequate merely to be strengthened in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A strengthened life can never satisfy Me. I desire the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I don't want strength I want the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I don't want you to remain in Shechem, but to go up to Bethel."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After Jacob arrived at Bethel, he made an altar and called it El-Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jacob's experience of the altar was a gradual progression.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There was no altar in Padan-aram or in Succoth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The altar in Shechem was erected to the God of his individual experience; it was not an altar for the experience of God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The individual experience of God is good, but it is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to go on from the individual experience to the corporate experience.</S>
