You will continuously have new ones added to you. Generation after generation, everyone will be nourished and perfected. In this way, we will truly be the refined and educated ones. I believe that in a few years such a situation will be seen among us.</P><P>According to the revelation in the New Testament, the practice of the new way sometimes requires the help of the apostles and teachers. They conduct conferences and trainings in the church. We can see this in Paul. He conducted a long-term training in Ephesus, admonishing and teaching people for two to three years (Acts 19:8-10; 20:31). After this, he went to Troas, where he stayed for seven days and held a special conference (Acts 20:6-12). For this reason, from 1986 until now we have had full-time trainings. In addition to this, it would be to the further advantage of a big church like the church in Taipei to have conferences once a month to release timely messages, "blow the trumpet," and motivate the whole church to go forward. All these cannot be accomplished by the small meetings and are also needed.</P><P>When I returned this time, I felt happier than the last time because, according to my observation, all the local churches here have made progress. Therefore, I wanted once again to review with you the way to preach the gospel, to feed the lambs, and to have the group meetings. What I have fellowshipped with you is sufficient for you to take back to practice. I would ask that after you go back to your locality, you would fully carry this out step by step. You should not try to practice it in a general way; that will not work. You must definitely take the lead to do it, and you must make sure that the brothers and sisters are doing it. In this way, you will have a bright future ahead of you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TWO LESSONS</H2><P>In addition, I hope that you all can learn two lessons. In whatever you do, you have to look to the Lord from deep within, saying, "Lord, I am merely a channel and a vessel. Without You, whatever I do is empty. Without Your blessing, whatever I do will come to nothing." We need to have this kind of spirit and should pray this way all the time. There is another important lesson which we must not forget: regardless of which church, hall, or district we are in, we are all one Body. Therefore, we must keep the oneness of the Spirit and must be in harmony one with another, loving one another, learning from one another, and helping one another. We should not think that we are doing well and despise others. Neither should we be jealous because others are doing better. All these things should not be within us. If possible, we should go to one another to observe and to learn. Do your best to learn whatever can be learned. Do your best to teach others in whatever way you can help them. Even the people in the world have such an exchange all the time. We should have this all the more.</P><P>You must also understand that regardless of how careful you are and how much you love one another, no two persons will conduct their work exactly alike. For this reason, you need to avoid opinions, criticisms, and confrontations. You need only to do your best to learn and to do your best to work. You do not need to wait three to five years. I believe by this time next year you will have much improvement. In one year you can make much progress. May the Lord be merciful to you.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Divine Dispensing and Guidelines for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
