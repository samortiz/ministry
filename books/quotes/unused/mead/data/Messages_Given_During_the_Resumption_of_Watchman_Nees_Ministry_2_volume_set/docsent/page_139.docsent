   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, God Intending</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Church to Be the Kingdom of Priests</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What the Israelites had lost is today regained by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God desires that the church today be the kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter said that we are a royal priesthood and a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation, the apostle John said that we are all priests Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the gold and silver are for the temple and the tabernacle; they are not for the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one should worship a calf, not even the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man has to learn to execute God's judgment and to deal with the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only by this dealing will the real service be produced, and only then will the "Levites" rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Church Today</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not Having Arrived at God's Goal Yet</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What the churches are practicing today in all the localities is a big failure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The co-workers do not have the adequate understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the bread-breaking meeting, we can say that everyone can open their mouth and can pray now.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the matter of service, we have not seen everyone serving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have every brother and sister becoming a priest yet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the meetings, the only thing that everyone can do is to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is true that in the holy place the priests sang, but that was not the only service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today not everyone is serving yet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only when the priests and the people become one entity is there the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our service today is only the service of three or five people; it is not the service of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than the "Levites," no one else is qualified to serve any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet God's desire is that the whole Body would serve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Way Today Being for the Whole Body to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only do you have nothing to boast of; you have to confess your sin instead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Personal godliness not only does nothing to build up the church; it actually tears down the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way of the work, the proper way, is to help every brother and sister to do the work himself or herself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a question of much service or little service.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a question of everyone serving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unless we are all serving together, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is our way today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It has to be the church that is working.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It has to be the church that is preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It has to be the church that is saving the souls.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how well you work, as long as you are replacing others, you are one of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With you there is only the ministry; there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if you are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if you do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever you do, you are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Whole Body Taking the Gospel as Our Center</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The gospel is our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything else is done on the side only.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to take the gospel as our center.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth; the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The real preaching of the gospel is done by the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The preaching of the gospel by three or five cannot be considered the real preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we need today is for the whole Body, that is, everyone, to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the brothers and sisters see that the church is a Body, they will not be individualistic any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The most blessed and happy thing is to give oneself to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only when our money is with God will we be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people may have too many material riches with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why they are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they would lose some of what they have, their joy will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The question is not whether one's occupation is high or low.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The question is: "What are we here for?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some work in their jobs, while others take care of their families at home.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But everyone has to give his all for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I heard what Brother Witness Lee has done in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I also heard what he has done in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these works are good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But I would add one thing: In the matter of consecration, everyone must have a part.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone has to hand himself over.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By that time, the minute a person is saved, he will hand himself over and will be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Why do we baptize people?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the meaning of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Baptism means that we come under the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he does not belong to the world any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, he belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Baptism separates a person from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is because the baptism of many people was not up to standard at the beginning and the job was not done properly, that we need the "handing over," the make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the future, when we preach the gospel, there will be no need to put up big advertisements or propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Men will hear and will see the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They will see that everyone is serving.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there are three thousand people, all three thousand will be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everyone will be working, and everyone will be serving, but no one will be murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Realizing the Glory and Grace of Serving God</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brothers, how should we answer God's call?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the old days, men tried to usurp the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today, the priesthood is in our hands already.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Are we going to cast it aside?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What the Israelites had lost was lost; they could not recover it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Are we going to make the service of God something cheap in our hands?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For some, service to God is a matter of granting God a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But we have to see that for God to allow us to serve Him is His grace and favor on us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When a man does not see the glory of serving the Lord, he calculates everything.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But when he sees the glory of serving Him, he would kneel before God to beg for this service.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Recently the newspaper said that China Textile Corporation is issuing new shares.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the stock market is up, everyone wants to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As long as they have money, they would put it into the market.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Do we see the glory of serving God today?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Those who see it will surely give their all for it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Those who are standing far off do not know God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All those who know God's grace and who know themselves do not count the cost...</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Note: At this juncture, before the above words were finished, some brothers broke down in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Sister Pearl Wang also broke down in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Brother Witness Lee's concluding prayer: It is not that we can give the Lord much.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is what the Lord wants of us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>May the Lord grant us a more absolute, thorough, and serious service.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Amen.</S>
