<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Overcomers within the Churches</H2><P>Now we need to see the overcomers within the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). If we want to be overcomers within the churches, we need to overcome four "isms": Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism (Rev. 2:9, 20; 3:1-2, 15-17). These "isms" are part of a big religious system organized by Satan, out of which the Lord's children need to come (Rev. 18:4).</P><P>During the Lord's time on earth and during the time of the early apostles, Judaism was strongly opposing God's testimony. Those in Judaism opposed the Lord Jesus (Matt. 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22). They also opposed the apostle Paul (Acts 13:45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6). In Revelation 2:9b the Lord refers to "the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan." This verse reveals that Judaism is satanic in opposing the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>We also need to overcome Catholicism. The church in Thyatira signifies this apostate church. Catholicism is portrayed as the woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess, teaching and leading the people of God, even with "the deep things of Satan" (Rev. 2:20, 24). Within the Catholic Church are demonic things. This is not according to our word but according to the Lord's word in Revelation. The Lord has made clear to us that there is a system organized by Satan against His testimony.</P><P>Protestantism is seen mainly with the church in Sardis. Those in Sardis have a name that they are living when they are actually dead (Rev. 3:1-2). This shows that Protestantism is devoid of Christ as the living One and is hence Christless. Brethrenism is seen mainly with the church in Laodicea where the Lord is standing outside the door of the degraded church and knocking at her door (v. 20). This situation is characterized by lukewarmness (v. 16). In order to be the testimony of Jesus today, we need to overcome these "isms." We need to overcome the system of Satan which opposes the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>This system causes us to be affected in our love for the Lord. The very first thing that happens to the church in its degradation is the loss of Christ as the first love (Rev. 2:4). All the degradation comes in through the loss of the first love. In Ephesians 6:24 Paul said, "Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility." When we love the Lord in all the incorruptible things, we are saved from corruption. But as soon as we get led away from that love, corruption starts to come in.</P>
