 <h2 class="head3">Making the Body an Object<br />
of Seven Attributes of Oneness</h2>
<p>The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope make the Body one in every aspect as its attributes. The four factors of which the Body is composed, the two means by which the Body is separated from Adam and joined to Christ, and the one hope that is the glorious goal of the Body are the Body&rsquo;s attributes, which make the Body one in every aspect. The Body is altogether a matter of oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Accomplish the Aspiration<br />
and Prayer of the Lord</h2>
<p>This oneness of the above three attributes accomplishes the aspiration and prayer of the Lord. However, it is not yet the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness Possessed<br />
by All the Believers in Christ,<br />
Who Have Received the Spirit as the Seal<br />
of God&rsquo;s Possession (the Church) and the Pledge<br />
 of Our Inheritance (the Triune God)</h2>
<p>This oneness is possessed by all the believers in Christ, who have received the Spirit as the seal of God&rsquo;s possession, which is the church, and the pledge of our inheritance, which is the Triune God (Eph. 1:13-14). Because we have received such a Spirit as the consummated God, we have the oneness. We all possess this oneness; this oneness is our possession. However, we need to experience it. To possess the oneness is to have the actuality of the oneness. When we experience this oneness, the actuality becomes our practicality; the actual oneness becomes our practical oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Be Kept Diligently<br />
by All the Believers</h2>
<p>First, we possess this oneness, and then we should keep it. This oneness must be kept diligently by all the believers in Christ with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love in the uniting bond of peace, that we may walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (Eph. 4:1-3). We keep the oneness by practicing the oneness, first diligently, then with all lowliness, all meekness, and all longsuffering. Then we need to bear one another in the divine love and in the uniting bond of the divine peace. In this way we practice the possessed oneness and thus keep it to have a walk that is worthy of the calling with which God has called us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS PARTLY OF THE FAITH<br />
AND PARTLY OF THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>When we keep this oneness, it will become the third kind of oneness, that is, the oneness partly of the faith and partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:11-16). The faith mentioned in Ephesians 4:13 is the objective faith, denoting all the things in which we believe for our salvation. The faith equals the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is the teaching of the entire New Testament. The faith in which we believe is the contents of the entire New Testament. The three main things in the New Testament are God Himself, the person of Christ, and the work of Christ. We believe in what God is, we believe in what Christ is, and we believe in what Christ has done. This is our faith.</p>
<p>If we do not believe in any one of these main aspects of the New Testament teaching, we are divisive. Some so-called Christians say that they believe that Christ is the Savior, but they do not believe that Christ is God. They believe that Christ loved them and died for them, but they do not believe that He is God. We might mistakenly think that because they believe in Christ, these people are Christians. The Mormons and the modernists are such persons who do not believe that Christ is God. Because of this, they are divided from us.</p>
<p>This oneness is also the oneness partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We may know Christ, but we may not know Christ in full. The Christ whom we know may be very narrow. We need to have the full knowledge of Christ, that is, to know Christ in full. Then the Christ whom we know will be the enlarged Christ, the expanded Christ.</p>
