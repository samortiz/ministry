   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-TWO THE CHURCH THE OVERFLOW OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 3:19b; 4:13; John 1:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 1 we are told that the church is the Body and that this Body is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is the fullness of the Person who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FULLNESS OF THE VAST CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words all in all in 1:23 refer to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ fills the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is proved by 4:10 which says, He Who descended is the same Who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For Christ to fill all things is for Him to fill the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is so universally vast that He fills all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This vast Christ needs a Body to be His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fullness of Christ is the overflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is so unsearchably rich that He has an overflow, a fullness, a surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As His Body, the church is Christ s fullness, His surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s recovery is not concerned mainly with the recovery of outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In God s economy outward things have relatively little value.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s economy is Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church comes into existence as we inwardly experience the riches of Christ and thus become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND A SOCIAL ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is a big difference between the church and a social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church may seem to be a social group composed of different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Worldly people view the church in such a way, as just another social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to see the difference between the church and a social club.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Social clubs may have high requirements for their members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may insist on superior standards of dress, behavior, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Outwardly, the members of such clubs may be better than the saints in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, no matter how good a club may be, it is merely a human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In contrast to the church, it has nothing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the church is the overflow, the surplus, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The members of a club may be regulated outwardly according to certain requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who fulfill these requirements may have a very good appearance in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In certain respects, they may seem better than those in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, in the eyes of God the best of human standards and behavior is nothing but dung.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church we do not need outward improvement or correction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, we need Christ to swallow up all our shortcomings with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the members of the church are short in certain respects, this indicates that they need more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must resist the temptation to change the church into a social club with standards and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This has nothing to do with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Body of Christ is constituted solely of Christ wrought into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE FOCAL POINT OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am fully aware that in Ephesians, a book concerned with the church, Paul speaks about such things as wives submitting to their husbands, husbands loving their wives, children obeying their parents, and slaves obeying their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These things, however, are not the focal point of God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God s economy is not to have a good family life; it is to have a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are in the Body of Christ in a proper and practical way, we shall no doubt have a proper family life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, we may have an outstanding family life and yet have nothing to do with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have known unbelievers whose family life was better than that of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the family life of these unbelievers was good, it had nothing to do with Christ or with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is crucial for us to see that the focal point of God s economy is not a standard of character or behavior; it is Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In his subtlety, Satan, the enemy of God, has used such things as Bible knowledge, spiritual gifts, and evangelism to keep believers from seeing God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the time of the Lord Jesus on the earth and of the Apostle Paul, Satan utilized the Old Testament to veil the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord Jesus appeared to them as the very incarnation of God, they were not able to recognize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, with the Scriptures in their hands, they sentenced the Lord Jesus to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to their concept, they were serving God in so doing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christians today should not regard themselves as superior to those Jewish religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is entirely possible for Christians today to be deceived just as the Jews were.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The enemy still uses the knowledge of the Bible to keep people from seeing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, he will use almost anything as a substitute for Christ and to keep people from seeing the revelation of God s economy concerning Christ and the church.</S>
