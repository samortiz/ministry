If we pay attention to the events at the time Zechariah prophesied these words, we will see the significance of quoting his words here. At the time the prophet prophesied this word, God had already stretched forth His hands and had delivered the Israelites out of the land of captivity in Babylon. This is God's intervention in grace in the affairs of the Israelites. How similar was the condition of Sardis to that of the Israelites then! Sardis was also under God's intervention in grace. In the church in Sardis, we do not see the many sins committed in Thyatira. This proves that Sardis had God's intervention and went through a deliverance. If we read the books of the prophets after the exile, such as Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, we can see what the remnant of Israel received and heard. We see that although Jehovah turned their attention to His temple, they should have been zealous for His temple only by abiding in the coming Christ, in the Holy Spirit which dwelt among them, and in the coming glory. God did not want them to pay attention to His outward works such as the deliverance of Cyrus, Darius, and Zerubbabel. Even the temple that they were building should have occupied only a secondary place. They should have paid attention to God's future building of His heart's desire through Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit. He laid a stone with seven eyes before Joshua, and turned this high priest's attention to the Christ who is the foundation, who is the root and source of all things, and who is full of God's wisdom and power. The seven eyes refer particularly to Christ's being full of wisdom and prudence to win God's full pleasure with respect to the temple and worship. God told Zerubbabel: "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit" (Zech. 4:6). At that time, God wanted the Israelites to pay attention to the stone with the seven eyes. Now, God wants His church to pay attention to the Christ with the seven Spirits.</P><P>God knew what the Israelites had passed through. He knew the danger they faced and the difficulties. They had returned to their homeland, and they had not committed the sins that their forefathers committed in the holy land. They had rejected the sin of idolatry and the traditions of the Canaanites which their forefathers had practiced and had washed their hands of them to declare their innocence. What they were doing then was the building up of the Lord's temple. Outwardly speaking, there was truly an atmosphere of revival. Of course, we cannot doubt that it was indeed a revival, but God detected the danger there. He wanted to remind His people of the power of the Holy Spirit. If the Israelites had not forgotten God's teaching in Zechariah, they would not have fallen and become Pharisaical. Because they forgot what they had received and heard, they only outwardly maintained what they had recovered at their return and had already lost its inward vitality. For this reason, they were not at all prepared to welcome the first coming of Christ. When the magi from the east came, not only was Herod troubled, but "all Jerusalem with him." With their mouth they all confessed that they were waiting for Christ, but in their heart they had no desire for Christ. When He came, he was like a thief to them. They did not receive the benefit of His coming. On the contrary, the temple became desolate, and they received the greatest punishment.</P><P>This is the condition of Sardis. Although the Lord has released His children from "Babylon the Great" and has turned them back to the Bible to apprehend the gospel of grace at the time of the Reformation, and although they have left the corruption and idolatry of the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant church has not paid attention to the seven Spirits mentioned by the Lord here. As a result, they gradually became weak and lost many fundamental doctrines of God. In the end, although Protestantism does not hold in teaching and in work the many sins and heresies of the Roman Catholic Church, it has but an empty name; it has already lost its vitality in life. The inevitable result of this will be that when the Lord comes back again, they will not be able to face Him.</P><P>Here, the Lord showed the church in Sardis that He is the One with the seven Spirits. This means that He Himself has the full power to bear much spiritual fruit. In the millennium the Holy Spirit of God will accomplish God's will on earth. In the same way, Christ is doing the same work for the church now. All the power for accomplishing works of wonder in the coming world are His now. He is now using this power to work for His saints. This power is, of course, hidden, and only the eyes of faith can detect it. Although the church can fail, Christ Himself will never fail. No matter what kind of circumstance the church is under, He still has with Him the power of the Holy Spirit. The Lord mentions this to comfort His believers. Everything around may be corrupt, desolate, and cold, but He remains the source of all power. He is the timely help to His people at all times.</P><P>If we consider Pentecost, we will find out the way the Holy Spirit works. No one can utilize or frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit. This is why the apostles had such powerful testimonies, and this is why the believers could fellowship together in one accord. Without the knowledge that Christ today still possesses the same seven Spirits of God and the fact that the source of power for faith is the same now as it was then, we would surely be disappointed when comparing the present condition with that of the apostles' time.</P><P>Here the Lord reveals Himself as the One with the seven Spirits of God. As such He has boundless power and unlimited wisdom to accomplish God's desire. If the Reformers of the day had remembered this, they would not have looked up to the patronage and support of the power of the world. By doing so, they could not have helped but allow the power of the world to occupy a place in the church. It is as equally wrong for the church to rule over the world as it is for the world to rule over the church.</P><P>The Lord is also revealing Himself as the One with the "seven stars." The seven stars refer to all the authority and all the power of the church before the Lord. They refer to the works done by the churches as the seven lampstands in the name of the Lord. Unlike Ephesus, where the Lord held the seven stars in His right hand, here the Lord is referred to as only "having" the seven stars. He is not uplifting them with His power. However, they are still His. He wants them to acknowledge His authority and trust in His power of provision for the accomplishment of His work. They belong to Him, but they are not in His right hand. If the church would remember that the Lord is the One with the seven stars, it will know that He alone has the authority to rule and direct all the responsible and shining ones in the churches. If the church recognizes this, it will not recognize the power of the worldly kings and rulers over the ministry of the church, and it will not allow its various congregations to elect and to hire their preferred teachers and pastors.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
