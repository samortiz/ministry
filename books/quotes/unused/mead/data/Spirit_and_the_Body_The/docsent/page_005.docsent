   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CARE FOR THE LORD'S LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the Lord has burdened us to go to the campuses, we should not turn this into a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Any decisions that you make by yourself for others are an insult to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have done this, you must repent and, if necessary, ask the others to forgive you because you gave them instructions about what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None of us should ever tell others where they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What an insult this is to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who authorized you to make suggestions to others?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to help the others to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Young brothers and sisters, you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, we are burdened and led of the Lord to work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the young people must bring this matter to the Lord, pray, and offer themselves to the Lord once again, saying, "Lord, I want to go on with You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, where do You want me to go?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone must pray until he is clear about the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not expect others to instruct you where you should go.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is organization, religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every one of us, from the leaders to the least among us, must be brought into the presence of the Lord to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, the Lord is moving to the campuses, but perhaps in His sovereignty He will not allow you to go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may lead hundreds of others to go, but He may tell you to stay where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will be a proof that what is taking place among us is not a movement, but absolutely a matter of the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must go into the presence of the Lord and pray for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For years, I have been learning this lesson and practicing it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not in any kind of movement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything must be brought into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I cannot go to the Lord for you; you must go to the Lord yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all must learn this lesson that no one can go to the Lord for someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is the clergy-laity hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I can go to the Lord, then you can go to the Lord also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the newest one among us, the one most recently saved, must still go to the Lord himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually we all shall be able to say, "I am going to this place because I have inquired of the Lord, and He has led me to go there."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you must never go somewhere because a certain brother has encouraged you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never tell anyone where he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, you must have the assurance that the Lord is leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, we shall be in a movement, and there will be no spiritual value in what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not expect to be clear after one day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may not even be clear after ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A number of times I was not clear concerning the Lord's leading even after a hundred days.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every day I prayed and said, "Lord, have mercy on me."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finally, one day the clearance came, and I knew the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever I have acted upon such a leading of the Lord, I have never regretted it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's New Testament economy is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Acts 16:6 says that Paul and those with him "were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they were trying to go into Bithynia, the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them Acts 16:7, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>. However, Paul and his companions did not hold a conference to discuss the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, as Paul was waiting on the Lord, he saw a vision by night.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Acts 16:9 says, "And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul and his companions concluded that the Lord was calling them to preach the gospel to the Macedonians Acts 16:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even after seeing the vision, Paul might have wondered whether or not the Lord was leading them to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By this we see that the apostles walked and worked not according to their own decisions, but only according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the tragedy of today's Christianity is that so many do not have the Lord's presence and do not care for the leading of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For all practical purposes, they exalt themselves to be the Lord.</S>
