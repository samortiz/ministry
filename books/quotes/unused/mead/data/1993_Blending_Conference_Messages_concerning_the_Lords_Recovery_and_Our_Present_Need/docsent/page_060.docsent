   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everything we do in our Christian life should be motivated by our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a serious thing to lose that love, because the Lord warned the church in Ephesus, the church which had left the first love, that if they did not repent, He would remove the lampstand Rev 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To remove the lampstand means that they have stopped being the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not want to lose our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The next thing we need to overcome is worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church in Pergamos shows us the church which is married to the world vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord said that they dwelt where Satan's throne was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan's throne is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the marriage with the world, Satan's throne came into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To get involved with anything of the world is to be under Satan's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This degraded church had the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These teachings are a direct attack against Christ as the Head and against the functioning of the members of Christ's Body, so we want to overcome these teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to be the overcomers in the churches to overcome worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Antipas was a faithful witness of the Lord among those in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His name means against all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He stood against all the worldliness and died as a testimony to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The next thing we need to overcome is deadness Rev 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sardis had a name that they were living, but they were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament, death is more defiling before God than sin Lev 11:24-25; Num 6:6-7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For us to sit in a meeting and be dead is a major offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death is a very serious thing in the eyes of God, so we should not tolerate any deadness in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also need to overcome lukewarmness Rev 3:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should pray, "O Lord, make us burning."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The degraded recovered church thought that they were rich and had need of nothing, because they had so many rich teachings and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But they did not know that they were wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord counseled these ones to buy from Him gold, white garments, and eyesalve v. 18 . This shows that we need to pay the price to overcome lukewarmness so that we can be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, these burning overcomers maintain the testimony of Jesus.</S>
