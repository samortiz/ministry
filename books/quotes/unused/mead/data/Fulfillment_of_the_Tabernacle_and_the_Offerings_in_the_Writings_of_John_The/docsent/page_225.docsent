   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In John 21 the Lord Jesus was training Peter and other disciples to trust in Him for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I doubt that Peter prayed to the Lord concerning their living after those two meetings with the resurrected Christ on two successive Lord's Days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The disciples did not have the proper spiritual realization, the right spiritual habit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They did not practice living in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is nothing to indicate that Peter prayed to the Lord when he was in need of food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of praying, Peter said, "I am going fishing."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This utterance indicates Peter's disappointment with his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because he could no longer tolerate not knowing what to do, he decided to go fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 21 the Lord Jesus was training the disciples by keeping all the fish away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, "Do you think that you are able to catch fish?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am the One who created the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I had not created these fish, how could you get any?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am still the Creator, and the entire universe is under My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you don't go My way and carry out My commission to be sent out, you will not be able to catch anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All I have to do is say the word, and the fish will stay away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I want you to know that I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Listen to Me, and don't go fishing by yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I say go fishing, then you should go fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I say let down the net, you should let the net down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't do anything by yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to verse 6, the Lord told the disciples to cast the net on the right side of the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they did this, they caught an abundance of fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the disciples got onto the land with the fishes, they saw a fire of coals with fish lying on it and bread v. 9 . According to the Lord's word, they had caught an abundance of fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But then they learned that the Lord had already prepared fish and bread for them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By this the Lord trained them to realize that He is able to provide fish for them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though they caught many fish according to the Lord's word, the Lord did not use these fish to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No doubt, this was a real lesson to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no indication that the disciples asked the Lord Jesus how He obtained the fish and the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I certainly do not know where these fish came from.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here the fish and the bread signify the riches of the Lord's supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord provided the disciples with the riches of the sea and of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>RESTORED BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The disciples, especially Peter, learned a great deal from the Lord in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no further record to indicate that Peter was ever again troubled concerning the matter of having food to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, there is no hint that Peter went fishing again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of remaining in Galilee, he went to Jerusalem according to the Lord's word, a place that was not safe for the followers of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, he and the others had the boldness to remain in Jerusalem for ten days praying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not know how they obtained the necessary supply of food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it is clear from Acts 1 that Peter was not concerned about this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, Peter was taking care of the Lord's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, he spoke of the need of a replacement for Judas Acts 1:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But he had learned the lesson not to say, "I am going fishing."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this matter, he was trained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this we see that chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can testify from my experience with the Lord that He is able to provide for our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the day I was saved, I was walking home, and I stopped and said, "Lord, I am willing to give up the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I simply want to take my Bible and go throughout the villages preaching Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I don't care what I eat, and I am willing to suffer poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I only care to preach Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That was my only intention, and I made that decision before the Lord in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some years later the Lord raised up a church in my home town.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the number increased and the need became greater, the Lord burdened me to give up my job and to serve Him full time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He reminded me of what I had said to Him that day on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then He told me that it was time for me to leave my job and serve Him by taking care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I knew that He did not want me to serve as a hired one, but He wanted me to serve Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After more than fifty years of experience, I can testify that the Lord is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, Peter was trained by the Lord in John 21 in a strict, thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, the Lord used the situation in His wisdom to restore Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was by a miracle related to fishing that the Lord had called Peter three and a half years earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then after Peter's backsliding from the Lord's calling to his old profession, the Lord manifested Himself again to restore Peter through another miracle related to fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I believe that the Lord used this as a sign purposely to remind Peter of how He had called him three and a half years before.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in this aspect of the aggregate sign in chapter twenty-one we see that Peter was not only trained but also restored.</S>
