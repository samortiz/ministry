   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Coming from Eternity into Time</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In God's incarnation, He came from eternity into time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the first intrinsic significance we have to pick up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In eternity God was unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With Him everything was eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the day of incarnation came, He came out of eternity and entered into time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eternity has no limit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Time is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In eternity He could be everywhere, but in time He could not be in Nazareth when He was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a finite man, He was greatly limited.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 7 His brothers challenged Him by telling Him to manifest Himself to the world vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3-4 , but He told them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready" v. 6 . Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here on earth as a man, being limited even in the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the unlimited God, He entered into the limiting factor of time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God created everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said, "Let there be light," and there was light Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But He was not incarnated in this instant way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, He came out of His eternity to enter into time and stay in a virgin's womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all know how difficult it is to make a believer of Christ spiritual, sanctified, victorious, and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is omnipotent, and His power is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why would He not produce millions of spiritual persons in an instant?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His New Testament economy God does not do things instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He does everything in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's incarnation brought Him out of His eternity into the limit of time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. Coming with His Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>to Enter into Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God came out of eternity into time and with His divinity to enter into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Old Testament, the divine nature and essence never came into any human being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But one day the unique Divine Being, God, brought His divinity into the womb of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From that day God put humanity upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He never had anything human before that time, but in His incarnation He entered into humanity and put on humanity as a part of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was only divine in eternity, but through incarnation He became both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. To Mingle Divinity with Humanity into</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One Entity, Keeping the Two Elements Distinguishable in the One Entity and</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>without Producing a Third Element</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's move in His incarnation was to mingle divinity with humanity into one entity, keeping the two elements distinguishable in the one entity without producing a third element.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A heretical teaching in the past said that when divinity and humanity were mingled together, this produced a third element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines the word mingle in this way: "to bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, in God's incarnation, the elements of divinity and humanity were mingled into one entity, and the two elements remained distinguishable in the one entity without producing a third element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The truth concerning divinity being mingled with humanity was present in the early days of the church with the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But because of the heretical and wrong teaching concerning mingling, few Christian teachers have dared to touch it again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to see the pure truth in the Bible concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity as a great significance of God's move in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a divine thing is very spiritual and mysterious because it is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But in the Old Testament there is the marvelous type of the meal offering to show us the mingling of divinity with humanity in the person of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Leviticus 2:4-5 says that the meal offering was of "fine flour mingled with oil."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The oil is a sign of the Holy Spirit, and the fine flour is a sign of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit mingles Himself with man to produce a meal offering which is good for food both to God and to His priests.</S>
