   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVENTY-SEVEN THE ENACTMENT OF THE COVENANT 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 24:1-8; Heb 9:18-20, 22; Jer 31:33-34; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>36:25-29a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This message is a continuation of the foregoing message on the enactment of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that when Moses enacted the covenant, he built both an altar and twelve pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The altar indicates that we need to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The pillars signify that we need to become a living testimony of God, a reflection of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>WITH BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Exodus 24:5 says, And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto Jehovah lit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>. It is not difficult to understand the significance of these offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The burnt offering was for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were created by God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, because of the fall man has failed to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually Christ came as the second man and fully satisfied God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, He could be the burnt offering to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God was satisfied through the burnt offering, there could be peace between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This peace depends on the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When man and God together enjoy Christ, there is mutual satisfaction and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ first became the burnt offering offered to God to satisfy Him, and then He became the peace offering to make peace between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, Christ became a feast for God and man to enjoy mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Christ who has redeemed us and terminated us and who is now replacing us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we are replaced by Christ in our experience, the more we become the burnt offering and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day by day we satisfy God and enjoy peace with Him as we feast on Christ with God and enjoy Him with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By our own efforts to keep the law it is impossible for us to satisfy God, to have peace with God, or to enjoy Christ with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I say again that God did not give the law to His people with the intention that they observe it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s intention is for the people to be replaced by Christ and to become a reflection of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thank Him that in the recovery this has been made clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the natural concept, the almighty God, the Creator, the holy One, has given us the law that we may observe and keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although this religious concept is common among Christians today, it is far off from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We in the recovery may still be under the influence of this concept, perhaps subconsciously, to some degree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After listening to a particular message, we may pray, Lord, I make up my mind to live according to this message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please help me carry out my decision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of prayer exposes the fact that we are still under the influence of the natural, religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It takes a long time to be fully free from this influence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we read a certain requirement in the Bible, it is easy for us to make up our mind to fulfill that requirement ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Like the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, we promise the Lord that we shall do whatever He says.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we are enlightened by the Lord, we would no longer make up our mind to do what He requires.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, we would pray, Lord, have mercy on me, for I am not able to do what You require.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I praise You that You have redeemed me and terminated me and that You are in the process of replacing me with Yourself and making me Your reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord that we have the cross to terminate us and Christ to replace us!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is our burnt offering and our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we experience Him, He makes us a living burnt offering and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not come from trying to keep the law; it issues from experiencing the altar and the sacrifice, the cross for termination and replacement to become God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we experience Christ and the cross in this way, we shall have not only the altar and the sacrifices, but also the twelve pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah for Christ s marvelous redemption and replacement that can transform fallen, corrupted sinners into pillars!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not strive to keep God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ has redeemed you, and now He is in the process of replacing you, reconstituting you, and rearranging you to make you a living testimony of God, His reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you walk according to spirit and set your mind on the spirit, automatically the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled in you and you will become a testimony of God.</S>
