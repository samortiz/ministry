        <h2 class="head1">DIVINITY AND HUMANITY BEING MINGLED</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God was merely on the throne; He did not possess humanity. Today God is in us, and He is God yet man. Through the steps of incarnation, death, and resurrection the Lord accomplished redemption. Through incarnation God was mingled with man, and through death and resurrection man was mingled with God. Today the Lord Jesus is in heaven as a &ldquo;prototype,&rdquo; and God has a universal, great factory in which He is mass-producing this prototype. God&rsquo;s work today is to conform us to the image of the Lord; that is, God is working for the mingling of divinity and humanity.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden Adam&rsquo;s soul was his person. His spirit was merely an organ, a vessel; his spirit was not his person. The Lord Jesus is God and man, and He has both divinity, the divine element, and humanity, the human element. We have received Him into our spirit. Therefore, in our spirit we have both the divine nature with the divine personality and the human nature with the human personality. This human personality, however, is not natural but has gone through death and resurrection. Nevertheless, in our soul we still have our natural personality. Hence, as believers, we have two persons in us. In our spirit is the new man, who is of resurrection; in our soul is the old man, who is natural. Every believer has such a dual personality. The Lord is working to bring the natural personality in our soul into death and resurrection. Then the person in our soul will express the person in our spirit. In this way our soul will be one with our spirit, and God and man will be completely mingled together. Thus, God is mingled with man, and man is mingled with God, but neither God nor man will be annulled. The soul of a spiritual man is never annulled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT EPISTLES<br />
EXPRESSING THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The mingling of God and man is clearly seen in the Epistles of the apostles. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles have Paul&rsquo;s flavor, and John&rsquo;s Epistles have John&rsquo;s style. There are clear distinctions between the writings of Paul and John. If spirituality annuls our humanity, the style and flavor of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament would be the same. However, they are altogether distinct. These distinctions show that salvation does not annul our humanity but rather strengthens our humanity. Our salvation would be meaningless if it annulled our humanity. Before his salvation, Paul lived independently of God; he neither had the divine element in him, nor was he subject to the divine authority. However, after his salvation, Paul had the divine element, and he was subject to the divine authority. Furthermore, his human element was not annulled; instead, it was strengthened and enriched by the addition of the divine element. Since Paul was mingled with God, in his Epistles we can see not only Paul, but even more, we can see God. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles are not merely the speaking of the Holy Spirit; they are the speaking of the Holy Spirit mingled with Paul. Hence, we can say that they are Paul&rsquo;s speaking, and we can also say that they are God&rsquo;s speaking. Similarly, on the one hand, the Epistles by Peter, James, and John have the divine flavor, but on the other hand, they have the flavor of Peter, James, and John.</p>
<p>The more spiritual a person is, the more distinct his personality will be, because his personality will be mingled with God&rsquo;s personality. The twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem are not the same color. The foundations are precious stones, but each is distinct. There is jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase, jacinth, and amethyst (Rev. 21:19-20). Similarly, no two believers are exactly alike. Hence, we cannot imitate, replicate, or replace one another. Our Christ is so great that He needs millions of believers to express Him. The Old Testament presents many types of Christ, because He has many aspects that need to be expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST GOAL OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING<br />
THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Our fellowship with God does not annul our humanity. Rather, through fellowship divinity is mingled with humanity. This is the basic principle of God&rsquo;s work in His salvation. The purpose of salvation is not to annul man but to transform man. Furthermore, God is our salvation. The life and nature of God uplift and strengthen our humanity. It is not that man is fallen and thus needs to be saved. Even if man were not fallen, he would still need to be saved. We need to be saved not merely because we fell into sin, into the world, or have become flesh. We need to be saved because we, created men, are out of the earth, earthy. In order for an earthy man to become heavenly, he must go through the process of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Before Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, he was out of the earth (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:45-47), and thus he was earthy and was unrelated to heaven and the things in the heavenlies. He belonged to the earthly kingdom, not the heavenly kingdom. He needed to be saved in order to participate in the things of heaven. This can be likened to a person who is on the first floor of a house needing to ascend if he wants to be on the second floor. Adam was not only earthly and incompatible with the heavenly God, but he also lacked the life of God and was incompatible with God, who is life. People think that man needs to be regenerated because he is corrupt. However, even if man were not corrupt, he would still need to be regenerated because he lacks God&rsquo;s life. Even before Adam fell, while he was uncorrupted, he did not have the life of God; thus, he needed to be regenerated in order to have God&rsquo;s life and nature. Once we receive God&rsquo;s life and nature, our human nature is uplifted. Formerly, we were earthly men, but now we have become heavenly God-men.</p>
<p>Every saved person has a nature that is superior to Adam&rsquo;s nature. Adam was merely a man of dust, but every saved person is a man of gold. Although the believers have not yet become completely golden, they have the element of gold. Adam had a body that was created out of dust, but the body of a believer will one day be changed into a glorified body. Even though our body is still of dust, it has begun to change, because the element of God is in us. Hence, our body is gradually being uplifted in nature. Adam&rsquo;s spirit was not his person; it was a created, limited spirit. The spirit of a believer is mingled with God and has an uncreated element and an unlimited nature, that is, the divine Spirit. As a result, our spirit is superior to Adam&rsquo;s spirit. Hence, even if man had not fallen, he would still need salvation, because man is merely a creature without the uncreated element; he is earthly, not heavenly.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
