   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AS THE SPIRIT DWELLING IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today God has passed through His work of creation, incarnation, human living, and His redemptive death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has entered into resurrection and ascension, in which He has been enthroned, crowned, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has received the headship, lordship, and kingship over all of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since God has accomplished all this, He is no longer merely God the Creator, as in Genesis 1, not yet having passed through all His processes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the four Gospels He was incarnated and lived on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many believers wish that they could have been with the Lord as the disciples were.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps we have all thought that it would have been wonderful to touch Jesus, wash His feet, serve Him, and accompany Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During His earthly ministry, the Lord was able to be among the disciples, but He could not enter into them, because He had not yet died and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, today is actually the best time to live.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord was with the disciples, but He was not in them as He is in us today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The disciples had the Lord s visible presence, but we have His inward, invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to treasure the Lord s invisible presence, realizing how valuable it is that the Lord is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are living in the best age, the age of Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have Christ within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We who are living in this age are very much blessed, for we are indwelt by the Triune God who has gone through the procedures and processes of creation, incarnation, human living, His all-inclusive crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The God who has accomplished, obtained, and attained everything has come into us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8 shows that the Spirit today is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 9 Paul first says, The Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he continues in the same verse, Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 11 Paul says, The Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God here surely refers to the entire Triune God, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the Father is Spirit, the Son is Spirit, and of course, the Spirit is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because traditional theology overemphasizes the distinction among the three of the Trinity, some Christians today oppose the truth that Christ is the Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of caring for theology, which is a set of human concepts about God, we should care for the pure revelation of God in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible tells us that the entire God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, all three of the Godhead are Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 7:38 Jesus said, He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the writer, John, gives a kind of interpretation, saying, This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the Spirit is, because Jesus has been glorified through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some may be unfamiliar with terms such as the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, all believers know that God passed through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be incarnated, God was conceived in a virgin, grew in her womb, and was born of her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a birth was surely a process.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Further, God in Christ lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all kinds of experiences and sufferings of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This too was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His crucifixion was also a process.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, His passing through death and Hades and entering into resurrection were also processes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God today is different from God in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God the Creator in Genesis 1 possessed only divinity, but God today possesses also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Genesis 1 God was merely God, but today He is both God and man; He is fully God and fully man, the real God and a true man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is human as well as divine, possessing the human nature as well as the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Genesis 1 and even in the Gospels before John 20, God had no way to enter into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because He had not accomplished redemption, the requirements of His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory had not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The righteous, holy, glorious God could not come into fallen sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, in John 14:2-3 the Lord said to His disciples, In My Father s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord died to prepare the way so that He could bring us not into heaven but into the righteous, holy, and glorious God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ s death satisfied all the requirements of God His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moreover, Christ s resurrection brought His human body into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today in resurrection He possesses a glorious body, and He will make our body the same as His Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our God today is utterly complete in what He is, has done, and is able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has accomplished, obtained, and attained everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This God, who is complete, full, and perfect, is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The all-inclusive Spirit is the ultimate consummation and application of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God the Creator was mysterious and far away from us, but as the Spirit God is near and applicable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to see that the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God resides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although we may not recall every point that we have read in these chapters, we need to at least remember the good news that we live in an age in which the Triune God is fully processed, has accomplished everything, and is the applicable God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is in our mouth and in our heart, and if we only say, O Lord Jesus, He will come into us Rom 10:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>NEEDING TO LIVE CHRIST CONTINUALLY</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because we are genuine Christians, Christ has come into us to be our life, and we should live Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, we mostly live by many things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For instance, we often live by the traditions of our nationality or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of living as an American or a Chinese, we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because we have received the Lord s mercy and grace, we may hate sin, not commit gross sins, and even not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nevertheless, day after day we may still live by tradition, living Christ only for a short time each day.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although we do not live in sin or love the world, neither do we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Instead, we live by our tradition or habit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, as genuine believers in Christ, we should live only Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and is applied to us as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Spirit who resides in us is the ultimate consummation and application, or reaching, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is within us, expecting that we would walk according to Him, live by Him, and live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The genuine Christian life is not merely a sinless, perfect, and ethical life but a life that is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should live by and with Christ, and we should live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Christ should be our life within and our living without.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to live Christ continually.</S>
