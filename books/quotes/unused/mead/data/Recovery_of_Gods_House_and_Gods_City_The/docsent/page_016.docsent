   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIEST-PROPHET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Haggai mentions nothing further about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in the Bible, there is always the principle of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was not just one prophet sent to the people of recovery, but two.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord sent not only Haggai, but also Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is rather difficult for us to discover from what kind of family Haggai came.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Zechariah tells us clearly that he came from a priest's family; so he was a priest-prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His prophecy was based upon his priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He spoke very much concerning Christ because his ministry sprang from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today in the Lord's recovery, we need the prophets such as Haggai to strengthen us, warn us, and stir us, but we need prophets such as Zechariah even more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Haggai has two chapters, while Zechariah with fourteen chapters is seven times greater.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not need much of Haggai's ministry, but we do need much ministry from Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because Zechariah's ministry is the ministry of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today so many people assume the prophethood, but they do not have the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1960 a Pentecostal movement began on the west coast which was quite prevailing for three or four years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That movement has quieted down now due to a prophecy which was never fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1963 some in that movement prophesied that there would be a huge earthquake in Los Angeles in 1964.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I told the brothers not to be bothered by those kinds of movements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sooner or later, they will be terminated by their prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They prophesied, but there was no fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today in the recovery of the local church, we do not need that kind of prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need the priest-prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the prophets who are the real priests, who have living contact with the Lord and who know something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Read the book of Zechariah again and again, and you will see that he did not predict anything but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All he spoke about was Christ, because he was a priest contacting the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need Haggai, but we need Zechariah more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need Haggai one time, but Zechariah seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone understands the book of Haggai.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes" Hag 1:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is easy to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And he says, "Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts" 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everybody understands this kind of prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when you read Zechariah, it is not so easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white" Zech 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man was riding upon a red horse among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must tell Zechariah that he is not as simple as Haggai.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can understand what Haggai says, but we do not know what Zechariah is speaking about!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Zechariah we see something much deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, there was the man riding on a red horse among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then, there was the vision of the four horns with four carpenters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The third vision was the putting of the measuring line upon Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And the fourth vision showed Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is the angel of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While Joshua was standing before the angel, Satan was standing by him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And the angel of the Lord acted to change the clothing of Joshua, because Joshua's clothing, the basis for Satan's accusation, was so dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then he told Joshua that he would bring forth a stone, and this stone, with seven eyes, is the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does all this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fifth vision showed a golden lampstand with seven lamps and seven pipes full of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sixth vision concerned a flying roll.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How strange this is!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the flying roll, there was the measuring pot, which was called the ephah.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And the eighth vision was concerning four chariots.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What was Zechariah talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is much easier to understand an earthquake coming to Los Angeles!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, we must see that this mystery is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the recovery of the Lord's house today, we do not need the prophets like Haggai so much.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet today, nearly all the prophets are like Haggai.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Have you heard some prophecy about Christ as God's mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are too many Haggais, and hardly any Zechariahs.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Haggai only opens the way for the prophecy, and Zechariah follows.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the recovery of the local churches, we need more prophecies like Zechariah, more prophecies about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today we rarely hear the voice of Zechariah, because it is mysterious; it is something which is not according to human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need the heavenly vision to see the things concerning Christ related to the recovery of the building of God's house.</S>
