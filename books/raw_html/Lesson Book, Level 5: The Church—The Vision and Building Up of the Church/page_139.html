<p>The vision of Christ and His church delivered him from everything, and transferred him into Christ. He had been deeply involved with the Jewish religion. He was zealous for it. He tried his best to excel in the Jewish religion even to the extent of persecuting the church with threatening and murder. But he became blinded to all that at the sight of Christ and the church. He dropped everything and came to Christ for His church.<p>From the vision came a commission from the Lord. [Acts 26:17-18 says, “Taking you out from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.’’ These verses show us the five items of Saul’s commission: (l) to open their eyes; (2) to turn them from darkness to light; (3) to turn them from the authority of Satan to God; (4) that they may receive forgiveness of sins; (5) and that they may receive an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in the Lord Jesus.]<p>He was faithful to the vision and the commission. Immediately after his baptism, he proclaimed Jesus in Damascus, and gathered disciples (Acts 9:18, 20, 26). When he was persecuted, he went to Jerusalem and “spoke boldly in the name of the Lord’’ (Acts 9:28).<p>He had a strong beginning and continued even more strongly. He went throughout Asia minor and Europe to preach Christ (Acts 13-28), shepherd new believers (Acts 20:18-38), teaching them what he knew about the Lord (Acts 20:18-28), and establishing churches (Acts 13-28; 14:23; Titus 1:5). He was faithful to the end. He said in 2 Tim. 4:7-8, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing.’’ Because he was faithful, a crown was reserved for him.<p>You may say that Paul was special and that you could never be like him. We may never get a direct heavenly vision of Christ and the church as Paul did, but we can receive an indirect heavenly vision through the word of Paul’s ministry. There is actually no difference. The Lord said to Thomas in John 20:29, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.’’ We are those who have not seen and have believed. We are those who did not have a direct heavenly vision like Paul, yet we see from his ministry in his epistles. We are more blessed. But we must be faithful to what we have seen. Paul said in Philippians 3:17, “Be imitators together of me, brothers and observe attentively those who thus walk as you have us for an example.’’ He is our pattern. He went before us. He first saw the heavenly vision. All that he has seen is for us to receive and imitate as a pattern.<p>[This young man, Saul of Tarsus, is a real example to us. It may be that in the entire Scriptures only the Lord Jesus as a man could exceed this man Saul, who was later called Paul. Paul even told us in 1 Timothy that he was a pattern to the believers (1:16). Saul was religious and natural, yet one day he received the heavenly vision and was converted from all things other than Christ to Christ Himself. From that day he became very useful in the hand of God and had a prevailing impact. The Lord was able to accomplish many wonderful things through him. This is the kind of person whom God can use today. May we all go to the Lord and pray, “Lord, here I am. I am open to You, to Your vision, to Your commission, and I am ready to pay any cost, any price. I want to count all things loss and count only Christ as gain. I am ready to be occupied, possessed, and filled by Christ.’’ If we go to the Lord and spend some time with Him to receive the heavenly vision, we will have a living contact with Christ and be a living, functioning member of His living Body. Then we will be persons in God’s plan.]
