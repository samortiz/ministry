<p>It is true that the ones who did not return were all Israelites and were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and that they gathered together in different places. However, they stubbornly remained in Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon, in the lands of captivity, and would not obey God’s calling to pay the price to return to the holy land for the worship of God. Hence, they were in desolation and became deformed. Before their deformation, they were the proper Israelites, but after their deformation, they became scattered and divided. Although they were still Israelites, they had left the ground of oneness and were no longer the nation of Israel. After the expiration of the captivity, God commanded all the children of Israel to return to the proper ground, the ground of oneness, that is, Jerusalem. Thus, they should not have still remained in Assyria or Egypt, much less in Babylon, a place which was condemned by God. Even if they returned to Bethany, it was still not good enough; they had to go on to Jerusalem. In God’s eyes, the Israelites who did not return to Jerusalem were not the nation of Israel. Likewise, in God’s eyes, Christians who do not return to the proper ground to worship God are not the church in practicality.<p>The Jews today are an illustration of this situation. At present there are about fourteen million Jews on the whole earth. The nation of Israel, however, is in the land of Palestine. There are only three and a half million Jews in Palestine, yet in New York alone there are over three million Jews, and in addition, there are over seven million Jews elsewhere. Which of them, then, is the nation of Israel? The Jews in New York may be very willing to contribute and donate to help build up Israel’s national defense and economic development, but they are still not the nation of Israel. To be the nation of Israel or be a part of the nation of Israel, one must return to the land of Israel and fulfill his obligations as a citizen of Israel by paying taxes and serving in the military. Herein is the difference; many Israelites gathering together are not necessarily the nation of Israel. Only the Israelites who are on the proper ground are the nation of Israel. Likewise, many Christians meeting together may not be the church; only those who stand on the unique ground ordained by God are the church. This is a very clear illustration.<p>At first the church was composed of all Christians. However, the church became desolated and was divided in captivity. Revelation 17 and 18 refer to Babylon the Great. Bible teachers acknowledge that Babylon the Great in chapter seventeen refers to the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Church is the great religious Babylon that carried God’s people into captivity. In Revelation, Babylon is a great harlot who brought forth many daughters (17:5). The Protestant churches broke away from the Catholic Church in name to become many sects, yet in principle, most of them did not break away from the teaching, practices, and traditions of the Catholic Church. Thus, they became her many daughters. Christianity today has carried Christians away from the normal and proper condition of the church and eventually has caused them to be scattered. This is the fulfillment of the type of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament.<p>In their captivity some Christians saw God’s revelation and knew that they ought to return from the land of their captivity. However, some only saw the need to return, yet did not see the proper ground to which they should return. As a result, they stopped halfway and became what Brother Nee called the “halfway cabins.” Thank the Lord that we have come back to the proper ground. Today we are those who have returned from the land of captivity. We are not in the Catholic Church, nor in the denominations, nor in a “halfway cabin,” but on the proper ground.<p>In the ancient time, all the children of Israel knew that they had to return, but only a small number of them returned. Today it is the same. Only we, a few people, have returned. Hence, the proper, normal church today is not the Catholic Church, nor the different Christian denominations and groups, but the few of us who have returned. The saved believers in the Catholic Church and in the different Christian denominations and groups are also components of the church, but they are not the church in practicality. This is similar to the situation of the Israelites in different places. As Israelites, they ought to be the components of the nation of Israel. Nevertheless, because they have not returned to the nation of Israel, they have no share in the formation of the nation of Israel. Today, the majority of Christians are scattered in the Catholic Church and in different Christian denominations and groups. As genuine Christians, they are components of the church, yet they are separated from the church and have no share in the church. Therefore, in the eyes of God, they are not the church, just as the children of Israel who are scattered everywhere are not the nation of Israel.<p>Only the returned Israelites were the nation of Israel. This is because they returned to Jerusalem to recover the proper worship to God and rebuild the temple and the city. As a result, God could also return to Zion (Zech. 8:3), and the glory of God could again be expressed through them. In figure, today, only we who have come out of the Catholic Church and the different Christian denominations and groups are the church. This is because we have separated ourselves from human opinions and organization and have returned to the original ground of the church, the ground of one locality with one church, to meet and worship in spirit as a testimony of the Lord (John 4:24). Therefore, every saved believer should come to the normal church instead of remaining in deformed Christianity.
