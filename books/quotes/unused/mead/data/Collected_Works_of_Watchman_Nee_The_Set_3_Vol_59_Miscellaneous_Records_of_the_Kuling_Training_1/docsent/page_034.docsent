   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH 2 Date:June 20, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading:Eph 1:19 DEATH BEING THE GREATEST LIMITATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last Lord's Day we spoke about resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today I will add a few words based on our Scripture reading.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Last Lord's Day we saw how death is a great limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have to repeat and emphasize this point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All living creatures meet their end when they die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Death is the greatest limitation to a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A small animal ceases to exist when it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A large animal also ceases to exist when it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every living organism, whether it is a plant or an animal, is limited by death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same is true with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if a man's mind becomes more clever than it is today and even if he makes plans for himself like the rich man in the Lord's parable, whom God called "foolish," he is finished once God calls for his soul Luke 12:16-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of our loved ones, our father, mother, and children, are gone once they die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one can call them back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This can be said of all the great men of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter how powerful they are and what position they hold, they are finished once they die.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death is the greatest limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GOD BEING AFTER A MAN OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord was on the earth, He was a prototype of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a prototype during the first forty days after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the thirty-three and a half years He lived on the earth, He was a prototype of human moral virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During the forty days after His resurrection, He was a prototype of power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These forty days speak of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For years orthodox theology has acknowledged that the earthly Lord Jesus is a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It views the Lord's death as a satisfaction of God's requirement, without which God would condemn us for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We failed and were under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unless the Lord died for us and the veil of the Holy of Holies was rent for us, we would never have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We would be condemned instead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, theologians in the past have not seen the truth of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only after 1926 did men begin to see the truth about resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only He who passed through resurrection can fulfill God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrews 1:5 says, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This word refers to the Lord's ascent from the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After His resurrection, the Lord rose from the grave, and God said to Him, "This day have I begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God said, "This day have I begotten You," He had found the man He was after.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we became God's sons on the day of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the fall, man has come short of the glory of God Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unless we pass through resurrection, we cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have come short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is the only One who has not come short of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord is the only perfect man, but God needs something more than a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has an additional demand: Such a perfect man must also be a man of power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's need is not only a moral man but a man of power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since His birth at Bethlehem, the Lord was a moral man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But after His resurrection, He was manifested to be a man of power.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After His resurrection, He became omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Time and space could limit Him no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He became a man endowed with resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is now the man God wants, and God's plan of creating man is fulfilled.</S>
