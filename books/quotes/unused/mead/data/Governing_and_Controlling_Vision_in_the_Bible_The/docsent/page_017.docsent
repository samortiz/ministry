   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Bringing Forth Simultaneously</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Many Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After His resurrection Christ still possesses divinity and humanity, but His humanity has been uplifted and joined with His divinity through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that He was begotten to be the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So it is with our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were human beings with the human nature, but we were without the divine life and had no share in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time of our regeneration, when the life of God entered into us, we were born again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were regenerated in the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Christ was designated in His humanity to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness the divinity of Christ , we were also designated with Him as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were born with Christ in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this delivery, He was the first One, so He was the firstborn Son; we were those who came after Him, so we were the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The many sons of God and the firstborn Son of God were born at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a revelation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the crystallization of our study, which is not seen in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not only the brothers of Christ, but even more we are genuine brothers born with Him in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as His flesh His human nature was begotten of the divine nature and the divine life, so also our human nature is begotten of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, we all have become the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, born with Him in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two thousand years ago, before we were born of our parents, we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to man s natural understanding, this principle is illogical, but with God there is no time factor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we have not seen the New Jerusalem, but in Revelation the predicates used concerning the New Jerusalem are all in the past tense because in God s eyes the New Jerusalem has long been in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Peter 1:3 explicitly says that God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 2:5 says that even when we were dead in our offenses and sins, God made us alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This, however, was still not resurrection; we were simply made alive out of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 6 goes on to say that God raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ was resurrected two thousand years ago, when we were not yet born, yet in God s eyes we were resurrected together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should believe this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ as the Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Becoming the Life-giving Spirit in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that in His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God became flesh and was born as Jesus, but in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul refers to the last Adam instead of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to our natural understanding, there were millions of Adams after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since neither you nor I are the last Adam, how can Christ be the last Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a question is in the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In God s eyes Christ as the last Adam was the conclusion because we were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we could be crucified with Him on the cross at His crucifixion Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unless we were included in Him, we could not be crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christian theology teaches that His death is merely reckoned as our death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not that His death is merely reckoned as our death; rather, His death is our death because we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can use an illustration here: Many Americans came to the United States in the loins of their forefathers, who boarded the Mayflower to come to the new continent and were thereby born as Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hebrews 7:9-10 says that Levi was in Abraham s loins when Abraham offered tithes to Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Levi, who was the fourth generation of Abraham s descendants, was not yet born, but in God s eyes he was already in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same principle, when did we first sin?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We sinned in Adam when he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we also ate it in him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the biblical view.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what it means to be in Adam 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Adam means that Adam includes us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, in Christ means that Christ includes us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ as the last Adam included us in Him when He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit referred to in John 7:39: But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jesus was glorified in His resurrection Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The resurrection of Jesus was His glorification 1 Cor 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once Jesus was glorified, the Spirit, the consummated Spirit, was there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today the Spirit is the consummated, compound, all-inclusive, indwelling, and sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit was consummated by passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Spirit is also the compound Spirit, compounded with God and man plus the element of Christ s death with its effectiveness and the element of Christ s resurrection with its power Exo 30:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such a Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ with the bountiful supply Phil 1:19 .</S>
