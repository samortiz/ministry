<p class="bold">WEEK 5 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 7:21-27</h2><p class="bold">21 &nbsp;Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will <sup>1</sup>enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.</p><p>22 &nbsp;Many will say to Me in <sup>1</sup>that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?</p><p>23 &nbsp;And then I will declare to them: I never <sup>1</sup>knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.</p><p class="bold">24 &nbsp;Every one therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the <sup>1</sup>rock.</p> <p class="bold">25 &nbsp;And the <sup>1</sup>rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did <sup>2</sup>not fall, for it was founded on the rock.</p> <p>26 &nbsp;And every one who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the <sup>1</sup>sand.</p> <p>27 &nbsp;And the rain descended,…the rivers came, and the winds blew… against that house; and…its <sup>1</sup>fall was great.</p><h2 class="head1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>21<sup>1</sup> To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (Rom. 10:13), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Hence, not everyone who says, “Lord, Lord,” will enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but those who call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father will enter in.</p><p>Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration (John 3:3, 5). The latter entrance is gained through being born of the divine life; the former, through the living of that life.</p><p>22<sup>1</sup> That day refers to the day of the judgment seat of Christ (1 Cor. 3:13; 4:5; 2 Cor. 5:10).</p><p>23<sup>1</sup> Knew here means approved. The same word in Rom. 7:15 is translated acknowledge. The Lord never approved those who, in His name, prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power (v. 22), but did those things not according to the will of the heavenly Father (v. 21). The Lord did not deny that they did those things, but He considered those things lawlessness because they were not done according to the will of the heavenly Father; they were not done in line with the divine will. Thus, those who do such things, even in the Lord’s name, will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but will depart from the Lord, that is, be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age.</p><p>24<sup>1</sup> Rock does not refer to Christ but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father who is in the heavens. The living and work of the kingdom people must be founded on the word of the new King for the accomplishing of the will of the heavenly Father. This is to enter in through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way that leads to life.</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> The rain, which descends from the heavens, is of God; the rivers, which come from the earth, are of man; and the winds, which blow from the air, are of Satan. All these will test the living and work of the kingdom people.</p><p>25<sup>2</sup> The house built on the rock, a house that does not fall, is like the work that is built with gold, silver, and precious stones, a work that can stand the testing fire (1 Cor. 3:12-13).</p><p>26<sup>1</sup> Sand refers to human concepts and natural ways. If we live and work according to our human concepts and natural ways, our living and work will be founded on sinking sand. This is to enter in through the wide gate and walk the broad way that leads to destruction.</p><p>27<sup>1</sup> The house built on sand…falls, [and] is like the work that is built with wood, hay, and stubble, a work that will be burned by the testing fire…(1 Cor. 3:12-15).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 302-308; Hymns: #947</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
