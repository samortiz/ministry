<h1 class="title">THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 3:9-20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>All are under sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is born in sin.</li>
	<li>Man grows up in sin.</li>
	<li>Man lives in sin.</li>
	<li>Man wallows in sin.</li>
	<li>All men are under sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is none righteous
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A righteous man is just and faultless before God.</li>
	<li>Using &ldquo;just and faultless&rdquo; as a yardstick to measure a man, we find that there is none righteous, because man is not normal toward God and is not just toward man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is none that does good
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Righteousness&rdquo; is up to the standard of justice, but &ldquo;good&rdquo; is exceeding the standard of justice. Whenever you do something more than what you ought to do, you are doing something that is good. For example, you hired a servant and promised to pay him $600 monthly. If you pay him only $580, you have done something unrighteous. If you give him $650, you have done something good.</li>
	<li>But even if you do something good, there is none that can do good out of a pure heart. Most good works contain side effects which expose that the heart is not pure. Consequently, there is none that does good, not even one.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The conditions of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There is none that understands. All are confused and foolish, not knowing how to behave themselves before God and before men.</li>
	<li>There is none that seeks God who is the source of righteousness, the origin of all good. There is none that seeks Him; therefore there is none righteous and none that does good.</li>
	<li>All have turned aside.</li>
	<li>All have together become useless.</li>
	<li>Their throat is an open grave. Everything that comes out of men is stinking and dead.</li>
	<li>Their tongues work deceit.</li>
	<li>The poison of asps is under their lips.</li>
	<li>Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.</li>
	<li>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</li>
	<li>Ruin and misery are in their ways.</li>
	<li>They know not the way of peace.</li>
	<li>There is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
	After talking about these twelve points of man&rsquo;s condition, all will have to bow down their heads and confess that there is none righteous, none that does good, not even one.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The world is under the condemnation of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man has sins, and God has the law. The sins of man conflict with the law of God.</li>
	<li>According to His law, God has to condemn man.</li>
	<li>Since all have sinned, all are under God&rsquo;s condemnation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How can a man become righteous?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are not righteous, neither can you become righteous. In other words, admit that you have no righteousness, and that you can do nothing that is righteous.</li>
	<li>Believe in the Lord Jesus, and receive Him as your righteousness.</li>
	<li>Receive the Lord Jesus as your living Savior. He makes you righteous and causes you to live out His righteousness.</li>
	</ol></li>
