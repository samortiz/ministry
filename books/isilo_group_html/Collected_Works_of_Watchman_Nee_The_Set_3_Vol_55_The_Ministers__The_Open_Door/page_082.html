Due to the desperate situation, we intend to tear down our old meeting hall at Kuanjie next spring and build a new, bigger meeting hall that will be able to hold eight hundred to a thousand people. (The new meeting hall has been completed.&mdash;Editor)</p><p>Recently, many people who are seeking the Lord have been raised up in many places. There are brothers in some places in Hopeh province who have found their way to Peking to fellowship with us. They wanted us to go to them and lead them. The brothers from Ch'ang-ch'un, Manchuria, and other places in the Northeast have also sent several letters imploring us to go there because the brothers are truly hungry and thirsty. Many who seek the Lord in the various denominations have expressed the desire to come to join us.</p><p>God has greatly blessed the entire area of Suiyuan, and the meetings increase gradually. The brothers and sisters also are desperate for the Lord, and all the churches zealously preach the gospel. The Lord has really saved many sinners. During the winter season, more than sixty young brothers and sisters met for more than four weeks at Baotou. They received much of the Lord's mercy.</p><p>Caleb Yen<br />January 23, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 9 Kuanjie, An Nei, Peking</p><h2 class="head2">What Is the Reason for Little Fruit in the Gospel? (Pingliang)</h2><p>In Pingliang we preached the gospel four times over the New Year, and only three brothers and one sister were baptized yesterday. Thank God! Brother Wang Zhi-xiao's father was also baptized at this time. There has been very little fruit in the gospel over the past few months. We do not know if it is because we do not do enough visiting or if there is another spiritual reason. Please instruct us and pray for us much.</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Wang Zhi-xiao, Lian Qi-xiu, You Ling-chuan<br />January 9, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 61 Fuxing Road, Pingliang, Kansu province</p><h2 class="head2">Moving to Yiyang (Kiangsi Province)</h2><p>Through the love of the brothers and sisters on the farm, I have been received into the cooperative farm here. My work has been assigned as well. I belong to the group managing the storeroom, and my wife does the work of making clothes. Yue-xu (my child) is learning to be a farmer. With regard to the coordination in the service of the church in Yangshuchiao, I am in the gospel service group and the ushering service group. In the matter of the corporate living, I deeply desire to place myself before the elder brothers and sisters and to live together with them. I ask the Lord not to allow me to fall into error again.</p><p>A weak member,<br />Lee Wen-fu<br />June 25, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministers & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 82</div><br></body></html>
