   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FEASTING ON CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of 1 Corinthians there are many feathers, and there is a great deal of skin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in our spiritual cooking we need to pay more attention to the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most readers of 1 Corinthians 5 pay attention to an uncomely feather, the case of the sinful brother who committed incest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In reading this chapter we cannot avoid this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this is not the only matter covered in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verses 7 and 8 Paul says, For indeed our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us therefore keep the feast....</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul s word about the Passover and keeping the feast is not skin or feathers it is meat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here Paul indicates that we are keeping the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is our Passover and our feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can enjoy Him and feast on Him throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The feast of unleavened bread lasted for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These seven days typify the entire course of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, during our whole Christian life, Christ is our feast, our unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we feast on Him, the more we become unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A HELP IN STUDYING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By comparing the meat in 1 Corinthians 5 with the feathers, we learn the proper way to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we read the Bible, we need to pay attention not only to the feathers and the skin, but much more to the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that this word concerning the feathers, the skin, and the meat will be helpful to us in our reading of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ASPECTS OF THE PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that Paul is a pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we must go on to ask what kind of person Paul was as such a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The answer to this question is that Paul was an attached person, a person attached to Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, But He Who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anyone who is not attached to Christ, any unattached person, cannot live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would live Christ for the church, we must learn of Paul as our pattern to be a person attached to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 1:21, those who are attached to Christ are anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, one who lives Christ for the church must be an anointed person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not sufficient to be educated, instructed, or trained; we must be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are not anointed, we cannot live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1:22 Paul goes on to say that God has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One who lives Christ for the church is also a person who has been sealed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be sealed by God means to be owned, possessed, by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have not been sealed by God, we cannot live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2:14 Paul says, But thanks be to God, Who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have pointed out, the verb leads us in triumph means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in this verse Paul refers to being captured by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the human concept, it is not a good thing to be captured.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one wants to be a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we need to be captured by the Lord so that we may live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also need to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, neither the brothers nor the sisters like to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is surely very difficult for a young woman to be subdued by her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, her attitude may be that even though she married her husband, she has no intention of being subdued by him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Naturally speaking, none of us likes to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For us, it is humiliating to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, if we would live Christ for the church, we must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not humiliating to be subdued by the Lord it is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, if we would live Christ for the church, we must be led by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be captured, subdued, and led.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We, however, prefer to lead others, not to be led by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would live Christ for the church, we all need to be led.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Concerning living Christ for the church, we have listed six matters: attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we shall see in the next message, all this is that we may scatter the incense of Christ.</S>
