   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Saul said, "Therefore said I" v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That was not a command from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, God wants us to serve Him according to His instruction; He does not want us to serve according to what we think or presume.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every work that originates from our thinking and presumption is rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is after those who are after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's heart is not on what we do but on our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is something that every servant of the Lord should remember.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times we are like Saul; we cannot wait to engage ourselves in many works.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We find it hard to believe that God is ever late, and we cannot wait for His timing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We only see our needs and the needs of the environment, and we forget to wait on God's timing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result we do what God has not commanded us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Saul was rejected by God for his over-zealousness and his over-eagerness to offer sacrifices and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had many reasons for doing this, but God found a man after His own heart, whom He could appoint to be the ruler of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The man God is after is not one who is impatient; he is one who is after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we were there, we would surely have loved a man like Saul because he was an outstanding person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Saul stood among the people, he was a head taller than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God is not after outstanding persons; He is after those who are after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the goal of our service not be a great work or our own or others' approval but the heart of God and His acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God can only use such people, and He is looking for such people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Read 2 Samuel 6:1-7: "Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark....And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they read this portion, many people ask why God did this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Uzzah stretched out his hand to uphold the ark of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He should have been rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why did God immediately kill him instead?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's glory was with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Was it not a good thing for Uzzah to uphold the ark?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why did God smite him instead?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only reason is that God cares for obedience to His will more than help in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does not need anyone to uphold His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whoever touches the ark is smitten by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The issue here is not the consequence of the ark falling down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The issue here is whether or not God has commanded a person to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man thinks that the ark should not be touched at ordinary times but that it is all right to touch it and keep it from falling when it is in peril.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He thinks that he will not be punished by death, because this is a provisional move.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But with God there are only eternal edicts; there is no such thing as provisional measures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man does what God has not commanded him to do, he dies either physically or spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God did not ask whether the work was good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not ask for help; rather, He said that man's hand should not touch the ark and that whoever touched it would die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God would rather see His ark fall than have men help Him without His command.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times when we see outward needs, we try to help God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How terrible it is when God's servants try to do what Uzzah did; they try to help God's work with a fleshly hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The result is God's judgment!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, we must remember that we should only pay attention to God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who make provisional moves because of circumstantial needs and who do not wait on God's command will never please God in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can allow our work to temporarily and superficially fail, but God's sovereign right cannot be set aside, and man's flesh cannot be left unchecked.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has no need for man to uphold His work with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His intention is to judge all fleshly activities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people try to do what God has not told them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They try to please God according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They strive to do what God has not commanded them to do and do not realize that they are not pleasing God but rather are inviting His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we were sinners, we walked according to our own wisdom and did many things contrary to God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now that we are saved, we still think that we can exercise our own wisdom to serve God and help Him according to what we think is right.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Little do we realize that when we were sinners, it was a sin for us to oppose God with our own wisdom, and now that we are saved, it is equally a sin to help God in His work with our own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God does not need us to help Him with our own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God does not like to see man opposing Him with his own wisdom, and He does not like to see man helping Him with his own wisdom either.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God does not need man to help His work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must accept the principle of the cross and deny the activities of the self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must be willing to put our flesh to death and lose our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever we act according to our own will and think that by so doing we will revive God's work, it shows that we have not denied the self and do not know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A man must be brought to a "zero" position before God can use him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May none of us be presumptuous, and may we not disrupt God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should only care for God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if the work falls, we cannot uphold it with the hand of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can only do what God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God does not want us to be responsible for what is not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if everything falls down beside us, God will not rebuke us for it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Strictly speaking, presumptuousness is the result of human wisdom being unchecked by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What God requires today is for us to hold fast to this fact: We should only do what God commands us to do and not do what He has not commanded us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to maintain this stand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Perhaps some will think that this way is too narrow and that their work will become too common.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But brothers and sisters, that day will show whether or not this is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When that day comes, we will see that all works apart from God's will are unapproved and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The judgment seat will reveal all works apart from God's will to be nothing but reasons for rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Second Chronicles 26:16-21 tells the story of King Uzziah entering Jehovah's temple according to his own will and burning incense on the altar of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He was subsequently punished by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God's ordinance allowed only the sons of Aaron to inherit the holy office and be priests; only they could enter the temple to burn incense.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No one else was allowed to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But Uzziah insisted.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was proud to enter the temple and burn incense.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God punished him, and leprosy broke out in his forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This story is a big warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can never rashly do what God has not commanded us to do; otherwise, we will suffer God's punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Spiritually speaking, leprosy signifies the filth of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All those who act presumptuously without God's command have committed a filthy sin before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Man's zeal is useless in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Man cannot direct God's work with his zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It was a good thing to enter the temple and to burn the incense, but since it was not done in accordance with God's will, it became a punishable sin.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>King Uzziah entered the temple presumptuously to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He offended God and was struck with leprosy until the day he died.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is a serious warning for our consideration.</S>
