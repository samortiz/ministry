This refers to the future. In the coming kingdom, the Lord will make us a kingdom of priests. At that time we shall not only be priests individually, but we shall be joined together to be a priesthood, as a kingdom. This means we shall all be priests. We are "a royal priesthood," "to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:9, 5). "Royal" means kingly. When the kingdom comes, we shall not only be priests, but we shall also be kings and priests. We shall be kings. This, however, refers to the future and not to the present. In the future, we shall reign with the Lord and receive the incomparably great glory. This will be realized in the kingdom. As for now, we are joined together with God's High Priest to be priests in the Holy of Holies. We ought to serve the Lord with all of our heart and forget about the gain and loss in the world. We should not seek after the transient world. Our hope is in the future. May the Lord discipline us so that we will discipline ourselves not to covet or to envy the vanity under the sun. Let people look down on us, ridicule us, hate us, and ill-treat us! We have the brightest future! Now we are hidden by the veil; we are small and unnoticed. The day will come soon, however, when we shall have the authority to rule, whose sphere will be the whole earth, and whose duration will be eternity. May we receive more grace to be the priests to serve God and the kings to carry out God's will on the earth. May we be absolute for God.</P><P>Here, we ought to pay attention to one thing. Our being kings and priests is based on the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Because of the shedding of His blood, our sins are forgiven. It is because of the shedding of His blood that we can be kings. Why did He shed His blood? Because He loves us. Our being kings is based completely on His love and grace. If this is the case, does it mean that all the saints will be kings in the millennial kingdom? There are many places in the Scripture which answer, "No." If to be kings is a matter of grace, why cannot all believers be kings? We have to realize one thing: God's grace has prepared salvation for all men, but are all the people on the earth saved? No. Why is this so? It is because some of them do not believe. They do not accept God's grace by faith. In the same way, God's grace has prepared a glory, that is, a kingship, for the entire church. Yet, because the saints do not have the act of faith to receive God's grace, they cannot all be kings. Not all men on earth are saved; not all saints are granted to be kings. Therefore, we all need to be very careful. We should not go to extremes. It is fully the Lord's grace that believers are made kings. We have no merit in this at all. Yet it does not mean that because of the Lord's grace the responsibility of the saints is annulled. Our responsibility is to receive this grace by the act of faith. If we believe that we shall obtain glory in the future, can we still covet the present glory? If we believe that we shall be kings in the millennial kingdom, can we still admire the great men of this world? Therefore, our being kings is by grace and is also by works. Without suffering we cannot be kings. Our suffering is the means through which we receive the glory. For the sake of the glory to be manifested in the future, may we once again guard our hearts from being attracted by the world!</P><P>"To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever!" When the saints hear the name of the Lord Jesus, they are reminded of His works. It is when we consider how He loves us and how in love He shed His blood for us that we may receive the glory, that we cannot refrain from raising our voices in singing: "To him be the glory and the might forever and ever!" Our praising the Lord is not because we have strong feelings or special experiences. We praise because of His unchanging love. Our voice of praise should not be uttered according to our wavering feelings and poor experiences. We should praise the Lord because of the Lord Himself. We should see how He has saved us in the past, how He will glorify us in the future, and how He loves us now. We should consider Him, His works, His person, and Himself. This will make us able and willing to praise Him regardless of our condition, and in this way we will certainly give all the glory and might to Him. Even in eternity this will be the way we praise Him.</P><P>Here, the "Amen" is added so that our individual voice can echo with the churches' voice. It is indeed a blessing to be able to share a place among the innumerable multitude, having the same theme and the same joy. Yet it is equally a blessing if we can utter with our own voice and express our own joy individually. The apostle said He "loved me and gave Himself for me." Is there not a difference between this and He "loved us and gave Himself for us?" Our individual voice should not be lost in the multitude. Each one of us should have things which we can praise the Lord for. A particular experience results in a particular song. May we all have our own "Amen" to harmonize with the joyful noise of the multitude. When one's heart responds to the love of the Lord, he is ready to testify for the Lord. When one receives grace, he sings praise, and after he sings the praises, he should tell the world of what he has. If one is with Christ, he will want to bear witness for Him in the world. One who has the same kind of life as Enoch's will undoubtedly have the same testimony as Enoch's. "And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him" (Gen. 5:24). This is he that testified, "Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints." The saints of God living in this world should be like Enoch, walking with God and witnessing for God. If we read the following verse, we will see how the faithful saints raised their voices for the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
