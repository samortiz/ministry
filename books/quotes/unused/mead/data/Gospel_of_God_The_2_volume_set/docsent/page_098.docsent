   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here lies the difference between Christianity and Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Judaism says to the man in the flesh that in keeping the law he shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But Christianity says he cannot live, for he cannot keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christianity asserts clearly that man cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no possibility for him to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we can see that in the Old Testament, God gave the law for man to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, we see that man cannot keep the law at all, nor does he have to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is one of the greatest truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now there is a danger of mixing faith and the law together, and annulling the principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Right away, Adam will have the ground, and the fleshly man will be able to live again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's judgment is that man must die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through Jesus Christ, God has removed man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not want the fleshly man to come up with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If man still tries to produce something from the flesh, he has overturned the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the law is given some ground, then the flesh also will have some ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God says that the flesh has no ground, that all grounds have been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may wonder whether this is to annul the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please remember that according to the Bible, the law requires two things from us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, the law says that he who keeps it shall live Rom 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law demands us to keep and to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once man keeps it, he will have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have righteousness, we will have the reward, which is life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But there is a second aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The law says that the day we eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, we shall surely die Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the law requires man to keep something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, its punishment is death for all those who do not keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All who do not keep the law receive the recompense of not keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, in the Old Testament, in principle, we see that the law required man to keep it and to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who did not keep it were condemned and punished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Shanghai, the traffic department has many traffic regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, to ride after dark, one has to have lights on his bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is no light for the bicycle, then there will be a fine of sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This regulation requires two things: it requires man to install a light, and it requires those who do not do this to be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What then is to annul the law?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To annul the law means that one does not need a light, and he does not have to be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is to keep the law?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To keep the law is to meet either of the two requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For those who have a light, they are keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For those who do not have a light, but are willing to pay sixty cents, they are also keeping the law.</S>
