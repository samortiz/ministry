   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX BREAKING AND DISCIPLINE CONSECRATION AND DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for our outer man to be broken, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consecration, however, does not take care of all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is only an expression of our intention to willingly give ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and unequivocally to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can consecrate ourselves to God in just a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This willingness to offer ourselves unreservedly to Him only constitutes the initial step in our spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not mean that God has finished all of His work with this one step.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not a man can be used by God does not depend on consecration alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After consecration there is still the need of discipline from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very important, and whether or not we will become useful to God depends a great deal on this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit must be added to our consecration before we can become a useful vessel to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without consecration, it often will be hard to go on with the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, consecration alone cannot replace the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we have to turn our attention to the matter of the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In consecration we offer ourselves to God according to the light we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In disciplining us the Holy Spirit deals with us according to the light that He dispenses to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can only consecrate according to what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only consecrate according to what we can see with our spiritual eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In reality even we do not know how much is included in our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The amount of light we have received is not infinite; our light is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even when we think that we have the greatest light, God's eyes still may find us in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we consecrate to God according to our perceived light will never satisfy His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, God's demand is always higher than what we can offer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our consecration cannot satisfy God's heart because our knowledge is limited and our light is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the discipline of the Holy Spirit is altogether different; it evaluates our need in God's own light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not what we see, but what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He knows that we have certain needs, and He operates through His Spirit in the environment for us to experience these things, the purpose of which is to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the disciplining work of the Holy Spirit goes far beyond our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is many times greater than our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a big difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The work of the Holy Spirit is based on the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit works according to what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, only the discipline of the Holy Spirit is thorough and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We often are ignorant in ourselves; we do not know what we need to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even our wisest choices are full of errors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we think we need often is not what we actually need according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we see from our side may only be a tiny fraction of the whole picture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit, however, orders things for us according to God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit far exceeds what our mind can fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We often are not prepared for a certain discipline, and we think that there is no need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Spirit's discipline does come upon us, we are taken by surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What the Spirit has ordered for us in the environment is not what we expected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Much discipline from the Holy Spirit comes without any warning from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suddenly we are struck with a heavy blow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may think that we are living under God's light, but to God this light may be a very feeble flicker.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He may not even consider it as light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit, however, deals with us according to God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We think that we know our condition, but actually we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only God knows us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the time we accepted Him, He has been ordering our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything that He has ordered is for our greatest benefit because He knows us and He knows our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The work of the Holy Spirit in us has a positive aspect and a negative aspect to it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a building-up aspect and a tearing-down aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit lives in us, yet our outer man limits His freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is like a man wearing a pair of new shoes; the shoes are too stiff and tight, and he finds it difficult to walk in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The outer man gives the inner man a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The inner man cannot control the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason that God has been dealing with our outer man and breaking it from the day we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God does not deal with our outer man according to our perceived need but according to our need as He sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He finds out what is tenacious in us and what is beyond the control of the inner man, and He deals with us according to what He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Holy Spirit does not deal with our outer man by strengthening our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He does not deal with it by supplying our inner man with more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean that the inner man does not need to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It means that God has a different way of dealing with the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Holy Spirit diminishes our outer man by means of outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not too easy to tackle the outer man with the inner man, because they are of different natures.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is hard for the inner man to bruise or crush the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The nature of the outer man corresponds to the nature of outward things; the outer man is easily affected by the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The outward things can crush, inflict pain, and bruise the outer man much better than the inner man can.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, God deals with our outer man with outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Matthew 10:29 says, "Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Luke 12:6 says, "Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One assarion buys two sparrows, and two assaria buy five.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The fifth one is a bonus; it is free.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yet, "not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father" Matt 10:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible also says, "Even the hairs of your head are all numbered" v. 30 . Not only are all the hairs counted; they are numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This leads us to realize that everything that happens to a Christian is under God's ordering.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No environment comes to us by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God wants us to see that everything is under His sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God arranges all these things according to our need as He sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He knows what is best for our inner man and how best to break and dismantle our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He knows that a certain thing will break our outer man, and He orders it to come upon us once, twice, and again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to see that all the things we have encountered during the past five or ten years have all been under God's ordering and are for our education.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we murmur against any person, we are indeed ignorant of God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we think that it was bouts of bad luck, we have no idea what the discipline of the Holy Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to remember that all the things that come upon us are measured by our God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All these are for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We may not know to choose them, but God knows that they are for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I am not sure what misery we would have fallen into had it not been for such discipline from God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Such arrangements keep us pure; they preserve us in God's pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are the best for us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God can give us nothing better.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Many people cannot submit themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They murmur with their mouth and resent in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is indeed foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to remember that everything is measured to us by the Holy Spirit and is the best that it can be.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>As soon as a person is saved, the Holy Spirit begins this work.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But a period of time has to lapse before He can gain full liberty through this work.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When does the Holy Spirit have the full liberty?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is when we consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The day that a man is saved is the day that the Holy Spirit begins the disciplining work, and the day that he consecrates himself is the day that the Holy Spirit has the full freedom to perform such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>After a man is saved and before he is consecrated, he still loves himself dearly and has little love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>One cannot say that the Holy Spirit is not disciplining him; He does order things to bring him to God and to break his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But with an unconsecrated man, He does not have the full liberty to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After a man is enlightened by God and has consecrated himself to God, the Holy Spirit will have the liberty to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>At a certain point, a man will feel that he can no longer live by himself or for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Under the feeble light that he apprehends, he will come to God and say, "I consecrate myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Whether the outcome is death or life, I will consecrate myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When this happens, the Holy Spirit's work in him will be intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Consecration is important.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Through consecration we allow the Holy Spirit to have the full and unconditional freedom to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We should not be surprised when many things come upon us unexpectedly after we have consecrated ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The only reason for such things to come upon us is that we have committed ourselves unconditionally to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We have said, "Lord, accomplish in me what is most profitable in Your sight!"</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Because we consecrated ourselves in this way, the Holy Spirit is free to do His work in us without concern for resistance on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Either we do not take the Lord's way at all, or if we do, we have to pay the utmost attention to the disciplining work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
