   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 7 and 8 say, "Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "fear" in verse 8 can be translated as "warning."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The answer is interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The question in verse 6 concerns the maiden, whereas the answer concerns the King.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does the "bed" refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It refers to Solomon's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A bed is something for the night, the time when darkness reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There should be no rest when darkness reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet Solomon was able to have his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The night was not void of warnings, yet he could still have his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, this refers to Christ's victory and how He has overcome the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Around the bed are sixty valiant men, every one of them has a sword; the swords are upon their thighs, and they are experts in war.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are all valiant men of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of these expressions mean that the bed of Solomon is ready to deal with the warnings in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It can deal with anything that happens and control any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, no enemy can shake Solomon from his repose in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The valiant men represent Solomon's power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has the power to deal with all of his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He still has his bed, which means that he is more than a conqueror.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The question concerns the maiden, whereas the answer concerns Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates the oneness between the maiden and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever is Solomon's is hers; this is union.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The union between the maiden and the victory of Christ speaks of our enjoyment of Christ's victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, there are many angels today who are ready to fight for the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The victory has been won already; they are just maintaining this victory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is King already; they are just upholding His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 9 and 10 say, "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the second part of the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word "behold" in verse 7 covers verses 9 and 10 also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word "chariot" is translated "palanquin" in Darby's New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bed is used by Solomon in the night, whereas the palanquin is used by him in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the bed speaks of his rest, the palanquin must speak of his move.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the bed denotes his dwelling, the palanquin must denote his fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the bed is toward the enemy, the palanquin must be toward the friend.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We see a palanquin, not a chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If it were a chariot, there would be the need for a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But a palanquin is carried by men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should recall the history of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ark was not to be drawn by oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, it had to be carried by the sons of Kohath.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that in His move among God's children, Christ is carried by those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The palanquin is made of the wood of Lebanon, which is cedar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wood denotes humanity, whereas the wood of Lebanon denotes uplifted and noble humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"He made the pillars thereof of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This speaks of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the objective sense, it means that Christ is carried to others by means of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the subjective sense, it means that the work of the cross has to remove all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only then can we express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"The bottom thereof of gold."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This speaks of the fact that everything is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The divine life is the life we received at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We come into full participation of this life when we become absolutely one with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's life is the unique basis upon which we can express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Outside of God's life, we have no other ground to stand on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"The covering of it of purple."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is purple because He is King, and He must reign.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the government is upon His shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will receive the kingship and sit as King.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"The midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Love is under the feet; it is at the bottom of the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that all the saints love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The question that was posed asked, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness?", and the answer was, "King Solomon made himself a palanquin."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This speaks of the union between the believers and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The answer first covers Solomon's position before his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now it covers his position before his friend.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the first case, it speaks of Solomon's power; in this case, it speaks of Solomon's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the first part, we see Solomon's strength being the maiden's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this part, we see Solomon's glory being the maiden's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The palanquin, the pillars, the bottom of the palanquin, the covering, and the love belong to Solomon and to her.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, Solomon, who is in the midst of all these things, is also hers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These things do not just belong to her; they are the maiden herself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a grand union.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These two sentences show us the complete union between the maiden and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why the question concerns the maiden, but the answer concerns the King.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Verse 11 says, "Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By 3:11 we have a proper relationship of love.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Prior to this, the King and the maiden were only friends, but now there is an espousal between them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The "daughters of Zion" may denote the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They can identify themselves with others' experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The crown here is not a crown of glory, nor a crown in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This crown does not denote authority kingship .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is a crown given by his mother, in addition to the other crowns he has.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This crown is given to him for his marriage and is for the joy of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There are two kinds of crowns in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One denotes glory and authority, and the other denotes joy 1 Thes 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The crown of Solomon belongs to the second kind.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is a crown of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, the crown denotes the person he will marry.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The King will gain the maiden in a way that is comparable to gaining a crown; it will give joy to his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>From this point on, he considers the maiden as a most precious crown, as if she is his boast and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There are different explanations for the word "mother"; none of them is satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All of the explanations have their basis, but none of them can be linked to a spiritual line.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In comparing these explanations, my personal view tends to consider the word "mother" as referring to humanity in general.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The father of the Lord Jesus is God, and His fleshly mother is human.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This seems to indicate that the Lord Jesus has now secured one from among the human race who can satisfy His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>From this point on, there is a marriage relationship between the maiden and the King.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The marriage love and joy come only after there is a complete union.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Bible shows that the enjoyment of our marriage with the Lord is a result of the experience of our union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is the end of the speaking by the third party.</S>
