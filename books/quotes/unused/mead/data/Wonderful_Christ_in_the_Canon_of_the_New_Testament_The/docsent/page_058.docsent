   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE ONE NEW MAN AS THE BODY-CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 2:15-16; 4:4-6, 13-16, 22-24; 1 Cor 12:12-13; 1:9-10; Rom 15:5-6 ONE MIND AND ONE MOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How wonderful to take Christ as our person!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we are all taking Him as our person, the real oneness is brought in. Romans 15:6 says, That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand people have one mind and one mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here is a verse which tells us that the church has one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could all the Californians, the Texans, the Yankees, the Filipinos, the Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Germans, and the British all have one mind and one mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only way is if we all take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of us must put aside our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the other persons must be buried!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will all have only one person, and that is Christ who is our unique person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus we will all become one man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ONE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the last century, the matter of the Body of Christ has been stressed so much by the seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everywhere you can hear the seeking ones talking about the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But most Christians have never seen that the Body of Christ is not only a Body, but also a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because they have not seen this, some of the translators translated the Bible in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Revised Standard Version in Ephesians 4:22-24 translates the Greek word for man into nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The new man in Ephesians 4:24 is not the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This can be clearly seen in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to create in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see that the new man is not an individual matter; it is a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, Paul says that Christ abolished all the ordinances to create a new man of two peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And we know that these two peoples are the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in the following verse, he says that Christ reconciled both of these two peoples unto God in one Body by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By reading these two verses it is clear that the one new man is the one Body and the one Body is the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this we can see that the church is not only a Body, but also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This point has not been seen by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In recent years the Lord has shown us that the church is not only a Body, but a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the difference between a body and a man?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A body needs life, but a man needs not only life but also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A tree needs life, but a tree does not need a person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life in a tree grows, but that life is not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man not only has a life to live, but also a person to express.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To grow is a matter of life, but to express oneself is a matter of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church as the Body of Christ needs life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is not an organization; it is a living organism, and this is something pertaining to life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet the church is not only the Body, but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the new man, the church not only needs life, but also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>ONE MIND AND ONE MOUTH FOR ONE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To have one mind and one mouth is not related so much to the life as to the person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why are there so many opinions among Christians today?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is because nearly all the Christians do not know that they should take Christ as their person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regardless of how many Christians come together, the person should only be one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So the whole church as the one new man has only one mind and one mouth of the one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the Body of Christ and as the one new man the church not only needs the life, but also the person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are here not only for the Body, but also for the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And this new man has a unique person that is neither you nor me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our person is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we can understand how thousands of people could have one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The philosophers would say that this is impossible, but we do know that this is a fact for we have experienced this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because all the believers as the members of the Body of Christ must take Christ as their person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we all take this one Person, He thinks for us and He speaks for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have one mind to think and one mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 1 Corinthians 1:10, Paul says, Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>. How could we be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The only way is to forget about our person and take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we all take Christ as our person, spontaneously we will all be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus we will be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus Rom 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not according to the Scripture, doctrine, knowledge, or anything else; we can only be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it is according to doctrine, immediately we will be of a different mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are so many doctrines to argue about.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Should baptism be by sprinkling or immersion?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Is the rapture pre-tribulation, post-tribulation, or mid-tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is man a dichotomy or a trichotomy?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What about speaking in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Doctrinally speaking, we could never stop arguing.</S>
