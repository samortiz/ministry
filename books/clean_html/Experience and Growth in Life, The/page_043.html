<h1 class=series>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10-11; 6:4-5; 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 13</h1><h2 class=head1>RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF GOD’S SON, SAVED IN HIS LIFE, AND BOASTING IN GOD</h2><p>Romans 5:10-11 says, “For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life. And not only so, but we also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.” Verse 10 speaks of the death of Christ and the life of Christ. We were reconciled to God through the death of Christ, and now we are being saved in the life of Christ.<p>According to verse 11, we also are boasting in God. Boast has the meaning of exult and glory. We are boasting, exulting, and glorying in God because we are being saved in His life. To exult is to be crazily happy. While we are being saved in the life of Christ, we should not be too quiet. Every day we have to boast, exult, and glory. This should be the expression of our salvation in the life of Christ.<p>We were reconciled to God through the death of Christ, and we are now being saved in His life. This salvation is not our eternal salvation but our daily, moment by moment salvation. If the trials that we undergo seem to last a long time, this may indicate that we are not enjoying our moment by moment salvation. If we are experiencing this salvation, we will boast and exult, and the trials will pass by quickly. By the Lord’s sovereignty, we are often placed in trying situations. The way to enjoy this salvation in these situations is to boast, exult, and glory in God.<p>Paul’s writing in Romans 5:10-11 was very careful. Moreover, he did not compose these verses merely according to doctrine but according to his experience. He did not say that we boast, exult, and glory in our salvation, but in the person of God. We are enjoying our salvation in God. This indicates that we have a direct contact, union, and connection with God. Our enjoyment in God may be compared to the enjoyment of a child with his mother. Little children care mainly for their mother’s presence. The younger a child is, the closer he stays to his mother. You can take away many things from a baby without disturbing him, but you cannot take away the presence of his mother. In the same way, we enjoy the salvation of Christ in the person of God.<p>Paul’s wording in these verses is wonderful, especially in his use of prepositions. It is through the death of God’s Son that we are reconciled to God, but it is in His life that we are saved daily. This means that if we are not in God experientially, we cannot be saved in the life of Christ. We must have a direct, instant union with God. To be saved minute by minute, we must be in God, in the direct, constant, and instant union with God. Furthermore, we are now boasting, exulting, and glorying, not in the death of Christ or even in His life but in the person of the Triune God. We are one with Him, minute by minute.
