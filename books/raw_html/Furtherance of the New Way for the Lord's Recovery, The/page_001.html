It contains seven chapters, beginning with a definition of the Lordâ€™s recovery and its new way and continuing with a discussion of the commission and definite steps for the carrying out of the new way and the key to its success. This is truly an indispensable guide for the advancement, increase, and spread of the churches. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p></td></tr></table></div>
