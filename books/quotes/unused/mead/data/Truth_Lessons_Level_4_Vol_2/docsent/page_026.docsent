   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Concerning Dan</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Deuteronomy 33:22 Moses prophesied, Dan is a lion s whelp / That leaps forth from Bashan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a young lion, Dan was not fighting for the prey but for more land Josh 19:47; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>18:27-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In typology, to fight for more land is to fight for more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The young lion in Judah was for seizing the prey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the young lion in Deuteronomy 33:22 is fighting for more land, that is, fighting to gain more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Judges 18 Dan is a young lion fighting for more land.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. Concerning Naphtali</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In blessing Naphtali, Moses spoke of this tribe as being satisfied with favor and filled with the blessing of the Lord Deut 33:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Naphtali would possess the sea the west and the south.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sea, the west, signifies the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The south, the land, signifies the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that Naphtali would possess the whole earth, that is, the Gentile and Jewish world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Matthew 4:13-16, the Lord Jesus in fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 9:1-2 came to the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali, beside the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, through the preaching of the gospel, those of Naphtali possessed the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Church history shows that much has been gained for the Lord in the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>J. Concerning Asher</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Moses prophecy, Asher would be blessed above the sons; he would be the one favored of his brothers Deut 33:24 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Dipping His Foot in Oil</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 24 also says that Asher would be the one dipping his foot in oil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Undoubtedly, the oil here is olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is an abundance of olive trees in this part of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, it is rich in oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fact that Asher would dip his foot in oil indicates that, as far as food is concerned, he would be richer than all the other tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His Doorbolts Being Iron and Copper</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 25 says, Your doorbolts shall be iron and copper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Iron and copper are for fighting the battle and for building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oil is food for nourishment, but iron and copper are materials for fighting and for building up the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since Asher would be rich, favored in food and minerals, he would be more blessed than the other tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He would have food for nourishment and minerals for weapons and building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As His Days Are, So Would His Strength Be</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second part of verse 25 says, As your days are, so shall your strength be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Strength in this verse relates to safety, security, rest, peace, and quietness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It denotes a leisurely life, a life in which there is sufficiency with no need to worry or rush.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, Asher was to have a leisurely life, a life that was safe and secure and in which sufficiency was guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that throughout his life he would not lack anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He would have rich food for nourishment, weapons for defense, and materials for building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of scarcity, there would be sufficiency, rest, peace, and leisure.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After Moses blessed each individual tribe, he blessed all the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses said that there is no one like the God of Jeshurun Israel , who rides through the heavens as their help and in His majesty through the skies v. 26 .

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, God would drive out the enemy before them v. 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of the foregoing blessings, Israel would dwell securely, the fountain of Jacob in solitude, on a land of grain and new wine, with the heavens over him dropping their dew v. 28 . Finally, Moses proclaimed, Happy are you, O Israel; who is like you? / A people saved by Jehovah, / The shield of your help / And He who is the sword of your majesty! / So your enemies shall come cringing to you, / And you shall tread upon their high places v. 29 . This was a final blessing on all the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>History has proved that Israel is blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although they have often rebelled against God and have even rejected the Lord, God still preserves them and will care for them until the consummation of this age when the whole house of Israel will be saved Rom 11:25-27; Isa 59:20-21; 27:9 .</S>
