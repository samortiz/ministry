   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CAUSING MAN TO BE REGENERATED PEARL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does the pearl signify?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although pearl is replaced with silver in 1 Corinthians because of the need for redemption, pearl was God's original concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, I did not know what the Bible meant by pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, after passing through many experiences with the Lord, we now understand the meaning of pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider how a pearl is formed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An oyster living in the sea is wounded by a piece of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The oyster secretes life juice around the grain of sand until the sand becomes a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the oyster who lived in the ocean of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are the grains of sand that wound Him and, after injuring Him, stay at His wound.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His life secretes His life essence, enveloping us with it layer upon layer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, after becoming fully enclosed by this life-secretion, we become a pearl Matt 13:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the experience of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Originally, we were small pieces of sand, but we became pearls as the life juice of Christ enveloped our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every gate of the New Jerusalem is a pearl, signifying the entrance into the kingdom of God Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said that unless we are born anew we cannot enter into the kingdom of God John 3:5; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have been born again and can enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, by becoming pearls, we even become the entrance itself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After entering the New Jerusalem through the gate of pearl, we find ourselves on the street of gold Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that we walk according to the divine nature and that the divine nature becomes our way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regeneration is our gate; the divine nature is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not go to others to ask them what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus is your way John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You simply need to walk according to the golden street, the divine nature within you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, do you get your haircut according to the divine nature?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sisters, do you shop according to the divine nature?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am quite sure that the golden way never leads to a movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you are going in the direction of the movies, you will find yourself on the way of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to walk the golden way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be on the street of gold is to touch the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CAUSING MAN TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST PRECIOUS STONE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we may have the gate of pearl and the street of gold, we do not yet have a wall built up to express the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The wall of the New Jerusalem is not only an erected boundary that separates the holy from the common, but also a building that expresses the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Revelation 4:2-3, God sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wall of the New Jerusalem and the first foundation stone of the wall are also built with jasper Rev 21:18-19 , bearing the same appearance as God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we have passed through the gate of pearl and are walking the golden way, I still expect to see around us a wall built up to include all godly things, to exclude all worldly things, and to express the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This wall is built up by the way of transformation 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2a; 1 Cor 3:12a .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The materials of the wall are all transformed precious stones Rev 21:11, 18a, 19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only transformed people can be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where do precious stones come from?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A precious stone is a transformed item.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All precious stones originally were of other materials.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some of them were formed into igneous rocks by pressure and heat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others were formed into sedimentary rocks by pressure and by the flowing of water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All became precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Diamond Exo 28:18 is formed out of carbon by heat and pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Under extreme pressure and intense heat the carbon becomes a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are the principles of the transformation of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Oh, we need the burning, we need the flowing of the living water, and we need the pressure!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After entering the gate of pearl and walking the street of gold, you may think you are right with the Lord in every respect.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As far as the gate and the street are concerned, you are right with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As you walk the golden way, you may have no problem with the Lord, but other difficulties will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, as a young brother you may expect to have a very good sister as your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Also, the sisters expect to have a fine young brother as their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, married people can testify that while marriage is an enjoyment, it also causes suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Each husband is a source of suffering to the wife, and each wife is a source of suffering to the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although you may provide enjoyment for your spouse, you also provide some suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We try our best to make our spouses happy, yet we cannot avoid making them suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although marriage is a cause of suffering, we cannot do without marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our marriage is not in our own hands; it is overruled by the sovereign Lord Himself according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Besides the suffering caused by marriage, there are many other sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Along the golden way are many pains and piercing thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In your kitchen you have many appliances.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among them is a stove with an oven.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is difficult to cook properly without a stove and oven.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In one sense, the church is a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In another sense, the church is a dining room and a kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Without the kitchen, the dining room is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church kitchen has a big stove with many compartments.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is a place in that stove for every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I can testify from my own experience that in the church we are truly burned for the sake of our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The leading brothers burn one another constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The husbands burn the wives, and the wives burn the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is God's burning for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We were made earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although these vessels are useful, their material, which is clay, does not match the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the New Jerusalem there are no bricks, only transformed stones.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need a great amount of pressure and burning and flowing of life before we can be transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more pressure, burning, and flowing we experience, the more precious we become.</S>
