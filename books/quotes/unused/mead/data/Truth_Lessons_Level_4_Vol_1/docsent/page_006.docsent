   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, Christ the Son is the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the child and the Mighty God are one person, so the Son and the Eternal Father are also one person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The baby born in the manger in Bethlehem was the gift given by God to us, and this gift is His Son, who is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CONCERNING THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Old Testament contains prophecies not only concerning the divinity of Christ but also concerning the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ s humanity mainly speak of His humanity in relation to four persons: the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and the branch of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Being the Seed of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first prophecy in the Old Testament, which is also the first prophecy in the entire Bible, speaks of Christ as the seed of the woman in His humanity.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being God with Us</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ in His humanity was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin; hence, man called His name Emmanuel God with us Isa 7:14; Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The el in Emmanuel means God in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that He is God; He is the incarnated God living among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, He is not only God but also God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ in His humanity as the very Emmanuel not only was with the disciples when He was on earth 14:9 but also is with us, since His ascension, whenever we are gathered into His name.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Bruising the Head of the Ancient Serpent, Satan</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genesis 3:15 prophesies that Christ as the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the old serpent, Satan, and the serpent would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fulfillment of the first half of this prophecy is referred to in Hebrews 2:14 and in 1 John 3:8, which reveal that through death Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This prophecy will be further fulfilled when the ancient serpent is cast down out of heaven by the man-child Rev 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The last half of the prophecy the serpent bruising the heel of the seed of the woman was fulfilled when Christ s feet were nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By having the Lord Jesus feet nailed to the cross, Satan bruised His heel Psa 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan tempted the man, whom God created for Himself, to sin and rebel against God.</S>

Thus, through the death on the cross, Christ judged Satan, the enemy of God John 12:31; 16:11 , destroyed the works of the devil 1 John 3:8b , and destroyed the devil, who dwells in fallen man Heb 2:14 , so as to free man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, the overcoming believers will execute God s judgment on the ancient serpent, Satan, and cast him down to the earth Rev 12:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before the millennium begins, Christ will send an angel to bind Satan and cast him into the abyss where he will be shut up for one thousand years 20:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the end of the millennium, Satan will be released from the abyss.</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The devil, who deceived them, will be cast into the lake of fire, where he will be tormented day and night forever and ever v. 10 . This is the last step of the executing of Christ s judgment on Satan, and it is also the final purging of the poison of rebellion against God that was injected into man by Satan.</S>
