THE THINGS THAT MUST TAKE PLACE<br>(REVELATION 4:1)</H2><P>"After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things." </P><P>Based upon the words "the things that must take place after these things" in 4:1, some say that the things in chapters four and five have not yet been fulfilled because they concern those things which will happen at the time that the church is about to be raptured, at the Lord's return. This is a very common interpretation; however, with this explanation there are clearly the following eight problems:</P><P>(1) If we say that chapters four and five refer to the things that will take place later, why is such an important matter as the rapture of the church not mentioned at all? Since the rapture is mentioned in chapters seven, twelve, fourteen, and fifteen of this book, why is it not mentioned at all in this portion? Some say that the words "Come up here" in 4:1 refer to the rapture of the church, yet verse 2 says, "Immediately I was in spirit." The church will be raptured physically, but here verse 2 speaks of being in spirit. Therefore, we can say that this does not refer to the rapture of the church. How could it be possible, when chapters two and three mention the events of the church, that there is not one clear word concerning the rapture of the church immediately thereafter?</P><P>(2) If Revelation 4:1 speaks of the rapture of the church, then where is the church in chapters four and five? Some say that the twenty-four elders in 4:4, 10, and 5:8 represent the church. Later on we shall prove that the twenty-four elders are not the representatives of the church. For now we need only to ask why it is that not even one of the twenty-four elders is mentioned from Revelation -22. Is it because the church is limited to the tribulation and to the enjoyment of the kingdom, but is no longer seen or heard in the new heaven and new earth? Can it be that she was there in the beginning but disappears later on?</P><P>(3) Chapter five shows how the Lamb receives glory in the heavens. Is it possible to say that the Lord must wait for two thousand years before He will receive glory?</P><P>(4) The praises of those "in heaven and on the earth and under the earth" (5:13) correspond with what is said in Philippians 2:10. This is such a glorious scene because the Lord has resurrected, ascended to the heavens, and received from the Father "the name which is above every name" (Phil. 2:9). How can it be said, in contrast to this, that Revelation 5:13 describes something which occurs two thousand years later?</P><P>(5) Why should the new song in Revelation 5:9 wait two thousand years to be sung? Can it be that redemption is accomplished, yet the new song still cannot be sung?</P><P>(6) "As having just been slain" (5:6) clearly indicates that it describes the scene at the time of the Lord's ascension to the heavens. Although the Lord's death is eternally fresh, the words used here are quite clear-"having just been."</P><P>(7) In Revelation 4:8, the four living creatures say, "Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming." Compare this with Revelation 11:17: "Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was." Here the phrase "and who is coming" is left out. From this we can see that the Lord's coming must be after 4:8; it could never be before 4:8.</P><P>(8) Revelation 5:6 says that the seven Spirits of God are "sent forth into all the earth." What will the Holy Spirit do in all the earth during the great tribulation? We know that the Holy Spirit descended only after the Lord Jesus' ascension. It is in the age of the church that the Spirit is sent forth by the Lord.</P><P>According to these eight points, we realize that chapter four unveils the normal situation before God; it is the original situation in the heavens. Chapter five speaks of the situation at the time of the Lord's ascension (because not until 5:6 do we see the Lamb standing), which is displayed purposely for John. The "door opened in heaven" "after these things" in 4:1 does not happen after the time of the seven churches, but after the seeing of the vision in chapter one.</P><P>"Behold, a door opened in heaven." The heavens were opened to Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:1), to the Lord (Matt. 3:16), to Stephen (Acts 7:56), to Peter (Acts 10:11), and to John (Rev. 4:1; 19:11).</P><P>"And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me." Here it says "like a trumpet," but not actually a trumpet. The phrase "Come up here" was spoken to John individually; it is not a type of the rapture of the church. (Scofield said that this is a type of the rapture of the church, but it is impossible to assert this here.) "I will show you" speaks of the words that are heard. "I will show you the things that must take place after these things" is an introduction to the following words of prophecy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
