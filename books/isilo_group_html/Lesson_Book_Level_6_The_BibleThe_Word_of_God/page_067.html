<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The events recorded in this book took place between 1491 B.C. and 1451 B.C. (Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Deuteronomy is the preparation of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to take the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>[The book of Deuteronomy is filled with the speaking of Moses to the second generation, the generation which was ready to enter into the good land and possess it. Concerned that they would repeat the failures of their fathers, Moses charged them concerning many matters, repeating certain things again and again. He especially spoke repeatedly concerning those matters which would preserve the people and qualify them to enter into the good land and to possess, inherit, and enjoy the land. Moses was like an elderly father speaking out of concern for his children.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of Deuteronomy is that Christ is the Instructor and Leader of the people of God that they may be able to enter into the heavenly territory and participate in His riches.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The general sketch of Deuteronomy is this: the renewed training was given to the new generation of the children of Israel after their long journey in the wilderness, to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God that they may inherit it as their possession.</p>
