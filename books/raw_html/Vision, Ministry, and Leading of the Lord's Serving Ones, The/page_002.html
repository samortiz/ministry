        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">VISION AND REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 26:19; Gal. 1:11-12, 16; 2 Tim. 2:21; 3:14-15; Jer. 15:19; Job 42:3-5; Matt. 5:8; 2 Cor. 3:15-18</h1>
<p>A person who serves and works for the Lord must be called, and he must have a vision and revelation. Seeing a vision and receiving revelation are necessary matters for all the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION AND REVELATION OF PAUL</h2>
<p>Paul is a pattern of a worker for the Lord in the New Testament, and he often spoke of his service. In Acts 26:19 he said, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; This shows that his service and work came from a vision.</p>
<p>In order to serve God, one must have a vision from God. If a household servant works as he pleases and does not listen to the owner of the house, he will not be useful, and it would not be wise to hire such a person. A good servant asks what he needs to do because his work is not related to his own things. A servant should be willing to follow directions. This is a basic point in our service. It is a fearful thing when a brother brings only things that he sees as being good and proper into the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>All the education, teaching, and instruction that Paul received from his youth came from the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. When he was serving God and persecuting Christians as Saul of Tarsus, his mind and even his whole being were constituted with these items. For Saul, the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law were not merely the content of his education; they were his very being. In his person he represented the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. Without receiving a heavenly vision, it would not have been possible for Paul to bring anything but the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law into his service to God, because these things constituted his very being.</p>
<p>Consequently, when the Lord called Saul, He flashed a light around him that caused him to fall on the ground (9:3-4). When Saul fell to the ground, the elements of the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law also fell. As soon as the light of God&rsquo;s New Testament flashed around him, he could not stand; he fell completely. His entire being and all that was constituted into his being also fell. The Old Testament fell, Judaism fell, and the law fell. Everything within him fell.</p>
<p>After Saul fell, he asked two questions. First, he asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; (v. 5; 22:8). Saul was not an atheist. He believed in God; we may even say that he believed in God very much. His belief in God was the source of his zeal for persecuting the believers. Although he was very zealous for the God of his forefathers, he did not truly know God. This shows that it is possible to have much biblical knowledge but not know God. Even if Saul could have recited the entire Old Testament, he did not know God. He was zealous for God, and he knew the Scriptures, but he did not know God. In fact, he was even opposing God. Apparently, he was serving God; actually, he was opposing God. The Lord told him that he was kicking against the goads, like an ox that does not submit to its master&rsquo;s yoke (26:14). Saul&rsquo;s knowledge of God was so limited that when the light flashed around him and he fell, he did not know who was speaking to him from the heavens. He asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord replied, &ldquo;I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute&rdquo; (22:8). Saul thought he was persecuting Christians, but the Lord said that he was persecuting Him, because the Lord was living in the Christians whom Saul was persecuting, such as Peter, James, and Stephen. Saul thought that he was persecuting Christians, but the Lord told him that he was persecuting the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>With this realization, Saul immediately asked a second question: &ldquo;What shall I do, Lord?&rdquo; (v. 10). The first question relates to knowing the Lord; the second relates to receiving the Lord&rsquo;s vision. The Lord said, &ldquo;Rise up and go into Damascus, and there it will be told to you concerning all the things which have been appointed to you to do&rdquo; (v. 10). From this point forward he began to have a vision. This vision cut him off from his previous service and brought him into the New Testament service. The Old Testament, Judaism, and the law, that is, his religious knowledge from his past, was terminated. This cutting off was signified by the outward blinding of his eyes. From that day forward his outward consideration of the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law was &ldquo;blinded,&rdquo; and the one who led others to oppose Christians now needed someone to lead him to Damascus. His outer religious &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; became blind, but his inner &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; were enlightened through revelation.</p>
<p>Whether we are newly saved or have been saved for many years, and whether we are an elder, a deacon, or a co-worker, our service will be according to God&rsquo;s standard only if our being has &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; to the ground and our &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; have been blinded. Without the blinding of our &ldquo;eyes,&rdquo; our past will not be terminated, and our inner &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; will not be enlightened to see the vision of God and receive the revelation of God.</p>
<p>This is the problem among Christians today. Many Christians are like Saul of Tarsus before the light flashed around him: their outer eyes are open, but their inner &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; are blind. There is much chaos in Christianity today, because many people have never been blinded and have never fallen to the ground. They bring religious things, like the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law, into their service. Hence, they cannot receive God&rsquo;s vision and revelation, and their service is related only to religious things, not to a heavenly vision.</p>
<p>Paul testified to King Agrippa that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision from the day that he met the Lord on his way to Damascus (26:19). Paul&rsquo;s way of serving God came from a heavenly vision. When he saw this vision, the things of the Old Testament came to an end, and he began to take the New Testament way. This can be seen in relation to the practice of circumcision, which will never be forsaken by the Jews. After receiving a heavenly vision, Paul did not insist on this practice (Gal. 5:2-4, 6, 11). When he said to King Agrippa, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&rdquo; the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law no longer governed him. When he abandoned Judaism, he offended the Jews, and the Jews denounced him. However, Paul did not abandon Judaism according to his own will but because he saw a vision. He was bound with chains and made a prisoner because he was obedient to the heavenly vision (Acts 21:33; 26:29). In order to maintain the new, he had to abandon the old. In order to run the new way, he had to turn away from the old way.</p>
<p>In Galatians 1:15-16 Paul says, &ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles.&rdquo; Paul received more than an outward vision concerning a way; he received an inward revelation concerning life. When he said, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&rdquo; he was speaking of the way of his service, and when he spoke of God revealing His Son in him, he was speaking of inward life. He came to know Christ as life in his service to God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
