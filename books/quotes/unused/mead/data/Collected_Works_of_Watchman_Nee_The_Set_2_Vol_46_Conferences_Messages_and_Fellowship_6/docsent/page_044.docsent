   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BEARING OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth aspect of Christ's death is allowing the cross to be the ruling principle of our life, daily allowing it to undercut our natural life and power Matt 10:34-39; Mark 8:32-35; Luke 17:32-34; John 12:24-26; 2 Cor 4:10-11; Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this way the natural life and power will not act according to itself or assert itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to touch the very core of our problem, we must deal with the question of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way the dying or killing of the Lord Jesus will release and manifest His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord has taken great care to show us that we can live only by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Trials and difficulties are brought in to prove this point to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The real meaning of the Christian life is nothing less than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does it mean to live under law?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It means that God demands something from us and we try to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does it mean to live under grace?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that God still demands something, but Christ does it in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This life is not an end in itself, but a means to fully secure God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to distinguish between the "old man," the sin producer, and the soul, that is the natural power and ability to act according to one's self independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Self is not necessarily sinful, but it always stands apart from the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are times when the self is quite righteous, almost holy!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our sins and our "old man" have been dealt with, we are back to where Adam was before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our problem then becomes Adam's original problem the problem of the soul acting independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus Christ was a sinless man, but He had a separate personality from God: "I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" John 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The real significance of the Lord's temptation was Satan's efforts to make Him act according to Himself and thus relinquish His complete dependence upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When man acts according to himself, that is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"The Son can do nothing from Himself" John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that nothing originated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The matter of the soul is not related to sins as such; it is related to independence something we do without the help of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The danger for us is that we can live by our own power: "I can plan, and I can decide."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God shows us another aspect of the cross which deals with the soul through the bearing of the cross daily.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to distinguish between the two sides of the cross: 1 the crucifixion of the cross which dealt with the flesh, and 2 the bearing of the cross, which deals with the self in a daily process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This second aspect of the cross deals with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cross is brought to bear on the soul so that the mold of death, the mark of the cross, is constantly conforming the soul into subjection to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 10:37-39 indicates that the soul is the seat of our affections.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many actions and decisions are influenced by our affections.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a consequence, the Lord said, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me," and "He who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to lose our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we cannot fulfill its wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to ignore what the soul is asking for.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some secret love may cause us to deviate from our course of fully following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Mark 8:32-35 Peter said to the Lord, in effect, "Have mercy upon Yourself!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's reply was a strong rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The soul's desire is self-preservation; but in order to go on with God, we have to go against ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are we afraid of the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do we like the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Miss Barber once said, "Lord, I am willing to break my heart so that I can have Your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When there is no mixture of soul and spirit, and everything is out from the Spirit, then God's will is all, and we will shed no tears in sympathy for our soul-life!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The soul-life is occupied by the things of the earth Luke 17:32-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What will be our reaction to the claims of our home, the interests of our service, etc.?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are living according to the soul-life, our reaction will not be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fruitfulness comes from the loss of our soul John 12:24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What part of us must be lost before there can be "much fruit"?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The soul!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is so little expression of the life within us because the power of the soul is wrapping and enveloping it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are living, doing, and acting out from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The cross must come in before the soul-life can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 25 is in connection with the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In times of temptation, the self wants to resist, but any victory won on this basis is a counterfeit victory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only what the Lord does in us is real deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our attitude should be: "Lord, I cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, I will not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, You do it."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This dredging up of the natural life begins with a definite crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some souls are stronger than others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the Lord must come in to break all of them until no self-confidence is left.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as there is anything for us to confide in, we will have self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why God must dredge up all the ground of self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brokenness is only possible when we lose our self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Moses was once "powerful in his words and works" Acts 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet he had to be brought to the place where he confessed, "I am not eloquent" Exo 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those whose soul-lives have been dealt with by the cross are marked by a spirit of fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They are certain of nothing but the Lord, and they walk very softly with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot know Him and the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 unless we are willing to allow the stamp of death the cross to be sealed to our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must be brought to the place where we have no confidence in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a life process, a daily taking up of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All self-trust must go.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Any teaching on holiness or victory is inconsequential unless the self, the soul-energy, is first dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord is after utter dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He does not want anyone to act independently of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is not asking us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God is the only Doer, the only Originator.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our part is simply to concur.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We can do nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must know His death in its fullness in all four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the cross we see God's true estimate of us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are only fit for death; therefore, we should not even try to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is not passivity; it is active faith.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We refuse to live out from our self.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We choose to live in complete dependence upon God, and we will allow the cross to do an ever deeper dredging work in us so that we will be "conformed to His death."</S>
