   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Satan always works to attack God's children.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One of Satan's strategies against the saints of the Most High is to wear them out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember that Satan's work among God's children is not apparent; he works by wearing them out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does it mean to wear someone out?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means to exhaust a person minute by minute, some today and some tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wearing out goes on invisibly, yet in a debilitating way; it goes on imperceptibly, yet the end is total depletion and waste.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan works in God's children by the principle of wearing them out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wears us out a little today and a little tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He causes us to suffer a little today and a little tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may think that this is insignificant, yet the result of this wearing out by Satan is total depletion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why the Bible says that the love of many will "grow" cold Matt 24:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The girl who was possessed by a spirit of Python cried out "for many days" Acts 16:17-18 .</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The "evil day" in Ephesians 6:13 refers to Satan's wearing out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must ask the Lord to open our eyes to see Satan's wearing-out work and how we can resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>WEARING OUT MAN'S BODY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan is particularly good at wearing out the physical bodies of God's children.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was Satan's wearing out of their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some Christians had healthy bodies before they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After they are saved they become sick, and their health deteriorates.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God opens our eyes, we will see that Satan is always plotting and planning to deal with God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of God's servants experience the same thing when they set out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before they set out to work and preach the gospel, they have no problems with their health, but once they start to work and preach, their health breaks down within a period of three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is Satan's wearing out of the saints of the Most High.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He makes them a little tired today and a little tired tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cumulative effect of this tiredness eventually destroys their health completely.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WEARING OUT MAN'S HEART</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan wears out not only man's body but also man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you first believed in the Lord, you may have been very happy, joyful, and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if you are not watchful and do not know the work of Satan, you will suddenly become restless one day, unhappy another day, and depressed a third day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Little by little your peace will be lost, and your joy will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will become weary and discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Satan's work in wearing you out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>WEARING OUT MAN'S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan also tries to wear out man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He takes away your prayer little by little; he takes away your trust in God little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He causes you to trust in yourself more and more and believe that you are cleverer and cleverer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He causes you to trust in your gift and distracts your heart from the Lord little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If Satan struck God's children with a powerful blow all at once, they could withstand him because they would realize that it was the work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But his most evil work is not to strike just one blow but to wear you out over a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He causes God's children to fall behind little by little and backslide little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way Satan wears out God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>WEARING OUT MAN'S TIME</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Satan also wears out man's time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, Festus sent for Paul to converse with him frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man as powerful and as gifted as Paul preached to Festus for two years, yet he was still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is Satan's wearing out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Festus would send for Paul, and there would be no result.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The next day he would send for Paul again, and there would be no result.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He continually sent for Paul, but there was no result.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Satan engaged Paul in work with no result.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the end of two years, there was still no result.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is Satan's wearing out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God's children do not know Satan's strategy, they will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should redeem the time, and each hour should be counted as an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must stop Satan from wearing out our time and engaging us in fruitless work.</S>
