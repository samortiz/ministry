   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION EIGHTEEN CONCERNING REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does redemption mean?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From what are we redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word redemption means to buy back, that is, a certain object that was once held as a pledge has now been bought back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have been redeemed, but from what were we redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many traditional teachings say that we were redeemed from the devil's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They say that because we were slaves under the devil's hand, the Lord Jesus shed His blood and redeemed us out of his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is the case, does this not mean that God acknowledged that it was lawful for us to be in the devil's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose someone that you know has stolen something from you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you pay him a price to ransom what has been stolen, you are acknowledging his theft to be lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood as a price to pay the devil to redeem us, we are, similarly, saying that God acknowledges the legality of man falling into the devil's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is certainly not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we cannot say that we are redeemed from the devil's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Should we say that we are redeemed from God's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No, this too is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 Saying that we are redeemed from God's hand effaces His love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus came because God sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible repeatedly tells us that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The entire New Testament mentions "the love of Christ" only three times in Romans 8:35, in 2 Corinthians 5:14, and in Ephesians 3:19.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus was willing to redeem us according to God's will because He also loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God loved us and prepared a way of salvation by sending His Son to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must not misjudge God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 If we are redeemed from God's hand, to whom do we belong?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we say that we are redeemed from God's hand, why do we still belong to God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Should we then say we are redeemed from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No, we cannot say this either.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are redeemed from sin, to whom is the ransom paid?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord truly paid the price, but sin cannot be the recipient of this price.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is only one place in the Bible that can answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 3:13 says, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our conclusion must be that we are redeemed from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were sinners before God under the curse of the law, but the Lord Jesus died for us and redeemed us from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were redeemed not from the law but from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being redeemed from the law would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Being redeemed from the curse of the law means being redeemed from the consequence of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whoever violates the law has to be punished; by the shedding of His blood, the Lord Jesus answered the demands of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He delivered us not just from a few laws; He delivered us from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the Bible says this, we can only say the same; saying more or less than this would be incorrect.</S>
