   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FRUSTRATION OF HUMAN OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the last case.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This case is not in the Judaistic fold; it is outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the Lord went out of Jerusalem, He went to a home in Bethany of one brother and two sisters who loved Him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before He came, something happened in this home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brother, Lazarus, became seriously ill, and the sisters sent a message to the Lord, which means that they prayed to Him 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is nothing wrong with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are in trouble, you must send a message to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At any time you can send a word to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may send Him the information about any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what He would do is up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter eleven serves a very specific purpose: it shows us that besides the opposition of religion, human opinions are the strongest frustration to life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Throughout the foregoing chapters, the problem that life faced was with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have seen, in every chapter life was opposed by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, there is no religion in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But there is another kind of frustration the frustration from human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is revealed in this chapter that frustrates the resurrection power of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This chapter vividly portrays how the human opinions frustrate the Lord s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once human opinions are subdued, resurrection life is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not a matter in religion, but in the church, at the home in Bethany, which is a miniature of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Jerusalem, you are in religion; in Bethany, you are in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Jerusalem you have religion; in the local church you have the problem of human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapters one through ten, Christ as life is fully revealed and, at the same time, religion is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now, in chapter eleven, Christ as the resurrection life is unfolded, but, at the same time, human opinions are brought to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although there is no problem of religion in the church, there is nevertheless another kind of hindrance, the hindrance of human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is the resurrection life, but He is hindered by the opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This chapter is filled with human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Martha and Mary considered that the Lord should have come immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was their opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord never acts on the basis of anyone s opinion; He always acts according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They thought that the Lord should come immediately, but the Lord purposely stayed away for two more days.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is the resurrection and the life and death is no problem to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is easy for Him to swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Death may be a problem to us, but it is not a problem to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He as resurrection can overcome death and swallow it up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, when we come to applying Him as resurrection, we face the problem of human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this message I want to impress you with this matter of our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The problem in the local church life which keeps us from seeing the resurrection of Christ is our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you read this chapter carefully, you will see that even the death of Lazarus was provided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His sovereignty, God prepared the environment which allowed Jesus follower to die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s sovereignty provided such a death situation in order to unfold Christ s resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without death there is no way to express resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Resurrection needs death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How could resurrection be manifested without it?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to praise the Lord for the death of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If Martha and Mary had seen that resurrection can never be manifested without death, they would have praised the Lord when they saw their brother dying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They would have known that this death would manifest the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In such a case, there would have been no human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may apply this to situations in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is always someone dying in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Someone or something is always dying.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever the responsible ones see such a death situation, they are troubled and say to the Lord, O Lord, isn t this Your church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Don t You love the church?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Don t You know that something in the church is dying?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a good prayer, but it is a prayer according to human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more you pray like this, the more the Lord will stay away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will delay His coming in order to exhaust the human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I first saw the light in this chapter, I was laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I had never seen how many opinions there were in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Surely the Lord knew that Lazarus was sick and He knew exactly how to handle the situation, even if they had not sent any news to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, they sent the news to Him, but He was not moved by it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes it is very difficult to move the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In a prayer meeting you may say, Lord, we move Your hand, but the more you try to move His hand, the more His hand refuses to be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord will never be moved according to your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When He heard the news, His heart was hard and unmoved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He remained where He was for another two days.</S>
