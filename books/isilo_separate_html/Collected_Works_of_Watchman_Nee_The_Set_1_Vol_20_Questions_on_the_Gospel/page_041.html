Was it between the time He was put on the cross and the time He expired, or was it at the very moment He expired?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>If we understand question thirty-two, we can conclude that we were crucified with Christ at the moment He expired. Prior to His expiration, He was engaged in the work of redemption, bearing our sins, and dying for us. If we were crucified with Him during that time, we would have been participating in His redemption and, thereby, we would have become saviors. Saying this would be a great mistake.</P><P>Some say that since the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours and did not die instantly, we must also have been crucified with Him for six hours. If this were the case, we would have also participated in the Lord's redemption. This is absolutely not so. We died with Christ at the moment He expired. The only One who suffered was the Lord Himself, but the effect is ours. We thank and praise God!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
