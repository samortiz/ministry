<h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>The emphasis of The Open Door is the gospel work in all the localities. In this publication we will print:</p><p>(1) Articles concerning the principles of the work</p><p>(2) News of the work</p><p>(3) News of the churches</p><p>We are temporarily publishing in Hankow. It is difficult to predict whether or not we will move. However, as long as Hankow does not have problems with the mail, our mailing address is still: Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. This publication is not for sale. We trust in God for the supply of its needs.</p><p>We only printed one thousand copies for the first issue. We cannot supply those who asked for earlier issues. We increased the print quantity to six thousand copies for the third issue. Whoever wants one can write and ask for it.</p><p>Whoever wants this publication must clearly write the name, address, and number of copies requested and send it to Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow. Whenever a subscriber's address changes, please notify us so that we do not send it to the wrong address.</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is being temporarily published in Hankow. Therefore, any news concerning the work and the churches in each locality, any subscriptions, and any questions should be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) The Gospel Book Room has established a separate office in Hankow. Any province, city, or county that wants to buy books from this book room can buy them directly from Hankow. Those who live in Hankow can come personally to buy them at Gospel Court, Lane 1, Hsiao-Dong-Jia, Hankow.</p><p>(3) The post office no longer accepts large packages of printed materials, so once this publication is printed, we will send one or two copies by the quickest method to each locality. Then we will send a large number of copies to the responsible brothers in each locality and ask them to pass them out to all the brothers and sisters in the meetings. Then we will send them out according to the subscription lists. Therefore, the brothers and sisters in each locality should clearly write their name, address, and the number of copies ordered if they want us to send an issue to them directly. If you do not send us your address, please borrow a copy from the responsible brother in your locality.</p><p>(4) We will do our best to distribute offerings to the brothers and sisters in need. However, some localities do not accept wired money any longer; nor do we know where some of the brothers and sisters have moved to. Therefore, we ask God to care for the brothers and sisters in tribulation in these difficult times on the one hand, and we hope that the brothers and sisters who have news would send the details to us by airmail or express mail on the other hand. If there are offerings or letters, please send both to Brother Lan Tsi-yi or Miss Ruth Lee, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p>
