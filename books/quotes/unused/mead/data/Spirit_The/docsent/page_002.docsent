   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: John 4:24; Gen 1:2; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 2:11; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>6:34; Isa 61:1; Luke 4:18; Acts 5:9; 8:39; 2 Cor 3:17; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18,20; Luke 4:1; Matt 3:16; Acts 10:38; Matt 12:28</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to enter into the significance of all the different aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need a vision of all these different aspects which will give us a clear view of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we see something, we will never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1958 I came to the United States, and someone took me to see Disneyland.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I could never forget Disneyland because I saw it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I received a vision of Disneyland, and what I saw was impressed into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, we need to see visions concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This series of messages is entitled The Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is the simplest divine title of the Spirit of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What I will share in these messages is the accumulation of all the visions which I have seen through my study of the Bible over many years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Basically speaking, what is revealed in the Bible is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to realize that the center of the Bible is God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is the source, Christ is the embodiment of the source, and this Christ is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is the reaching of God to us and the realization of the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the Spirit is the realization of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the very God who is the source of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first verse of the Bible, there is God In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth Gen 1:1 ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second verse of the Bible tells us that the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the first two verses of the Bible speak of God and of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first chapter of the Bible, there is not the term Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed One, but there are a number of things typifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapters one and two of Genesis, four items typify Christ: the light, the sun, the man Adam as the head over all things, and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the title Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed One, is not mentioned, the very person of Christ is typified as the light, as the sun, as the head of God s creation, and as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Triune God is in the first two chapters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In these first two chapters are God, the Spirit, and four types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we want to go on to see the different aspects of the Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SPIRIT THE ESSENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spirit is the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse does not say that God is the Spirit but that God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To insert a definite article, the, in this verse is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 4:24 does not show us the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It only says, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is just like saying that a table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We would not say that a table is the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we say that a table is wood, this indicates that the essence of the table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To say that a ring on a person s finger is gold means that the ring s essence is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 4:24 shows us what God s essence is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s essence is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to touch God and experience God, we need to know what His essence is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we need to see the distinction among four words: nature, substance, essence, and element.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the theological study of the Trinity, these four words have been used.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An element is a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every element has its nature, and in the nature of the element is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consequently, the essence denotes the very thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we can see that there is a difference in using the two words essence and substance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot refer to the substance of the essence but to the essence of the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Each substance or substantial element has its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is Spirit, and Spirit is the essence of God.</S>
