[2]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE CHRIST HIS WORK 1
[3]  As believers in Christ, we need a basic knowledge concerning Christ's person and work, which are the main constituents of the Christian faith.
[4]  If we have from the pure Word the proper knowledge of Christ's person and work, we shall not be misled.
[5]  Having covered Christ in His person, attributes, and virtues, we shall go on to consider Christ's work.
[6]  Through His work in incarnation Christ did something marvelous He brought God into man John 1:1, 14 .
[7]  If we study the Gospel of Luke thoroughly and deeply, we shall see that the incarnation of Christ was not only for the producing of the Savior.
[8]  Christ has accomplished the great work of making God one with man, of making the two God and man one person with two natures, divinity and humanity.
[9]  In this message we shall go on to see Christ's work in His human living.
[10]  Through His incarnation Christ became a man living on earth.
[11]  The time required for Christ to become a man was much longer than that required for Him to create the universe, and the time of His work in His human living was far greater than the time of His work in becoming a man, thirty years compared to nine months.
[12]  Mark 6:3 tells us that Christ was a carpenter in a lowly home.
[13]  In this message we shall begin to cover the many aspects of Christ's work in His earthly ministry.
[14]  Acts 10:38 says, "Jesus, the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him."
[15]  Christ, as God incarnated to be a man, did many miracles, as a beneficent work in His earthly ministry to release people from their sufferings of diseases and the possession of demons.
[16]  On certain occasions the Lord performed the great miracle of raising the dead.
[17]  While the Lord Jesus was at a wedding feast in Cana John 2:1-2 , the wine ran out v. 3 . A wedding feast signifies the pleasure and enjoyment of human life, and wine, the life juice of the grape, signifies life.
[18]  Because wine, unlike water, derives its source from grapes, it comes from something living.
[19]  Matthew 20:28a indicates that in His earthly ministry Christ served people: "The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve."
[20]  While Christ's diligence in labor, His need of food and rest Mark 3:20-21; 6:31 , His anger 3:5 , His groaning 7:34 , and His affection 10:21 display beautifully His humanity in its virtue and perfection, His lordship 2:28 , His omniscience 2:8 , His miraculous power, His authority to cast out demons 1:27; 3:15 , to forgive sins 2:7, 10 , and to silence the wind and the sea 4:39 manifest in full His deity, even as He served people.
[21]  After leading His sheep out of the fold, the Lord Jesus imparted eternal life into them.
[22]  Sending the Twelve Apostles and the Seventy Disciples to Preach the Kingdom
[23]  When He proclaimed the kingdom, He alone was carrying out the God-given ministry.
[24]  In this message we shall pay attention to a particular aspect of Christ's earthly ministry His teaching the truths concerning certain crucial matters.
[25]  In His gospel message in Luke 12:15-21 the Lord Jesus gives a warning concerning covetousness.
[26]  Someone in the crowd had asked Him to tell his brother to divide the inheritance with him v. 13 . To divide the inheritance is to pay attention to material things.
[27]  The Lord said, "Take heed and guard yourself from all covetousness; for no one's life is in the abundance of his possessions" v. 15 . Here the Lord indicates that we should pay attention not to material things but to life, to the soul, for one's life does not consist in material things.
[28]  In 18:9-14 we have Christ's teaching about our need to humble ourselves in order to enter into the kingdom of God.
[29]  In verses 10 through 13 the Lord tells of two men who went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
[30]  2 The Real David, the One Greater Than the Temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath
[31]  In Matthew 12:3-8 Christ continues His teaching concerning the New Testament economy.
[32]  When the Pharisees told Him that it was not lawful for His disciples to pick ears of grain on the Sabbath, He said, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?" vv.
[33]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of the truths taught by Christ in His earthly ministry. c.
[34]  The Kingdom 1 The Decree of the Kingdom's Constitution
[35]  The word spoken by Christ as the constitution of the kingdom Matt 5:1 7:29 is a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens.
[36]  In 5:48 the Lord concludes this section by saying, "You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."
[37]  For the kingdom people to be perfect as their Father is, is to be perfect in His love.
[38]  They are the Father's children, having the Father's divine life and nature.
[39]  In Matthew 13:1-52 we have the unveiling of the kingdom's mysteries.
[40]  The parable in Matthew 20:1-16, which is an explanation of the Lord's word to Peter in 19:28-30, concerns the kingdom reward.
[41]  Peter thought that he was able to pay the price of buying the kingdom, but the Lord indicated to him that the kingdom is priceless and cannot be purchased.
[42]  In Matthew 22:1-14 we have Christ's teaching concerning the kingdom's marriage feast.
[43]  "The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son" v. 2 . The king is God, and the son is Christ.
[44]  In Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus says, "If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church."
[45]  Whereas the church revealed in 16:18 is the universal church, the unique Body of Christ, the church revealed here is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.
[46]  In this message we shall complete our study of Christ's work in His earthly ministry.
[47]  The Lord Jesus cleansed the temple twice, at the beginning of His earthly ministry and at the end. John 2:14 through 16 says that He "found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.
[48]  In His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus never spoke His own word.
[49]  In not speaking from Himself the Lord did not seek His own glory but the glory of the One who sent Him v. 18 . Instead of speaking His own words, He spoke God.
[50]  Matthew 11:27 says, "No one knows the Son except the Father, neither does anyone know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."
[51]  Prophesying the Things to Come and His Coming Back
[52]  During His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus prophesied the things to come and His coming back Matt 24:3 25:36 .
[53]  In verse 3 of Matthew 24 the disciples asked Him, "When shall these things be, and what is the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?"
[54]  Establishing His Table for the Believers to Remember Him
[55]  At the end of His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus established His table for the believers to remember Him Matt 26:26-28 .
[56]  "As they were eating, Jesus took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body" v. 26 . The bread of the Lord's table is a symbol signifying the Lord's body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it.
[57]  In His death Christ gave Himself for the believers that He might redeem them and purify to Himself a people for His own possession as His peculiar treasure.
[58]  Giving His Physical Body for the Believers That They May Become Members of His Mystical Body
[59]  Luke 22:19 says, "Having taken a loaf, when He had given thanks, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you."
[60]  This loaf is a symbol signifying Christ's physical body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it.
[61]  Pouring Out His Blood for the New Covenant and for the Forgiveness of the Believers' Sins
[62]  As part of His work in His death Christ poured out His blood for the new covenant and for the forgiveness of the believers' sins.
[63]  Christ came to accomplish God's eternal redemption for God's chosen people by His death, according to God's will Heb 10:7, 9-10 , and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant Heb 8:6-13 , which became the new testament after His resurrection Heb 9:16-17 , as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace.
[64]  In His death the Lord Jesus worked to give His life a ransom for many.
[65]  "The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many" Matt 20:28 .
[66]  In His humanity the Lord served sinners even with His life, that is, with His soulish life.
[67]  First John 2:2 says that Christ is a propitiation concerning our sins, and 4:10 says that God sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins.
[68]  According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God.
[69]  The book of Hebrews reveals that Christ suffered the shame of death 2:9; 12:2; 13:12b .
[70]  When Christ tasted death on behalf of everything, He suffered and endured shame.
[71]  As the Last Adam Causing the Old Man to Be Crucified
[72]  In His death on the cross Christ was the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b causing the old man to be crucified Rom 6:6 .
[73]  Giving Himself for the Believers' Sins That He Might Rescue Them out of the Present Evil Age
[74]  Galatians 1:4 says that Christ "gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father."
[75]  Here we see that in His crucifixion Christ gave Himself for our sins.
[76]  As Our Peace Abolishing the Law of the Commandments in Ordinances Breaking Down the Middle Wall of Partition, the Enmity
[77]  Here we see that Christ died on the cross to abolish all the ordinances among mankind.
[78]  As a Grain of Wheat Falling into Death for the Release of the Divine Life
[79]  The Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died so that His divine element, His divine life, might be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 , just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to bear much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains.
[80]  Flowing Out the Water from His Body Signifying the Release of His Divine Life for the Producing of the Church
[81]  Finally, in His work on the cross the Lord Jesus flowed out water from His body, signifying the release of His divine life for the producing of the church.
[82]  In His resurrection Christ accomplished the work of rising from the dead to be the firstfruit of resurrection offered to God for His satisfaction.
[83]  In His work in His resurrection Christ caused His believers to be regenerated by God.
[84]  God "has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .
[85]  In His resurrection the Lord Jesus produced many grains for His multiplication and glorification.
[86]  Bringing Forth the Corporate Child the Corporate New Man Including Himself as God's Firstborn Son and His Many Brothers as God's Many Sons
[87]  In John 16:20 and 21 the Lord Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
[88]  Then we shall go on to consider His work in His ascension.
[89]  Breathing Himself as the Holy Spirit into the Disciples
[90]  Staying with the Disciples and Teaching Them the Things concerning the Kingdom of God
[91]  After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into the disciples, He stayed with them economically for forty days.
[92]  Acts 1:3 says, "To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, through a period of forty days, appearing to them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God."
[93]  Preparing and Charging the Disciples to Preach the Gospel and Disciple the Nations for His Propagation That the Church May Be Produced
[94]  Luke 24:44 and 45 say, "He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures." The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament, that is, all the Scriptures v. 27 . The Lord's word here unveils that the entire Old Testament was a revelation of Him and that He was its center and content.
[95]  Because the death of Christ is included in Christ, because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and because the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ.
[96]  In His work in His ascension Christ led captive those taken captive.
[97]  In this message we shall cover a number of aspects of Christ's work in His heavenly ministry.
[98]  The first thing Christ did in His heavenly ministry was to receive from God the Father the believers as gifts, after bringing them to the heavens, and giving them to the church.
[99]  Sending Forth the Holy Spirit, Promised by the Father, upon the Believers Economically for His Propagation to Produce the Church
[100]  In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said, "Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."
[101]  This is different from the Spirit of life, who was breathed into the believers John 20:22 by the resurrected Christ on the day of His resurrection for His indwelling so that He might be life to them essentially.
[102]  As Head over All Things to the Church, Making All Things Work Together for the Producing and Building Up of the Church
[103]  In His ascension, Christ was not only made the Lord of all and the Christ of God, but also given to be the Head over all things to the church, that all things may be subjected to and headed up in Him Eph 1:10 through the building up of the church which is His Body, the fullness of Him, the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 , for the eternal expression of the Triune God, the Father embodied in the Son, the Son realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Trinity expressed through all of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified saints.
[104]  As Mediator of the New Covenant, Executing That Covenant, Which Is the New Testament, Enacted and Bequeathed to Us by His Death
[105]  As Our Paraclete, Taking Care of Our Affairs on the Ground of His Propitiation for Our Sins
[106]  As our Paraclete 1 John 2:1 , Christ takes care of our affairs on the ground of His propitiation for our sins v. 2 . Often in our daily living we have failures and commit sins.
[107]  At such times we need Christ as our Paraclete, as our heavenly attorney, to take care of our case on the basis that on the cross He made propitiation for our sins and thus can propitiate our present situation with the righteous God.
[108]  We come now to another classification of Christ's work His work in the divine administration.
[109]  As the Lion-Lamb, the Overcoming Redeemer, Opening the Scroll of God's Economy
[110]  In the divine administration Christ, as the Lion-Lamb, the overcoming Redeemer, opens the scroll of God's economy Rev 5:3-7; 6:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12; 8:1 .
[111]  In His work in the divine administration Christ is also another Angel Rev 7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1 .
[112]  As another Angel Christ stands on the position of One who has been sent by God.
[113]  In the Old Testament Christ was called the Angel of the Lord, who was God Himself Gen 22:11-12; Exo 3:2-6; Judg.
[114]  Coming to Take Possession of the Sea and the Land
[115]  In Revelation 10:1 and 2 Christ comes as another Angel to take possession of the sea and the land.
[116]  Revelation 10:1 says, "I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire."
[117]  The rainbow indicates that Christ, in His judgment upon the earth, will keep the covenant God made with Noah Gen 9:8-17 .
[118]  In this message, the last on Christ's work, we shall cover Christ's work at His coming back, in the millennium, after the millennium, and in the New Jerusalem.
[119]  Catching Up the Majority of the Saints in Clouds Reaping the Harvest
[120]  After the firstfruit is reaped and the overcomers are taken up, during the tribulation Christ will descend with them to the air.
[121]  After Christ marries the overcomers, He will slay Antichrist.
[122]  "The lawless one shall be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearing of His coming " 2 Thes 2:8 .
[123]  In His work in the millennium Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign over all the nations Rev 20:4, 6; 2:27; 19:15c .
[124]  The millennium will be the last section of God's kingdom on this earth in the old creation over the God-created, fallen, and restored nations.
[125]  They all will be the last stage of human nations on the old earth, and they all will become the kingdom of God's Christ Rev 11:15 , and Christ and His overcomers shall be the kings over them.
[126]  Such a reigning will be the unique work of Christ in the millennium to show, for one thousand years, to the entire universe His kingship with His divine and heavenly authority for the shame of Satan, the defeated enemy of God, who will then be bound and imprisoned in the abyss, the bottomless pit Rev 20:2-3 .
[127]  As the Lamp of the Holy City, Shining with God as Light from within the New Jerusalem over the Nations
[128]  "The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
