<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE FESTIVALS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 23:1-14</h1><p>In this message we come to a wonderful matter in the book of Leviticus—the festivals.<p>According to the sequence of this book, by the end of chapter twenty-two we have been brought from our uncleanness to the priesthood with its enjoyment. The next item is the festivals, which are for rest and enjoyment, both of which are types of Christ as our rest and enjoyment. This indicates that in Leviticus, a book of God’s priesthood for God’s service in the fellowship of God, our service results, issues, in Christ as the rest and enjoyment we have with God and with one another. In other words, the issue of this service is the festivals.<p>These festivals did not take place occasionally at certain times. On the contrary, they were appointed by God, ordained by Him. God ordained the festivals that His people might rest with Him and be joyful with Him, that they might enjoy all that He has provided for His redeemed people. They were to enjoy all these things with God and with one another.<h2 class=head1>I. THE SEASONS APPOINTED BY JEHOVAH AS HOLY CONVOCATIONS</h2><p>Leviticus 23:2 says, “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, The appointed seasons of Jehovah which you shall proclaim as holy convocations—My appointed seasons are these.” The word “convocation” denotes something larger and more serious than a meeting. A convocation is a special assembly called for a special and particular purpose. The seasons appointed by Jehovah as holy convocations signify the gathering of God’s redeemed people to have a festival with God for His joy and enjoyment that the redeemed may participate in it with Him and with one another. A festival, therefore, was for nothing except rest and enjoyment. This rest and enjoyment were not individual but corporate.<h2 class=head2>A. The Weekly Season—the Sabbath</h2><p>“Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to Jehovah wherever you dwell” (v. 3). The weekly season—the sabbath—signifies rest for God’s redeemed people to enjoy with God and with one another. Every seven days there was to be a day for rest and enjoyment. On that day there was to be an assembly, a holy convocation. This indicates that on the sabbath God’s redeemed people were to gather together. If they did not come together, they would have been able to enjoy rest with God, but they could not have enjoyed rest with God and with one another in a corporate way.
