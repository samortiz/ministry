   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We who serve as ministers of God s word must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not how much of the Scriptures we understand, how many biblical truths we have seen, or how many verses we can quote.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These will not constitute us as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see the biblical truth, and we need to quote and understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in addition to these things we need one basic ingredient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have this basic ingredient, we have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without it, we do not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This basic ingredient is the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ministry of the word needs the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One must not only speak the same word but have the same revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without the same revelation, the ministry of the word ceases to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be thoroughly and unmistakably clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has to speak the same thing again today before the word will produce the same effect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God used His word once.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has to use the same word again today; His anointing has to be upon the same word before it will become effective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must see the balance here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, God has to use the word that He once released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we preach God s word, we do not have to look for new words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we should base our speaking on what has already been spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet on the other hand, what we preach should not be just the old words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It should be the same word and yet not the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the same word, because without that word as the basis, God cannot speak; there is no disagreement in His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet in another sense there is the fresh anointing and revelation of the Holy Spirit with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the fresh anointing and revelation of the Spirit, the same word will not produce the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man has to maintain a proper balance between these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One great temptation today is that man seeks and hopes merely to repeat the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He thinks that by speaking the same thing, he will repeat the same power, light, and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must remember that these are things that belong to two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You can repeat the same words, the same doctrines, the same testimonies, the same parables, and the same expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These things can be repeated, and man can repeat them with his own power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But while the words may be repeated, God may not repeat His use of these words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can repeat the outward things, but you cannot repeat the inward things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s realm remains God s realm, and our realm remains our realm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another illustration may make things even clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s speaking is in the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Resurrection does not give life; it merely calls to life what is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The birth of a baby is not resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when a dead man comes out of the tomb, that is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The daughter of Jairus was resurrected, the only son of the widow of Nain was resurrected, and Lazarus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were dead and then became alive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s ministers of the word serve according to the principle of resurrection today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God put His life in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word is still here, but God has to breathe His life into His word once more.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The principle of resurrection is different from the principle of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first time a word was released, it was released according to the principle of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the word was spoken, something was created.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A son was born; there was a new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the ministry of the word does not function this way today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s word is already here, and He is merely repeating what He has already spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is putting His life into His word once more, and when this word becomes living in man, it is revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Aaron s rod was a type of resurrection, because at one time the rod was living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In fact, all the rods were living at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They were not made of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They were wood and had life in them at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when life left, the wood became a dead rod.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Aaron s rod was the only exception.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was placed before the ark, and it sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s word is based on the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There was no need to get another piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The original rod sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God s word is one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is only one word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot set aside the Bible to preach God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The rod remains the same, but when life visits it again, we have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It must be the same rod, and life must enter the rod a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It must be the same word, but life must enter the word again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Life has to enter the word again and again, revelation has to come upon it again and again, and light has to shine upon it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only then is the word living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Anyone who tries to reject the Bible is rejected by God because he is rejecting the words that God has written down.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every word of the Scriptures is God s inspiration, and we have to honor it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Without it as the foundation, there is no orthodox faith, and there is no revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yet with the words of the Scriptures, there is still the need for man to go to God to receive revelation and light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is the same word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But upon this same word there is the need for the same revelation to be revealed once again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The rod remains the same, but fresh life has to enter it once more before it will sprout, blossom, and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is what God s word is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the meaning of the revelation of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is one inspiration, but there must be repeated revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God s one word has to be spoken by Him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have one Bible, but we need a continual anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Only then will there be the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whenever a man tries to explain the Bible without the anointing, revelation, or light, the ministry of the word stops in him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must pay attention to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Man s diligence, memory, understanding, and intelligence are all useful.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But they are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God must grant mercy to a man and must speak to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In reality, if a man does not hear God s speaking, he can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God must be willing to speak to man again.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If God does not want to speak, man can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If the Lord will not speak, the ministers will not accomplish anything even if they all speak.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is a great thing for the Lord to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If He does not speak, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even if man tries his best to speak, no result will come.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The more one tries to speak in the physical realm, the more he will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The more one speaks in the spiritual realm, the more the speaking will work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The more you learn to speak according to your spirit, the more you will realize that this is something that is beyond anyone s control.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The words can be the same, the sounds can be the same, and even the inward feelings can be the same, but what is released will not be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There can be a word-for-word, sentence-by-sentence correspondence.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The whole message can be repeated verbatim, and everything can be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But what is released will not be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We must remember that only God can speak God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Bible is God s word, and we need God to speak this word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The work of the ministers is to allow God to speak this word once again.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As oracles of God, when we allow God the liberty to speak His word, there is the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We can only serve within this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The difference between theology and God s speaking is intrinsically very great.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Whenever we listen to a sermon, we should never just consider whether or not the doctrine is right, the teaching is scriptural, and the truth is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is not to put down these factors.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>However, everyone who has been taught by God and whose eyes are opened should know what kind of sermon is being spoken as soon as he sits down to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>A person may have a good mind, yet he may not have God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Another person may not have a quick mind, yet God s word is with him.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>There is a fundamental difference between God speaking through a person and not speaking through a person.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If all the brothers could learn this lesson, the church would not pay that much attention to gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Instead, it would pay more attention to ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The problem today is that many young brothers and sisters cannot tell the difference between gifts and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This is the reason that gifts are more welcome and popular in the church, while ministry is neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The words may be the same in both cases, but the reality is different.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The two may be the same in letters, in outward appearance, but those who have the discernment can tell the difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>A brother once said, I have preached everything that Brother So-and-so preached.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This brother had a good mind and thought that he could preach just as well as others.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He did not realize that his preaching was in an entirely different realm.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Some people preach according to their mind, while others preach according to their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>These are two entirely different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We should never think that just by repeating the same words we will produce the same results.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Some can speak the same words, but God may not speak through them.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Others have the ministry of the word because God speaks through them.</S>
