   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN DEALING WITH THE MATTER OF RESURRECTION 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:29-44</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Resurrection is a fact which has much to do with our daily life as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The daily life of a Christian actually depends on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, our Christian hope depends on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there were no resurrection, there would be no hope, and we would be the most miserable people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ s resurrection is also related to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The carrying out of the divine administration depends on our experience of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not have Christ as the resurrection life within us, we cannot be living members of His Body for the carrying out of God s administration so that Christ may reign until He subdues all His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we shall consider the moral influence of resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>29-34 and the definition of resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>35-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE MORAL INFLUENCE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen that verses 20 through 28 may be regarded as a parenthesis.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This would then connect verse 29 to verse 18, and verses 30 through 32 to verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. If There Is No Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 29 Paul says, Otherwise, what shall they do who are being baptized for the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the dead are actually not raised, why indeed are they baptized for them?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The phrase baptized for the dead means to be baptized for others who are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was not an official matter generally practiced by the early churches, but a personal activity of some individual believers for dead persons for whom they were concerned who may have believed in the Lord but were not baptized before they died.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They did this in hope of their resurrection from among the dead at the Lord s coming back 1 Thes 4:16 , since in baptism resurrection is strongly signified Col 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The apostle uses what they did to strengthen the truth of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean, however, that he sanctions baptism by some believers for the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 29 the word for actually means on behalf of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some believers had relatives, neighbors, or friends who also believed in the Lord, but who died without being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Out of love for them, certain believers were baptized on behalf of the ones who had died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was not taught by the apostles, but we know from church history it was practiced by the believers, although the practice was not common.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that one believer would be baptized on behalf of another believer who had died signifies a strong belief in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Baptism signifies death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if there is no resurrection and if Christians simply die and are buried, why would someone be baptized on behalf of the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fact that someone would be baptized for the dead indicates a belief, an expectation, that the dead one would be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul refers to this practice as part of his rebuttal against the heresy which claimed that there was no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here Paul seems to be saying, If the dead are not raised, then why are others baptized for them to signify that they will be resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is Paul s meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 30 Paul goes on to say, Why also are we in danger every hour?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is no resurrection, then why would Paul allow himself to be in danger every hour?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why would he daily risk his life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, if there is no resurrection, he should enjoy this present life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 31 Paul continues, Daily I die, I protest by the boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here the word die means to risk one s life, to be in danger of death, to face death, and to die to self 2 Cor 11:23; 4:11; 1:8-9; Rom 8:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Corinthian believers were the fruit of the apostle s labor, a labor in which he risked his life and was in danger of death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In them the apostle can boast of this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this boasting he protests that daily he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The apostle s boasting in the Corinthians as the fruit of the risk of his life is in Christ, not in himself, because his labor is not by himself but by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul was like a soldier risking his life on the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He fought for God s kingdom, and daily he died for the sake of the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he came to preach the gospel to them, he risked his life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While he was in Corinth, he died daily.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was not an easy thing for Paul to come to Corinth in the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This world was opposed to anything Jewish and also opposed to anything Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, Paul daily risked his life in order to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But because of his willingness to die daily, a number of those at Corinth were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 32 Paul uses a figure of speech: If after the manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The phrase wild beasts used here is a figure of speech denoting evil persons or matters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The manner of men in fighting against any evil person or matter is to receive a temporal reward.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the apostle will be rewarded for his fighting with evil persons and matters for the gospel s sake at the resurrection in the future Luke 14:14; 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know from Acts 19 that Paul was fighting against wild beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Both the Jews and the Gentiles at Ephesus strongly opposed him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, he had to fight against evil persons and evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if there were no resurrection, what profit would it have been to Paul to fight in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As Paul says, If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This appears to be a quotation of a saying of that day, a maxim of the Epicureans.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If there is no resurrection, we believers shall have no hope in the future and thus become the most miserable of all men v. 19 . If so, we should enjoy our life today, forgetting the future, like the Epicureans.</S>
