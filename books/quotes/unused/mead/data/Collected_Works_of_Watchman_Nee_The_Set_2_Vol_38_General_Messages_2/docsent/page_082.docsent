   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN THE NORMAL MARRIAGE LIFE A word given at a wedding on October 2, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Our Lord Jesus, we thank and praise You because all good things come from You.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We acknowledge that all grace flows from You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, we are gathered together this afternoon for the wedding of our Brother Yang and Sister Wu.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We pray that You would bless this new couple and that they would see that everything is out of Your grace and Your love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May You open their eyes to see the immensity of their responsibility and to see how great a challenge it is to be a husband and how great a challenge it is to be a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Show them that the marital relationship can be a happy relationship and that it can also be a difficult relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Show them that the flesh cannot help them through such a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, give them the grace to learn how to be a husband and how to be a wife and to learn to glorify Your name daily.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May this act today, this union today, glorify Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May it not bring shame to Your name or mockery from unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, may the husband be a real husband, bearing the responsibility of the house, and the head in everything, and may the wife submit as a woman should in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our Lord, may this couple express Your love, Your authority, and Your proper human virtues in their family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May You give them grace and bless them so that they may be blessed persons in their respective positions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, be gracious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We commit the two of them into Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May they glorify You daily, may the work of their hands glorify You, and may everything in this family glorify You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bless them and bless all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the name of the Lord Jesus, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HUSBANDS LOVING WIVES AND</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WIVES BEING SUBJECT TO HUSBANDS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us read a very familiar passage: "But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her" Eph 5:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brothers have been telling me for many days that I have to attend this meeting today and that I have to speak a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I prayed and considered what I should speak and how I should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God gave me these two very familiar verses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Needless to say, this is a happy occasion and most people like to say "congratulations."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While this, of course, is a fact, we also have to admit that there are troubles ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before a person is married, he or she may have no trouble being a single person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after a person is married, there is definitely trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Troubles for a single person are a possibility, but troubles for a married couple are a certainty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are not prepared to face these troubles, we will see one trouble after another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Troubles will perpetuate and propagate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first thing a Christian should realize is that no trouble within a family can be solved instantaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LEARNING TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND AND A GOOD WIFE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Yang, do not think that you can be a proper husband in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may need three to five years to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sister Wu, I will say the same to you; it takes three to five years before you learn how to be a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet I must say that you have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do not learn, you will never be able.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Never think that you are born a husband or that you are born a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many brothers and sisters think that they can become husbands and wives without learning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some think that when a man earns forty to fifty dollars a month, has grown to over five feet in height, and is twenty-four or twenty-five years old, he is qualified to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Unless you are determined to learn to be a wife, you will not succeed in becoming a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Unless you are determined to learn to be a husband, you will not succeed in becoming a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a student does not have the heart to be a student, he cannot be a student.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If an employee does not have the heart to be a good employee, he cannot be an employee.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Similarly, if you do not have the heart to be a husband or a wife, you cannot be a husband or a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many things come by accident; many things can be done mindlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But a good husband or good wife does not come by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every good husband and every good wife become so through learning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am not preaching a sermon this afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I only want to ask whether our brother and our sister have the heart to be a husband and a wife or whether they are merely trying their luck.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no such thing as being fortunate by chance in marriage.</S>
