   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TALK TO THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND WHO HAVE HANDED OVER THEMSELVES Not Being Unequally Yoked</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>with the Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tonight, we have something to say to those brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed over themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have gathered together these brothers who have handed over themselves in order to have some fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before you handed over yourselves, there may have been some people whom you had business dealings with.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may at present also have some unbelieving business partners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At a certain time, these relationships will have to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for this is that your goal and their goals are not the same, and sooner or later there will be conflicts of interests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We hope that you will do your best to separate yourselves from them within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Learning to Coordinate One with Another</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second thing is that you have to learn to coordinate one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The money you earn is for God, and the money I earn is also for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to learn to be delivered from our individual circles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What I have personally is not a concern of my own, but a concern of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These concerns should be considered within the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Formerly, your goal was for yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now your goal is changed, and this puts all of us together in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LEARNING FROM THE FAILURE OF THE PAST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Witness Lee: Concerning going into business, we had some experiences in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, in the beginning everyone shared everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a while, each one began to have some possessions and works of his own, and some degradations set in with respect to money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Still later, the brothers and sisters began to form partnerships in investments and business enterprises, and the situation became even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to my knowledge, not once did we see a good result when brothers went into business together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Cases of arbitrations and settlements were especially frequent among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why at that time I advised everyone not to go into business ventures together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, it is better that they should engage in business alone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING DELIVERED FROM RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Despite what I said, we saw all the time that some have the capital, but are unable to operate a business, whereas others can operate a business, but do not have the capital.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In some cases, a person has both, but does not have the strength to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past, we did not have enough light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, when the brothers came together, it was difficult for them to be without opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once opinion came in, the testimony was lost, and what was done was not done to the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason we could not handle the matter properly was that we were not delivered from riches themselves yet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of this, there was no coordination among us, and we became poor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As far as the work is concerned, we are the poorest among all Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today I sent out fifteen to sixteen hundred letters to the brothers and sisters to fellowship with them about the purchase of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was not happy in my heart about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our present meeting hall is already packed to the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our present meeting hall will not meet even a fraction of the present need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the while, we are telling the saints to bring others to our gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where are they going to sit if they all come?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But what is the reason that we are so poor?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reason is that money has been kept back in our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, we have become so fallen that all our hands have become empty again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The work has no money, and you have no money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason for our poverty is that we have not been delivered from riches yet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the money goes into your pocket, your heart falls in love with money.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The minute we start arguing, all blessings are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You said that you have handed over yourselves, and you have listed all your possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when I read the lists over and over again, I find nothing that can be taken up by us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today the amount of spiritual needs should be matched by the amount of material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At present, it is still right for us to go into business.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in order to do that, we must first hand over our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps some brothers disagree with going into business together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But how much can one person's capital do?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The move of the gospel must catch up with the need of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to catch up with the age, there is the need for coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the world, men conduct business by taking an airplane and by doing it on a large scale.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we have not given our time to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we preach the gospel, we do not have any advertisements, and we do not do anything in the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The reason for this is that we do not have the money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If those brothers who are in business indeed realize the great need in the gospel, they should rise up to do something in an aggressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All that the brothers need to do is to keep enough for their own use; the rest they should offer up to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do not offer up ourselves in this way, there is not much hope that we can go on.</S>
