   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO BASING THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON A CONSIDERATION OF OUR HISTORY 2 THE BLESSING OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There has been no lack of the Lord s mercy among us; to this day the Lord s recovery is still among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The greatest proof of this is that the Lord s speaking among us has not ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The invention of various means of transportation and the development of various methods of communication, such as the telephone, telegraph, television, and radio have made the world smaller, just like a village.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In former days there were less than one hundred homes in a village, and many factors influenced communication.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the village was on a river, when the river flooded, the roads were impassable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>People had to wait until the waters receded before they could resume communication.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, however, news spreads quickly from one place in the world to another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though we are in the Far East, what happens anywhere in the world will be transmitted to us; it is very easy for us to receive news from other parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have observed that for the past thirty-nine years, from the end of the Second World War in 1945 until today in 1984, only a few books of spiritual value have been published; this includes those published in English and in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many reference books that expound the meaning of words used in the Bible in their original language have been published in America during the last twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The publication of such books has been very helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apart from these reference books, however, there has been a lack of publications with spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the end of the last century and at the beginning of this century, there was an abundant supply of spiritual materials; expositions of the Bible were published in great quantities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we have not seen such a situation in the past few years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, over the past eleven years the semiannual trainings in the Lord s recovery have been trainings on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This year there will be one more training, from the standpoint of life, in which we will complete the Life-study of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have strong proof that the Life-study messages are warmly received everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have received over a thousand letters of appreciation from the five continents concerning the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have the opportunity, we want to print these letters so that everyone can read the words of appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For more than fifty years we have printed new books every month.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have observed that during the past fifty years, Christians have begun to treasure the Bible more they like to read expositions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that Christians desire the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the main direction of our work is to strengthen the truth; the truth among us should surpass our experience in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should never say that life comes first; actually, truth should be first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Andrew Murray once said that what a strong minister of the word speaks should always surpass his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If his speaking is not higher than his experience, his ministry is not high.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, the truth should have preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must first strengthen the truth among us, then life, and then the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our church life must be uplifted; this requires us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to preach the gospel, we must open our homes and use them for the gospel because the Bible clearly shows that the early believers preached the gospel from house to house Acts 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Meeting in the homes is the way to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MEETING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the time of the apostles, we are probably the only group of believers who practice the church life by meeting in districts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are definitely the first group of Christians to meet in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we were in mainland China, we did not meet in small groups; we met only in districts and in halls.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was not until we came to Taiwan that we began to meet in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First we met in halls, then the halls were divided into districts, and then the districts were formed into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This practice is unique among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We practiced this from 1949 to 1957, and our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Based on this, we can say that we were successful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regrettably, we were distracted and abandoned this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, our numbers no longer increased.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We regret this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We recently read a book by a Catholic priest that was published in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The book praises our practice of meeting in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When people in Hong Kong build houses, they drive beams into the ground for support.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, the book implies that if the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches want to be rooted and to spread, they must build with beams; they must pay attention to basic matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The book makes particular reference to meeting from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It cites the local church in Taiwan and praises us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in these few years we have neglected the practice of meeting from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is regrettable.</S>
