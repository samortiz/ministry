   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL S BURDEN FOR JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At a time when Paul was in a very difficult situation and also had an excellent opportunity to carry out God s New Testament economy, he purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although he was very much occupied with his work in Ephesus, his spirit was burdened for Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we read Romans 15:25-31, we shall see that Paul was burdened to bring financial help from the churches in Macedonia and Achaia to the poor saints in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul also refers to this in 2 Corinthians 8, where he indicates that the giving of material things is altogether a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, Paul s purpose in going to Jerusalem was apparently to minister to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, Paul had a deeper reason for purposing in spirit to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that from the time of Acts 15 Paul did not have peace concerning the situation in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we study the book of Acts and all of Paul s Epistles, we shall have a clear view of the Lord s move on earth in His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s move started from Jerusalem and eventually reached Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The flow of the Lord s move went from Jerusalem to Antioch, and turned from Antioch to the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the source, the spring, of this flow in Jerusalem had been poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the source was poisoned, the poison would be carried by the flow wherever it went.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the reason Paul could not be at peace concerning the situation in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is likely that Paul had the burden to help Peter and James to improve or adjust the situation in the church at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The situation there was one of mixture a mixture of God s New Testament economy with the things of the Old Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have seen, this mixture is evident in James fellowship in 15:13-21.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we shall see, the mixture of God s New Testament economy with the old dispensation is very obvious in chapter twenty-one of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This mixture was very offensive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Realizing that the problem still existed in Jerusalem, Paul was not at peace about the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that at the end of his second journey of ministry Paul went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church there 18:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He made this trip to Jerusalem because he always endeavored to maintain the oneness of the Body and to keep a pleasant feeling between him and the saints in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this we see that whenever there was an opportunity Paul would go to Jerusalem to visit the church in order to keep a pleasant relationship between him and the church and also to seek to render some help to the situation there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Paul was concerned for Jerusalem, he purposed in spirit, in spite of the difficult and promising situation he was in, to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A BROADENED HEART FOR THE LORD S INTEREST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Acts 19:21 indicates that Paul had a broadened heart for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As he was encountering attack at Ephesus and carrying on his ministry, he still purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, and from there he was eager to go to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning this, he said, I must also see Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you consult a map, you will see that Ephesus, in Asia Minor, was midway between Jerusalem to the east and Rome to the west.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While Paul was laboring and facing attack at Ephesus, he had the heart to care for the situation in Jerusalem and also to see Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What largeness of heart Paul had!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not many of us have such a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, often those who are laboring in a certain place will say, I am very busy here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not have the heart to care for any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, I am facing much opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can I have the burden for other places?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul s attitude was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the midst of his situation he could still purpose in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, and then express the desire to see Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have indicated, Paul eventually went to Jerusalem, and, in a marvelous and sovereign way, he did see Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Galatians 2:8, Paul s part of the New Testament ministry was among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although his burden was for the ministry among the Gentiles, he was still concerned for the Lord s interest universally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His primary concern was for the whole Body of Christ, not only for his part of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul realized that it would be very difficult for the Body of Christ to be built up fully as long as the religious mixture in Jerusalem was allowed to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because he had a clear view concerning the Lord s New Testament move, he was troubled by the situation in Jerusalem, especially as it related to God s New Testament economy to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>GOD S ECONOMY AND THE LORD S UP-TO-DATE MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the fourth message of this Life-study of Acts we pointed out the need for a dispensational transfer, a transfer out of the old dispensation into God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In studying the book of Acts it is important that we see all the crucial matters related to this transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are clear concerning these matters, then we shall understand today s situation, and we shall know where we need to be and what we need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not remain where Apollos was in chapter eighteen, but go further to follow the apostle Paul, the one whose eyes were opened to see fully God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in studying this book I do not have the heart for other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My burden concerns God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If by the Lord s mercy we can be helped to see the crucial turning points of God s dispensation, I shall be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My desire is that the light regarding God s New Testament economy will penetrate our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this light penetrates us, then we shall see the Lord s up-to-date move in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe that this study of Acts will be helpful to us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to see that we are not carrying out an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, we are here in the up-to-date move of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we must have the vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have this vision, we shall be directed and carried on by it in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have this vision, we shall not be distracted by today s situation, no matter what it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we have this vision, we shall know where we are and where we are going.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Having a clear view concerning God s economy in this age, we shall know what our goal is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We believe that our God is still moving, that He is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we need to be in His up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may compare the view of God s economy presented in Acts to a jig-saw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle are put together, we have a complete scene.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In like manner, throughout the book of Acts we have various pieces of a complete puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we fit these pieces together properly, we shall see a clear and full view of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we reach the end of this Life-study we shall have all the necessary pieces, we shall fit them all together, and we shall see the complete scene of the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am especially burdened that the young people see the view of God s economy presented in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In order for the Lord Jesus to come back, His bride needs to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Consider the situation today in relation to the readiness of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To be sure, the bride is not yet ready.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The only way the bride can be prepared is the way of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I say this so that we all may know what the Lord is doing here in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we know what the Lord is doing, then we shall know where we are and what our goal should be.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May we all be helped through this study of the book of Acts to be fully up-to-date in the Lord s move for the carrying out of God s New Testament economy.</S>
