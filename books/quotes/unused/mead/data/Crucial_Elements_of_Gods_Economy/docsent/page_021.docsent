   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OLD TESTAMENT LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE LAW OF BONDAGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Old Testament law, the law given through Moses, was a law of bondage Gal 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we are not able to keep the Old Testament law, we are bound by it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The law says, You shall not covet Exo 20:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A missionary in China once preached the gospel to his cook, explaining that all people are sinners and need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the cook resisted, claiming that he was a good man who never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The missionary wisely did not argue with the cook but instead began to talk about a fine horse that the missionary owned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cook immediately began to think about the missionary s horse and how he could obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The next day, when the missionary spoke again to the cook concerning all men needing salvation, the cook again claimed to be a good man who never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The missionary then asked what the cook had been thinking about since their previous conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The cook admitted that he had been thinking about the missionary s horse and how to obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The missionary pointed out that this was covetousness and was a sin, and the cook was convicted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE NEW TESTAMENT LAW</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEING THE LAW OF FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because no one can keep the Old Testament law, it is the law of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the New Testament law, which is written upon our hearts, frees us, it is a law of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 8:2a says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we are under the law of freedom, not under the law of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law of freedom is written not on stone but upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many saints have testified that as they were going to an ungodly place, although they were outwardly claiming to be liberated, something bothered them within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This inward feeling, sensation, or consciousness is the function of the law written upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that we are indeed under a law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of how much we believers may declare that we have been liberated, there is always a living law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we do something that offends God, this living law within rebukes us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we are always under the inner law, if we obey this law, it immediately frees us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people are under the bondage of movies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A young brother may lie to his mother, telling her that he is going to the library when he is actually going to a movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After returning home, the young brother may lie again when his mother asks about what he studied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By telling two lies, both of which will be judged by God, this young brother has shown that he is bound by movies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the law written in our hearts can free us from such bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This law frees us by troubling us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before being saved, a young man may have felt fine and even proud after deceiving his mother in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After being saved, however, something within will bother him both about going to a movie and about lying to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the law of freedom bothers us, troubling us within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This law is very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we disregard the troubling within, this law will simply continue to trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sooner or later, we will be subdued because a bothering element has been written upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apparently, to be a Christian is to have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, however, after becoming Christians, we do not always have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are often bothered by the One who is within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This bothering One will not stop His bothering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may continue bothering us for years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will never convince Him to allow us to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will patiently and gently continue bothering us until He subdues us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He subdues us, the law within becomes the law of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The law of freedom can thus free us from the bondage of movies or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not think that today we are not under any law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christians are under the strictest law; it binds us even in minor points.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This law, which is within every believer, requires not only that we speak the truth but also that every word be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we love the Lord, the more this law will operate by troubling us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before being saved, we were lawless, but after being saved, we become people of law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s law is written upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1 Corinthians 9:21 Paul says, I am not without law to God but within law to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are under the law to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is a new law in the New Testament, the law of freedom, which is also called the law of Christ Gal 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are under the law of freedom, the law of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every Christian is a lawful person, a person under law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This law is stricter and finer than the old law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have only a little pride within us, although no one may perceive it, the law within will condemn our pride.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to realize that we are under this law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>THE NEW TESTAMENT COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who misuse Romans 6:14 as a justification to live lawlessly say that as New Testament believers we should not be under any commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, there are far more than ten commandments in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first commandment in the New Testament is repent and believe Mark 1:15 ; the second is be baptized Acts 2:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Other commandments in the New Testament are love one another John 13:34 , unceasingly pray 1 Thes 5:17 , and always rejoice v. 16 . If we do not rejoice, we are disobeying God s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Another commandment in the New Testament says, In nothing be anxious Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be anxious is to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Parents know that the more children they have, the more anxieties they have.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My mother often worried about her second daughter, my sister, who was teaching hundreds of miles away in another province.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One morning my mother was nearly weeping and seemed to be angry with me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I asked, Mother, what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She said, It has been four weeks since we received a letter from your sister, but you have not said a word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Last night I dreamed that she is very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You do not have a heart for your sister.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I said, Mother, this was only a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, this only made her more upset.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I did not understand that what she really wanted was for me to send a telegram to check on my sister.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>She did not say this but instead rebuked me with the intention that I would understand her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I said many things to appease her, but nothing worked.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Finally, she said, Why are you so dull?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Don t you know that you should send a telegram?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I immediately ran to send the telegram, and that afternoon the reply came from my sister that all was well.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we are anxious about anything, we commit a sin, for the New Testament says, In nothing be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Romans 12:2a says, Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Verse 11 says, Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>These also are commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If our spirit is not burning, we are disobeying a commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, we cannot say that we are not under any commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The New Testament is full of commandments that are even finer than the law in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Second Timothy 2:22 says, Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is a commandment to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The young people should not believe that they cannot overcome their flesh and that they should therefore allow their flesh to do whatever it desires.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is terrible lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Young believers should heed the commandment to flee youthful lusts.</S>
