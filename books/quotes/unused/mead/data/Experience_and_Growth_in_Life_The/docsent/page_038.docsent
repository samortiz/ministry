   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS OUR DAILY VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must build up a proper daily life with a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To merely behave in a certain way is a performance and is hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our living should not be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we should be proper persons with a proper living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"To live Christ" is not merely a slogan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The living of Christ must be the reality of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The revelations in Philippians 1 through 3 concerning the salvation and righteousness of God are very high.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, they all point to the living of Christ as the divine reality in our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in chapter four Paul applied these revelations to our practical daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 2 he said, "I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to verse 3, these were very good sisters who had been helpful to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These sisters were living Christ and magnifying Christ to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, they were still dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Spiritually speaking, they were appraised highly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their names are in the book of life, and they labored with Paul and Clement v. 3 , but in their practical life there was a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, we may speak of spiritual things, but our person may not be true, honorable, righteous, pure, and lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One aspect of our daily life is the way we dress.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should learn to dress properly at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To dress properly only when we know someone is coming to visit us is hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a genuine daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are loose in the matter of dress, we are probably loose in everything else as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, if we do not make our bed after rising in the morning, it is not likely that we can study the Bible very well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The very Christ whom we live and preach must be our daily virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our love for people should not merely be human love, but human love filled with and expressing the divine love, which is Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ethical philosophers of China stressed the development of the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They taught that we need to develop the sense of our conscience, which they called the "bright virtue."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If some would go to China to teach them of Christ as the divine love filling our love, the Chinese scholars could be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We not only have a conscience; we also have the embodiment of the processed Triune God, who today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the all-inclusive, consummated, sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a Christ is our motivator, the inward motivating power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ as our motivating power may be compared to an electric motor empowering the development of our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Philippians 1 the motivator is the Spirit of Jesus Christ v. 19 who is the bountiful, all-inclusive, all-capable, and all-sufficient supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ passed through incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement by the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now this Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter two the motivator is the inner-operating God v. 13 , the processed Triune God embodied in Christ who became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b . In chapter three the motivator is the power of Christ's resurrection, and this power is also the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ, the inner-operating God, and the power of His resurrection refer to the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The motivator in chapter four is seen in verse 13, which says, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This motivator is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the operating God, and the consummated Triune God as the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is not only in us, but we are also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this One who empowers and strengthens us, we can do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"All things" refers to every aspect of our human virtue, as spoken of in chapters one through four.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can be true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can live the top human life, full of human virtues filled with the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: How do we reconcile the high teachings in Philippians 1 through 3 with the emphasis on the details of our daily life in chapter four?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Answer: Living Christ and our daily life do not need to be reconciled; they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The very Christ whom we live and magnify in Philippians 1 should be our virtues in our daily life in Philippians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reality of all the items of our virtues, such as truthfulness, honor, righteousness, and purity, is Christ, who is the righteousness of God based on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Question: How can attention to the details in our daily life help us?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Answer: Attention to details will help us to go to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to have a morning watch to meet the Lord Jesus, to enjoy and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to have the assurance that through the cleansing of His blood we have the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The anointing is Christ moving in us, and the moving of Christ is His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Early in the morning, regardless of how busy we are, we must have at least some time to stay in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we will meet Him, and He will supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He will become the motivator and the "motor" for our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then, if we are wrong in some aspect of our daily life, He will bother us within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, we will learn how to live Christ.</S>
