<h2 class="head2">The Problem Created<br />
by the Spiritual Ministry in the West</h2>
<p>In 1954 some brothers felt that we needed to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who was well known for his spiritual ministry in the West. I fellowshipped with the brothers that in terms of knowing a person or a matter, we never pay attention to big things; rather, it is in the small things that we see the true situation of a person. From the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we were enlightened by the Lord to drop Christmas. Hence, we do not celebrate Christmas, nor do we receive or send Christmas cards. However, this brother in the January 1955 issue of his magazine, <em>A Witness and a Testimony,</em> released an official note of appreciation to those who sent him Christmas cards. Although this was a small matter, it revealed his condition. If we invited him, I felt that there could be a problem, and that both sides would be hurt in the process. It would be safer for us to keep some distance between him and us. Brother Nee stayed with Brother Austin-Sparks for more than a year, from 1937 to 1938. Brother Nee later told me that although Brother Sparks has a portion in spiritual matters, he did not see nor would he receive any light concerning the practicality of the church. If Brother Nee was not able to convince him concerning the practicality of the church, how could we persuade him?</p>
<p>Initially, the brothers received this fellowship. However, not long afterward they brought this matter up again, saying that they needed the spiritual portion from Brother Austin-Sparks. At that time, it would have been inappropriate for me to insist on not inviting him. So I wrote an invitation letter in English and formally invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come. He came in 1955. During that visit he did not touch the matter of the church. He ministered according to his portion. We were genuinely helped, and everyone felt good.</p>
<p>In 1957 we invited Brother Austin-Sparks again. This time he stayed with us for a longer time. One day we arranged for Brother Austin-Sparks to speak particularly to the one hundred or more co-workers that we had, and I was the translator. The brother who requested the time of fellowship asked Brother Austin-Sparks what he thought about our work, since this was his second visit. Upon hearing this question, I knew that this brother had dissenting thoughts; otherwise, he would not have asked someone from a faraway place such a question.</p>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks immediately replied, &ldquo;When I came here last time, I did have some feelings, but I decided not to say anything. This time I came prepared to speak. Please tell me, why do the brothers who are in the military service put their caps on before they leave the meeting hall?&rdquo; At that time we had many brothers who were in the military, and they came to the meeting in their uniforms. When it was announced that the meeting was over, the brothers in the military would put on their caps while leaving their seats. According to Western custom, however, a man should never put on his hat while he is inside a building; there is no exception for the military. A man can put on his hat only after he leaves the building. This is the custom in the West, whether or not one is a believer. After Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s question, a brother explained, &ldquo;According to Chinese custom, soldiers wear their caps everywhere. However, when the brothers in the military come to the meeting, according to the teaching in the Bible (1 Cor. 11:4, 7), they do not cover their heads during prayer and the giving of a message. They put on their caps only at the end of the meeting, after the announcement of the dismissal of the meeting. This is very appropriate.&rdquo; After Brother Austin-Sparks heard this, he asked, &ldquo;Do you act in accordance to your custom or in accordance to the Bible?&rdquo; Although I felt inwardly that his question was unjustified, I translated what he said. I knew that Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s argument was irrational, because he was keeping the Western custom, which dictates that a man can wear a hat only when he is outside a building, but we were keeping the teaching of the Bible.</p>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks also brought up another issue. He said that our bread-breaking meeting was in confusion, disorderly, because one person could call a hymn and another person could speak a few words. Concerning this matter, at his invitation I went to London in 1958 and stayed with his group for four weeks and attended their meetings. Their bread-breaking meeting was taken care of only by Brother Austin-Sparks. He prayed, chose hymns, and gave the message. It was only in the last section of the meeting that there were ten minutes of free worship. The proceeding of the meeting was very proper and was conducted entirely according to his instructions. The table displayed a row of baskets, containing small pieces of bread, and also small cups. After he prayed and gave a message, he said, &ldquo;Now is the time we break the bread.&rdquo; Then seven deacons came and stood before him, he passed the breadbaskets to them, and they withdrew. The breadbaskets were passed to each row, and everyone took a piece of bread and waited. After all seven baskets were distributed, the seven deacons lined up and returned the empty baskets one by one to Brother Austin-Sparks. Brother Austin-Sparks received the baskets, took a piece of bread, and said, &ldquo;Now we will partake of this bread together.&rdquo; After partaking of the bread, they followed the same procedure for distributing and drinking of the cup. If we compare their bread-breaking meeting with our bread-breaking meeting, ours would certainly appear disorderly to Brother Austin-Sparks. During the time of our fellowship, he was very critical of our bread-breaking meeting. I did not say much at the time, but I knew inwardly that problems would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>During his visit, we held a conference and a training. Whenever there was a free evening, some guests from England, America, Denmark, and Hong Kong would come together with a dozen local brothers, and we would have some free fellowship. I had fellowshipped with the brothers in advance and said that it would be better to avoid questions concerning the church with Brother Austin-Sparks, because such questions would not be profitable to anyone. Rather, it would be better to let him carry out his spiritual ministry and render the supply of his portion to us. Then we could send him off properly and still be able to maintain fellowship. The brothers all agreed. However, one evening as we sat in silence, a brother said, &ldquo;Brother Austin-Sparks, suppose there are five groups in Taipei that meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Please tell us which group is right and which is not right?&rdquo; Upon hearing this question, I knew that this was a &ldquo;bomb.&rdquo; Brother Austin-Sparks said, &ldquo;None of the groups is absolutely right. All five of them are relatively right.&rdquo; Thus, a debate ensued. At the time I felt that because I was translating, I should keep a neutral position. In addition, since I was the one who wrote and invited Brother Austin-Sparks for the second visit, I should be polite to our guest. Hence, I only translated for both sides and did not speak anything of my own.</p>
