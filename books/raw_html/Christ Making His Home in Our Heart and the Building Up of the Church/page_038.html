	 <h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Pass through Trials<br />
in Following the Lord</h2>
<p>The saints who are serving are still passing through trials. For this reason, many do not have a sense of freshness concerning spiritual matters, including their service and spiritual pursuit. This is something we all experience in following the Lord, because we all must pass through trials. The truths we know need to be tested, our way needs to be tested, and our faith also needs to be tested. When we are saved, we sense the sweetness of God&rsquo;s salvation, and our feeling is fresh. Furthermore, we have the full assurance that God exists, that the Lord is our Savior, that we have been forgiven of our sins, and that we have been regenerated. These things seem to be more real to us than physical things. However, we will eventually be tested. God will test us, and He will let us test His salvation. He will even allow us to test Him.</p>
<p>Every person who is saved has doubts concerning God. After I had been saved for some time, I was tested and began questioning myself. I asked whether I made a mistake in believing and whether God was dependable. Although I testified often concerning God&rsquo;s answering my prayers, I still had questions concerning God, Christ, and salvation. I believe that every brother and sister has experienced this. Perhaps some are still on a &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; and have not had such a situation. Nevertheless, we all will pass through trials and experience a time of testing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Different in Our Way, Living, and Pursuit</h2>
<p>In many aspects we are different from those in Christianity because of our need to depend on faith. Our way is different from the way taken by those in Christianity, our living is different from their living, and the spiritual goal that we pursue is different from theirs. These three matters are rather serious. Our way, living, and pursuit differ from the way, living, and pursuit of those in Christianity.</p>
<p>Most people in Christianity believe in God&rsquo;s existence, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and man&rsquo;s salvation. In addition to this general faith, we have seen the way of the church. We are taking a way that is rejected by Christianity; hence, our way is different from theirs. This is the first difference. Next, we are living a life of faith. I can testify that we live a life that is simple, yet it is a life of uncertainty. We have no assurance of our future. We do not know how we will live next year. Even though we have no assurance concerning our future, we continue to live this way before the Lord. We are willing to live a life of faith because we know the object of our faith. We are here to please the Lord. Otherwise, we would not be able to live a life in poverty or simplicity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are pursuing to know the Lord and to allow Him to grow in us. We pursue to live in Him and to please Him so that when we see Him face to face, we will not be put to shame. However, most Christians do not have such considerations. They know that in their Christian life they should not commit sins, especially gross sins, and this is sufficient for them.</p>
<p>The way we take, the life we live, and what we pursue are all matters of faith. These matters cause us to go through trials so that we can know whether our way of faith, our life of faith, and our pursuit of faith are right. Some believers think that it is not necessary to have this kind of faith in order to be a pious Christian. They think that it is sufficient to pursue an overcoming life, growth in the Lord, and spiritual maturity. There are also believers who think that it is not necessary to live by faith or that it is wrong to experience poverty when serving the Lord. Even though such thoughts seem correct, intrinsically it is a matter of our attitude and our intention.</p>
<p>In 1935, after the first crisis in the church in Shanghai, I was tested severely with not only trials but also temptations. The church in Shanghai began meeting in 1927. In 1934 a crisis broke out, and all the burdens fell on my shoulders. I did not suffer because of the crisis, but I suffered because the senior co-workers, both brothers and sisters, all left Shanghai when the difficulties began. Consequently, the burdens and the situations that they left fell on my shoulders.</p>
<p>Even though I was thirty years old at the time, the entire situation fell on my shoulders, requiring that I deal with it. When I saw the situation, I could not but question the way I took and the object of my faith; I was tested. I asked myself whether this was the right way. I knew that I was called by the Lord, but was this the way to serve Him? At the time I felt that this way was extremely difficult. There was no one who could bear my burden or share the responsibility with me. I was tested. At the same time, the object of my faith was severely tested. I questioned why I should walk on this way, why I should serve in this way, why I should live in this way, and why I should pursue in this way. Every aspect of my being was tried. However, as a result of this testing, I decided, &ldquo;Since I am a man, I must be a Christian, and since I am a Christian, I must take the way of the church. If I would not take this way, I would not be an absolute Christian, and if I am not an absolute Christian, I should not be a Christian at all.&rdquo; My choice was clear.</p>
<p>I saw clearly that I could not shrink back, even though I had passed through many trials. As a conclusion I said, &ldquo;If I am a Christian, I must be absolute to serve the Lord, and if I am one who serves the Lord, I must take the way of the church, live a life of faith, and have a spiritual pursuit. I cannot take another way, live another kind of life, or have another pursuit.&rdquo; While I was passing through trials, I made up my mind that no matter how poor or how difficult my life would be, I would take this way. Even if others would not take this way, I would press forward and take this way.</p>
<p>In 1943 I was imprisoned by the Japanese army and entered into a very deep and dark valley of the shadow of death. It was an unprecedented time of trials. To this day I have not been tried in such a way. The livelihood of my family was in question. I was sick in bed and could not take care of my children; my family was in a destitute situation. On one hand, I was being tried, but on the other hand, I was testing this way. I doubted whether this was the right way and whether I was right concerning this way. Otherwise, how could I have been in such a situation?</p>
<p>During my years of service to the Lord, I have sensed the Lord&rsquo;s presence. His presence was especially strong in 1942. At this time the church in Chefoo had a great revival, and the work was blessed. However, the trials that came in 1943 really caused me to question. One day as I was reading the Bible, I came across four small words that opened my understanding. In 1 Corinthians 4:11 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and buffeted and wander without a home.&rdquo; I was very familiar with this portion of the Bible. However, when I came to the four words <em>until the present hour</em> I received a fresh revelation and realized that I was taking the right way. The apostle said that he was suffering &ldquo;until the present hour.&rdquo; Could I expect less than the apostle? On that day in the winter of 1943, I put an end to my questions. From that day until today, for sixteen years, I have never tested this way again.</p>
