   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BELIEVING IN THE LORD'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The only condition for God's salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Faith is saying that you are willing and that you want it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the faith that the Bible talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, God has accomplished redemption by the death of His Son Jesus Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His work on the cross has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why has it been completed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither do you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only God knows why.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can the blood of the Lord Jesus redeem us from our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is the Lord's redemption effective?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not need to ask these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are matters for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's work on the cross has been accomplished, and God's heart is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross of the Lord Jesus is not for satisfying our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is for satisfying God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Does the settlement of a debt satisfy the heart of the creditor or the heart of the debtor?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God feels that something is sufficient for Him, we also should feel that it is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He says that the Lord's work is able to redeem us from sin, it is surely able to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not you think that the work is sufficient is irrelevant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What matters is that God thinks that the work is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not just a matter of whether or not the money has been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What matters is whether or not the creditor considers the money paid.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the money you pay satisfies his heart, you will have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wish I could repeat this a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work of the Lord Jesus is not to satisfy our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work of the Lord is first for the satisfaction of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is God who demands the judgment on sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is God who requires that sins be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is God who said that without the blood there is no remission of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God were unconcerned, the blood would be unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood is there because God is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God were unconcerned, the cross would be unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the need of the cross because God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has accomplished all the work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, God raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is the proof that God is satisfied with the Lord's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we do not understand how the cross has satisfied God's heart, we know that Jesus of Nazareth has risen from the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Was it the death of Jesus of Nazareth that the apostles went all over the world to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Have you heard such a gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have never heard such a gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They went all over the world only to tell others that Jesus of Nazareth has been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you read the book of Acts, you will see that the apostles did not preach the death of Jesus for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What they told people everywhere is that this man had resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They preached this because the fact of the Lord's resurrection proves that His death has glorified God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus was resurrected because His work had been accepted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His redemption is complete, and we can now be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the Lord's work had not been completed, He would have been left in the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, resurrection is nothing other than the Lord Jesus satisfying God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus has resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles preach this to us as a proof for our faith, calling us to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, salvation has to do with the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, it has to do with the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His death is for the settlement of our debt and the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By this death the problem of our sins is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His resurrection is the proof that His work of death has satisfied God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God considers His work right and proper.</S>
