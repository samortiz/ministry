   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAINS OF GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 28:22 says, And you shall make upon the breastplate twined chains, a work of cords, of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two chains of gold signify Christ s divine nature as the connecting element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In typology gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The chains, no doubt, served the purpose of connecting, joining.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, these two chains of gold typify the divine nature of Christ as the connecting element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 22 through 27 are not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to verse 23, two rings of gold were put upon the two ends of the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These two ends were at the top and were connected to the shoulder-pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then two ribbons, made of linen, not of gold, were attached to the two bottom ends of the breastplate and bound the breastplate to the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, verse 28 says, And they shall bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue, that it may be upon the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate may not come loose from the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 22 mentions the two chains of gold that connected the top ends of the breastplate to the bottom ends of the two shoulder plates.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These chains were made with twined cords of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word twined signifies having passed through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that Christ s divinity, having passed through sufferings, has become the connecting element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there were no twined, golden cords made into chains, there would not be any connecting element.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There would be nothing to join the breastplate to the shoulder plates.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This necessary connecting element is Christ s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ s divine nature is what joins us all together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have pointed out that the word twined signifies having passed through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ in His divine nature certainly has been twined; that is, He has gone through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, the divine nature within Him was twined.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It passed through a great deal of suffering, a great deal of twining work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>RINGS OF GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 23 says, And you shall make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and put the two rings upon the two ends of the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The two rings of gold on the two ends of the breastplate signify the Spirit of Christ as the holding element.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In typology rings signify the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we have the chains signifying Christ s divinity, and the rings signifying Christ s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps you are wondering what is the difference between Christ s divinity and Christ s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although they are very close, there is nevertheless some difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ has divinity, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also has His Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 8 speaks of Christ and also of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although it is correct to say that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, there is still a difference between Christ and the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, it is difficult for us to explain what this difference is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the picture of the ephod we have the chains and the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we had the chains without the rings, we could not have a complete connection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The chains were the connecting element, but the rings were the holding element.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we have both the connecting and holding elements, we have the proper joining.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you consider your experience carefully in a fine, detailed way, you will realize that, on the one hand, the divine nature of Christ within you is a connecting element and that, on the other hand, the Spirit of Christ within you is a holding element.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we have both Christ s divinity and Christ s Spirit, we have a complete joining.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 24 goes on to say, And you shall put the two cords of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The two chains of gold put on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate signify Christ s divine nature with Christ s Spirit as the connecting power.</S>
