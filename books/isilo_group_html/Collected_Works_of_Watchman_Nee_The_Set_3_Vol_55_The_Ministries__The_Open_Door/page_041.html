None of us can choose freely. In this way the church will preach the gospel. Every person, no matter where he goes, must go for the gospel. Their mouth must be for the preaching of the gospel. We need to go out as the Body. I believe that the Lord will have His way today.</p><p>If we are not trustworthy and faithful, the Lord will choose others to take this way. I believe that it is possible for Him to do this, but it would take at least another twenty years. Do not say that the Lord will not lay us aside. The Lord can easily lay us aside, but it would waste another twenty years. We expect to save twenty years for the Lord. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may catch up. Let us give our all for this. After passing through very burdensome and difficult experiences, He has shown us this way. May we not forsake it.</p><p>A message given by Watchman Nee and recorded by Brother Chou on the morning of August 19, 1948.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE REAL CONDITION OF THE SELF<br />UNDER GOD'S LIGHT</h2><p>The days seem to have flown by, and I have been at Kuling for three weeks now. If the start of school is not delayed, I will return to Shanghai around the beginning of September. I will only be able to stay for two or three more weeks at the most. My heart is filled with fear and trepidation; I really do not know how I will live in the coming days! In the light of the Lord's word&mdash;although I have really understood only a very small portion&mdash;I deeply feel that I cannot continue to live in the darkness of my previous days. Oh, I had not even dreamed that my previous days and previous "work" were this way. In today's light, almost every matter, word, and attitude were merely the hypocrisy of pride, even though others saw them as "restrained," "spiritual," "humble," and "learned." Oh! Even my bones are haughty. It is not enough to say that my previous "work" was full of man's hands, ways, and thoughts; I do not know how much would remain if all the elements of human lust were removed.</p><p>During the past months, almost everything has worked to expose me; I realize that I am intensely proud to the very core of my being. Yet I was in such darkness that I had no feeling of this. Although I discovered my pride many times, sought humility, and tried my best to learn to be humble, little did I realize that this "humility" was no purer and better than my pride. I really have no way to describe the depth of my pride! I am proud when doing something and proud when I am still. The Lord seems to have brought all of my former conduct to the light. He has shown me the source of all matters and activities and the depth of my evil. He also has shown me the leading of His hand through my circumstances. He has exposed my dark, insensitive condition!</p><p>My deepest parts are full of sorrow and repentance. I look to the Lord to give me grace and to have pity on me, His lazy and evil servant. May He break and smash my pride! I feel that I am unable to continue in my old way, nor can I continue in my old work! My hazy future fills me with fear and trembling! May the Lord give you a burden to pray for me. May the Lord thoroughly break me and touch me.</p><p>A sophomore at Nanking Central University Medical College<br />August 15, 1948</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
