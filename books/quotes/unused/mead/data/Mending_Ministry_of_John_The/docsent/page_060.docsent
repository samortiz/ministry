   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the opening verses of chapter four we can see the subject of these intervening chapters.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His rulership, then, matches His priesthood to bring the churches into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the main point of these seventeen chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While He is administrating God's government over the whole universe by arranging events on earth, He is also carrying out His heavenly ministry.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet among these there are some who love Him more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These ones especially need the care of the ascended Christ to minister the heavenly supply to them while they are overcoming everything that would hold them back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They overcome sin, the world, Satan, the self, the flesh, their lusts, even everything of the old creation, especially including religion.</S>
