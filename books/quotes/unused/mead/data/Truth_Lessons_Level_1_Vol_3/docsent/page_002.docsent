   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Beginning with this lesson we enter into another section of the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will use twenty-four lessons to focus on the initial stage of God s full salvation, the stage of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this first lesson we will see the condition of man after Adam s fall and before man receives God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s condition reveals his need for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the fall and before receiving salvation, man s condition before God, in himself, and under Satan s hand is exceedingly pitiful and tragic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I. THE CONDITION BEFORE GOD A. Having Sinned</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first condition of man before God is that man has sinned and is sinful Rom 3:23, 10-12; 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sinfulness of man before God is in two aspects: positional and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Positionally speaking, because men are descendants of Adam, who was the head of the human race and who represented all mankind, when Adam sinned, men were brought into a sinful position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, because Adam was the forefather of mankind, out of whom came the whole human race Acts 17:26a , he not only represented but also included the whole human race when he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, when he sinned, all the descendants who would be born of him sinned together with him and in him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through one person s sinning, all the descendants of this one committed sin in him cf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Heb 7:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Men are sinful before God also from the standpoint of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who has never sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who has clean hands and a pure heart and has no experience of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can avoid lying, stealing, coveting, and filthy thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because men are in a sinful position, they fall into sinful experiences; these sinful experiences of men prove that men are in a sinful position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, whether in position or in experience, man is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>B. Being under God s Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>and Condemnation</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because men have sinned, they are under the judgment of God Rom 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is righteous, and He is the One who established the law; but men are sinful and commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, according to God s righteousness and God s law, God must judge sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, God s righteousness and God s law have subjected all the world to the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today men are not only under God s judgment, but they have been condemned already before God John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether they know it or not, whether they sense it or not, men have been condemned already before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>People do not need to wait to be judged and then condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They were condemned before God long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Adam sinned and was condemned by God, all men were condemned in him through his one offense Rom 5:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today all men are already condemned sinners at the very moment of their birth.</S>
