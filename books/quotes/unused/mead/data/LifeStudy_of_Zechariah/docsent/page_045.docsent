   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Children of Israel Being Left</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to the Foolish and Worthless Shepherds</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The priests, the elders, and the scribes were all annulled, and Jesus was crucified, rejected to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The children of Israel were therefore left to the foolish and worthless shepherds, who would not take care of them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that after the crucifixion of Christ, there was no proper leadership among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They fought with one another, devouring one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The foolish, worthless shepherds who rose up among them caused them further suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of situation allowed Titus to come in to devastate the entire country of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This chapter surely refers to Israel's living under the tyranny of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus Himself lived under the reign of the Roman rulers; He lived under the reign of Caesar, the highest ruler, and also under the reign of Herod and Pilate, who were subordinate rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Under this reign, He, the real and proper Shepherd, was detested, rejected, attacked, sold, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning this, Matthew 26:31, a quotation of Zechariah 13:7, says, "I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ, the Shepherd, was put to the cross, all the sheep of His flock were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapters nine through eleven of Zechariah unveil Christ in a very intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The center of the prophecies in these chapters is Christ as the rejected Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter nine Christ came and entered into Jerusalem as the King in a lowly form.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then chapter ten reveals this kind, intimate, and gentle One as the Shepherd coming in His loving visitation to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He was thirty years of age, He came forth to shepherd the people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the three and a half years of His ministry on earth, He ministered the spiritual supply to God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The time of His ministry was a time of shepherding, and many were helped by His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, because His help became so popular, the elders, scribes, and priests became jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In their jealousy they arrested Jesus through Judas's betrayal of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Following this, He was judged first by the high priest according to God's law and then by the rulers of the Roman government, Herod and Pilate, according to Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus was altogether justified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pilate told the Jews that he could not find anything wrong with Jesus John 18:38; 19:4 , but they would not listen to him, and their voices overcame him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Crucify!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him" John 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of acting justly, Pilate delivered Jesus into the hands of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They then took Jesus and led Him away to a place called Golgotha, and there they crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They rejected their King to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Messiah came in a gentle, intimate way to visit His people Israel as their King.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they had been ready, they would have welcomed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the kingdom of the heavens would have been set up on earth, and the time of restoration would have come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It should have happened in this way, but because of Israel's rejection of Christ, it did not.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we realize this, then we will understand what is revealed concerning Christ in Zechariah 9 11.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>More details regarding Christ are revealed in Zechariah than in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Daniel mainly reveals that Christ is the One who has gone to God to receive power, authority, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Having received the kingdom, He will come to earth as the smiting stone to smash the great human image, that is, to crush human government entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Zechariah intimately unveils Christ as the coming Savior, the coming Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At first, He was welcomed by the people, but later, under the influence of the elders, priests, and scribes, they changed their mind and detested Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus was sold, judged, sentenced, and put on the cross to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the Messiah, who was welcomed temporarily, was utterly rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, the people of Israel were divided, persecuted by the Roman Empire, and scattered throughout the earth.</S>
