   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How do we know that a covenant is reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we tell that a testament is reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that many covenants established by many nations are not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our first need is not to ask what the covenant or a testament has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our first need is to ask if such a covenant or testament is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The cup is the cup of the new covenant, and the blood is in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new covenant is in the blood of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood of the new covenant has a wonderful effect, which is to cleanse sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The direct purpose of the shedding of the Lord Jesus' blood was for the establishing of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How strange it is that one has to shed his blood to establish a covenant!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is a covenant only effective when blood is shed?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I deeply believe that if every Christian knew that the blood of the Lord Jesus established a covenant, we would not be as bound, restricted, and powerless, and we would not receive only a few answers to prayer and few results in our work as we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, we have fallen to such a condition because we have put the new covenant aside.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know the term the new covenant, but we have forgotten its use.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why we have fallen to such a state.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God established a few covenants in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He established a covenant with Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also established a covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He also established a covenant with Jacob, even though it was not called one explicitly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also established a covenant with the Israelites who left Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But there is still another covenant which He enacted through the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are other covenants besides these.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although there are many covenants, the two most important ones are the one made with Abraham and the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the other covenants are less crucial and affect a smaller sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The new covenant follows immediately after the covenant God made with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The new covenant is a further development of the covenant God made with Abraham and inherits what God promised to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The book of Galatians tells us that the covenant God made with Abraham is the proper covenant, while the covenant of the law was only an insertion between two covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only Abraham's covenant of promise and the new covenant are proper covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In between the covenant of promise and the new covenant, another covenant was inserted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the so-called "old covenant," or old testament, which lasted for fifteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The old testament is not the thirty-nine books that we have which span from Genesis to Malachi.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the proper name of these thirty-nine books is the Holy Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The actual time of the old testament begins from Exodus 19 and ends with the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the old testament or covenant, there was the covenant which God made with Abraham from which the new covenant follows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Originally, when man was created, he was well preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of the fall through sin, there was the action of the conscience, and man walked according to his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But two thousand five hundred years after God created the world, man was still sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, God told Moses to enact a covenant the law with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God promised the Israelites that they would be a royal priesthood, a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the condition of the old covenant was bilateral.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why there were two tablets of the law in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one side, the Israelites had to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other side, God would bless them if they kept it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they could not keep God's law, God would punish them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the picture of the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As far as the condition in Eden is concerned, the blood of the Lord Jesus is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As far as the law is concerned, the blood of the Lord Jesus is also necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What was the picture of the exile from Eden?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was a loss of position, inheritance, and a loss of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man had to labor in the sweat of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I always consider sin to be a big minus sign; our body, spiritual life, as well as all that we should have inherited from our Creator were lost because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All these were lost through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was a long period from Adam to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The period from Moses to Christ was also a very long period.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From Adam to Moses, death reigned, while from Moses to Christ, not just death reigned, but death and sin reigned.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sin has been present since Adam, and death has been reigning because the result of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is death?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is the totality of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sin is like small rivers and streams, while death is like the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The general name for the whole period between Adam and Moses is death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Exile, curses, laboring in birth, thorns, pain, and sweat, all point to death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of these things signify death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The end of these things is death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Death is like the sea into which all the streams and rivers feed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what we lost in Eden through Adam, and this is what we gained through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We did not lose just a few things; we lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Two thousand five hundred years later, Moses received the covenant of the law from God on Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The covenant said that if man kept the words of the covenant, God would bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, if he could not keep the words of the covenant, God would punish him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What has the law added to us?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It has added nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Is it an addition?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No. This is why death reigned from Adam to Moses, while both death and sin reigned from Moses to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Previously, there was just death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There was sin in addition to death.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The law did nothing except expose sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was indeed a big minus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Not only was there no blessing, but there was sin and curse as well.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before Christ came, man had incurred two great losses.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The first loss was through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The second loss was through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>These losses have kept man from receiving answers to prayers and have caused man to fail and not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Man was estranged and kept from the enjoyment of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Man became foolish and ignorant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He became weak and unable to enjoy the power of God toward his body and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Man was deprived of all things pertaining to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How was the death that was present in the time between Adam and Moses removed?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How was the sin that was present in the time between Moses and Christ removed?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today, the blood is the answer to these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some have said that the cross is a big plus sign.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Although this is man's saying, it is nevertheless true.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The cross of God has added everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>From Adam to Moses, all we had was death, and from Moses to Christ, all we had was sin.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now the blood of Christ has terminated everything of Adam, including death, and has terminated everything after Moses that was condemned as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Now all our failures before God are removed and nothing is left.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Through the shedding of the Lord's blood, we do not have to die anymore, and our sins are cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Originally God was for us, and everything that God had was ours.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We were separated from God because of sin and, subsequently, death.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God could not help us anymore, and His intended blessings and grace were barred from us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Although we can say that through sin we gained death, what actually happened was that through sin, we lost everything that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We lost everything that God had given, can give, and will give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The blood apparently only does a direct work of cleansing us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But actually, the blood recovers our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Now what God has given, can give, and will give to us can come to us once more in an unhindered way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The blood adds God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The blood of Christ not only accomplished redemption, but accomplished an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Unlike the blood of bulls and goats which only accomplished a temporary redemption, the blood of Christ was shed only once and it accomplished an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The blood of Christ is not like the blood of bulls and goats which men in the Old Testament trusted in. The blood of Christ was shed once.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Now sin is gone forever, and the conscience no longer condemns us of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is what the blood of Christ has done.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It has completely solved, once for all, the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Because the problem of sin is solved, God is added to us.</S>
