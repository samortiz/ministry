   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOSPEL BEING NOT ONLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR MAN TO BELIEVE BUT ALSO FOR MAN TO SUBMIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible speaks not only of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It also speaks of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not only sinners; we are sons of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Romans 10:16 we have the obedience to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In principle believing in the gospel is obeying the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Thessalonians 1:8 says, "Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who do not obey are those who rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 2:8 speaks of those who are disobedient to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is also rebellion, and God will render wrath and anger to those who rebel against the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Peter 1:22 says, "Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth..."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By this we see that salvation comes through obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To believe is to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A disciple in faith should really be a disciple in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only must there be the faith; there must also be the submission to the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Paul was enlightened, he said, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He not only believed in the Lord; he became obedient to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's conversion not only made him realize grace, but also made him submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he was moved by the Holy Spirit to see the authority of the gospel, he acknowledged Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has called us not only to receive life through faith, but also to maintain His authority through obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's plan for us in the church is for us to submit to His authority and to all the authorities He has established.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This covers our home, our government, our school, the church, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He does not want to specifically mark out whom we should submit to.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we have met God's authority in the Lord, we should learn to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many can submit and be obedient if they are under certain ones, but to others they cannot submit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is due to a failure in seeing authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is useless to submit to man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is needed is to see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All kinds of systems are for us to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After a man has touched authority, a slight disobedience will cause him to have an inward sense of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who do not know authority do not realize how rebellious they are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before Paul was enlightened, he did not know that he was kicking against the goads 26:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After a man is enlightened, he will first see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he will see many authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Paul met a little brother, Ananias, he did not see just a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not ask who Ananias was or whether or not he was educated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He recognized Ananias as a sent authority, a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, Paul submitted to him 9:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How easy it is to submit when one has met authority!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>GOD DESIRES TO MAKE THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE KINGDOM OF GOD THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the church does not take God's authority, He has no way to establish His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, God gained the kingdom in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He established His kingdom in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the end His kingdom will be established on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day there will be a declaration, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ" Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Between the time in which the kingdom was in the Lord Jesus individually and the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only when the kingdom was established in the Lord Jesus could it be established in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only when the kingdom is established in the church can the kingdom of the world become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without the Lord Jesus, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without the church, there is no expansion of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the Lord was on earth, He was obedient even in the smallest thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, He was not negligent in the matter of paying the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even when there was no money, a coin was found in the mouth of a fish to pay it Matt 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He also said, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although Caesar was rebellious, he was set up by God, and as such, one must obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When our obedience is perfect, the Lord will rebuke the disobedient ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we become submissive, the kingdom can be expanded to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many have strong feelings concerning sin, but they have no feeling concerning rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man must not only have the consciousness of sin; he must also have the consciousness of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Without the consciousness of sin, one cannot be a disciple of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without the consciousness of authority, one cannot be a disciple of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>THE CHURCH MUST SUBMIT TO GOD'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to know how to submit in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is not a single authority in the church that we can ignore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God wants to see the kingdom issuing forth from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He wants all authority to be executed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the church is so submissive, the earth will submit to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the church will not give the kingdom of God a free way, the kingdom of God will have no way among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For this reason, the church is the highway to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If this is not the case, the church will become a hindrance to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today if the church cannot submit to God because of a little difficulty, how can the kingdom of God be manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When men reason with one another and argue with one another, how can God's kingdom come?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have delayed God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must rid ourselves of all disobedience so that God will have a free way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When the church submits, the nations will submit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For this reason, the church bears a great and heavy responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When God's life, God's will, and God's commands are executed in the church, the kingdom will come.</S>
