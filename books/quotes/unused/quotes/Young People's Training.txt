They all were religious people who had a background in the Scriptures in the worship of God in Gods law and in the general knowledge of God
The fact that the Lord took His disciples there strongly implies and indicates that He is absolutely different from the typical religion
The revelation of Christ as the Son of the living God was not given in the sphere, in the realm, of the Jewish religion
The Lord brought the disciples away from everything 'holy'-away from the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple
With this as the background, Peter answered the Lord's question by saying, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God'
It did not derive from the Jewish religion, the holy temple, or the holy city, but was something fresh and new
Christ and the church will bring in the kingdom of God and will cast down and defeat the gates of Hades, the authority of Satan
The vision that Christ and the church will bring in God's kingdom and defeat the kingdom of Satan is given outside of religion
In the Jewish religion there was a young man named Saul who had a strong will and who was faithful to that traditional religion
While he was on the way to damage the church, doing his best to persecute it, the Lord Jesus appeared to him and knocked him to the ground
Saul was zealous for God according to the traditional religion, but he was persecuting the church of Christ and opposing God's economy
Although he was so zealous for God, he did not realize that he was part of the greatest deviation from the central line of God's revelation
The Lord said that He would reveal other things to Saul, not in the way of teaching, but by means of His appearing
After you have seen the vision, you need to contact people, telling them that Jesus has appeared to you and that you have seen Him
By turning in this way, they will be released from the evil power of darkness, which is the authority of Satan, unto God
Those who turn from Satan to God will not have a portion individually but corporately and collectively with all the saints
We cannot have such a portion alone; we can only have it among the saints, among those who are sanctified by faith
Day by day, we enjoy Christ as our portion, not in an individualistic way, but by enjoying Him among the saints
Lord, You appeared to Paul and he saw something, and You told him that You would show him more through Your appearing to him
If the one farthest away from Christ could receive the revelation of Jesus Christ, then why could we not receive it also?
Lord, cause us all to experience the riches of the unlimited Christ and to have the church life which comes out of this enjoyment'
If you will pray-read all these verses and live in them and witness according to them, the issue will be the local churches
Today, Christ is realized as the Spirit, but some are fighting against this, saying that it is heresy to teach that Christ is the Spirit
While most Christians care for the universal church, they insist on perpetuating the denominations and free groups
Today, Christ is not only sitting at the right hand of God in the heavens; as the life-giving Spirit, He also dwells in our spirit
Eventually, according to the New Testament, as far as our inner being is concerned, Christ will become one with us
After He became flesh and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, He died on the cross, shed His blood, and was buried
We know how the Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh
From henceforth the Spirit just as He was the personal Divine life, could also become the personal life of men
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man-most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man
Others, however, may experience Him as a goat, and still others experience Christ as a huge bullock like the apostle Paul did
As you contact other young people on the campuses, you must be those who live by Christ and experience Him day by day
If you would experience Him as the One making His home in your heart, you must pray to see the vision that Christ today is the Spirit
He is God, the Creator, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Lord, the light, the life, etc
Christ is our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption, our love, our patience, our endurance
The fellowship of Christ into which it entered, when it turned to the Lord, was in truth the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Such a virtual identification of Christ and the Spirit can have reference only to Christ in His state of exaltation
Where the possession of the Spirit of Christ is clearly regarded as tantamount to an indwelling of Christ Himself
The Spirit alone searches the depths of God and where the Spirit is silent as to their contents it is hazardous and indeed vain to speculate
Our only need is to give ourselves to Him, to love Him, to live by Him, and to take Him as our life, our person, and our everything
If you are a husband and are about to speak to your wife, you must be sure that in your speaking you take Christ as life
Because of religion, people have selected various points found in the Bible and have passed them on as doctrines in their books
Although it is difficult to say what the spirit is, you do know quite well what your mind, emotion, and will are
If you are a married brother and are about to talk with your wife, examine whether or not you are in the mind, emotion, or will
If you are in none of these places, then you must be in your spirit and you can freely converse with your wife
There are only four chambers of your being in which you can dwell the chambers of the mind emotion will and the inner chamber of the spirit
God dispenses Himself into us as everything for the purpose of gaining His corporate expression, which is the church
The experience of Christ is somewhat hidden and mysterious, but the practice of the church life is quite complicated
The so-called Catholic charismatic movement even tolerates the worship of Mary, exposing the impurity of that movement
Some denominations are larger and others are smaller, some are farther away and some are closer, but none of them is in the center lane
If we stand for doctrines, we shall be divided immediately, for one will have his concept, another his opinion, and still another his view
When we take Christ as our life, as our person, and as our everything, this Christ within us will require the proper church life
Eighteen years ago, some young learners under my training in Taiwan were influenced by a certain ministry of spirituality
We had the full assurance that this was not something of the Lord, and after a period of time their number gradually decreased
In Revelation 19:6-9 we are told that the Lamb's Wife has made herself ready and that the marriage supper of the Lamb has come
We must leave religion and get into the Lord's recovery of the full experience of Christ and of the proper practice of the church life
May we all see the vision that the Lord's recovery today concerns the experience of Christ and the practical church life
If we have a heart to mean business with the Lord, then we must have a clear vision concerning Christ and the church
When we speak of a vision concerning Christ, we do not mean Christ in a doctrinal or theological way; we mean Christ in our experience
Only the Christ experienced by us in our worship and service will make our worship and service acceptable to God
If we lack Christ, we may be members of a society or of Christianity, but we cannot be members of the living Body of Christ
Paul does not say that he received grace in order to preach the doctrine of Christ, the theology of Christ, or the teaching of Christ
When we have a little experience of Christ, not in doctrine but in reality, we desire fellowship with other Christians
Many Christians today do not care for the church life because they do not have the real, genuine, and practical experience of Christ
Today you will be in a certain so-called church and, when you are no longer happy with it, you will leave and travel elsewhere
After a time you will leave the second place and begin to wander again, constantly looking for something newer and better
The genuine church life is the expression of the one Body of Christ with the experience of Christ as its content
Formerly, a certain board might have been quite useful, but once the carpenter has worked on it, making it part of a door post, it is wasted
They have this concept in their minds, but it is not fully, actually, and thoroughly practiced in their life and work
The most crucial and central point in the New Testament is that Christ, as the embodiment of God the Father, is now in our spirit
According to the Greek, the word 'walk' means to live, to do things, to behave ourselves, and to have our being
Week after week, people listen to messages, but they never hear a message telling them to live and have their being according to the spirit
If you consult the people on the street, you will find that they do not have a spirit regenerated and indwelt by Christ
He was a person absolutely living, walking, behaving himself, having his being, and working for the Lord in the spirit
When others said that they did not understand what they were talking about, the brothers replied, 'Turn from your mind to your spirit'
According to 1 Corinthians 5:3-5, Paul could even attend a church meeting in his spirit when he was not physically present
In 1 Corinthians 5:4 he said, 'In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit'
In his spirit he could exercise authority in the name of the Lord Jesus to execute the Lord's judgment upon a sinful brother
Whenever we are in our mind, we are in one kingdom, but whenever we turn to our spirit, we are in another kingdom
We must be burning, zealous, boiling, and aggressive, not in our emotions or in our natural being, but in our spirit
We have a heavy burden and the clear understanding that the Lord desires to accomplish His recovery in this age
The Lord's up-to-date economy is to gain young people, not only in this country but in all the leading countries for His recovery
You must look to the Lord for the wisdom how to help him to be stirred up to love the Lord, to be constrained by the love of Christ
If our spirit is constantly living and has a living consciousness and intuition, we shall have the wisdom we need
Why did not the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John charge His disciples to preach the gospel or to teach the nations?
We do not use the word 'dispensation' in the sense of an age, but with the meaning of economy, referring to God's dispensing administration
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Lord Jesus indicated here that when the Spirit of reality comes, He would not only be with the disciples but also in them
No matter what our mind thinks, our emotion says, or our will determines, we simply cannot get rid of the sense deep within us
In John 151 the Lord said I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman and in John 155 He said I am the vine you are the branches
When people went to visit him, after speaking with them for a while, he excused himself, picked up his pipe, and smoked
While some may preach and still be able to smoke or attend the movies, genuine gospel preaching is the overflow of the inner life
You may preach and teach, but if you do not abide in the Lord, you will never bear fruit by the overflow of the inner life
As you contact people on the campuses, you must have the deep sense and the full realization that you are abiding in the Lord
When we are stirred up and burning, we take the thought that after a short time we shall bring many to the Lord
In chapter three Nicodemus came all the way to the Lord, and in chapter four the Lord Jesus met the Samaritan woman midway
Without entering into a person's situation, you cannot touch his heart and feeling, and he will never respond to you
The Lord Jesus said Whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you and Ask whatever you will and it shall come to pass to you
In this way, you will learn together and, after a year, some of you will become very experienced in reaching people
Although we may still need this power, the proper and normal preaching of the gospel is by the overflow of life
The Lord Jesus had two kinds of sufferings: the suffering for redemption and the suffering for producing and building the Body, the church
In typology, on the day of atonement, only the high priest, who made atonement for the people, was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies
Immediately after his conversion he began to share in this suffering of Christ partaking of the suffering of Christ for the sake of His Body
Here is a word telling us that at least one thing related to Christ is lacking-His suffering for the producing and building up of His Body
Because this suffering has not been completed by Christ Himself, there is the need for His faithful ones to make up this shortage
If the mercy of the Lord made Paul a pattern, then His mercy can accomplish in us the same thing that it did in Paul
We were always asked to consider God's love, pity, and sympathy for the pitiful sinners, and were told to have the same feeling toward them
Some would be inspired by this preaching and, with tears, respond to the altar call to become preachers and ministers of the gospel
If you only preach the gospel for the sake of winning souls and rescuing people from hell, you probably will not suffer very much
In the book of Acts we see that those in the Jewish synagogues accused the apostle Paul of being a 'pestilent fellow'
The Lord Jesus had annulled the Sabbath day, but Paul was bold to annul something more important to Judaism-circumcision
According to the record in Acts, the Jews condemned Paul for teaching people to discontinue the practice of circumcision
Although the translation 'dispensation' is correct, its meaning has been ruined, for it is commonly understood to refer to a certain age
The word of God preached in His gospel is not about escaping hell and going to heaven; neither is it about peace, joy, and a happy life
Our critics say that Christ is only a person sitting on the throne in the heavens and that the Holy Spirit comes into us to represent Him
Who is heretical-those, like us, who believe the Bible according to the clear black and white letters, or those who twist the Word of God?
Christ possesses a physical body of bones and flesh, but He came into the closed room where His disciples were
From the side of Luke 24, which we fully believe, the resurrected Christ possesses a physical body of bones and flesh
If they take away anything, they will miss the blessing, and if they add anything, they will receive the curse
In order to complete the word of God we must emphasize the crucial matter that Christ is the life-giving Spirit
You must help them, through the study of typology, to see the holy ointment which is a compound of various spices
Many have criticized us for using the word 'mingle,' saying, 'How could God lose His nature and be mingled with our nature'?
When you contact people, do not preach to them; instead, reach them by getting into their situation, circumstances, and condition
When a 'patient' comes to you, you must exercise your discernment to know what medicine is suitable for his condition
If we see that the Lord's desire is to have a living testimony, then we shall not expect to see people saved so quickly
Although this is a large number, when we are in a certain situation, we realize that we do not have a proper hymn to meet it
If your revelation and learning in the Lord are rich, you will be able to afford people help in any kind of situation
If you have this learning and revelation, you will know the proper time to give the supply to the one on whom you are working
Satan, the devil, the subtle enemy of God, instigates religious people to oppose us, attack us, and spread rumors against us
They say that Witness Lee teaches that the Son is the Father and the Spirit and that this teaching is modalism
A definition of modalism is found in our booklet entitled Modalism Tritheism or the Pure Revelation of the Triune God According to the Bible
Although many so-called fundamental Christians would not dare say this openly, within them they hold the concept of three Gods
The pure revelation of the Triune God occupies a central position between the extremes of modalism and tritheism
In Catholicism, there is the great heresy which says that the virgin Mary is the mother of God and that we must worship her
There is some scriptural ground for claiming that Mary is the mother of God because the Lord Jesus, who is God, was born of her
It is scriptural to say that Mary is the mother of Jesus, but it is heretical to say that she is the mother of God
The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying the twofoldness of the truth of the Trinity
The Bible, true to the principle of balance in God's creation, is balanced and in the center; it does not go to an extreme
Any healthy mind would understand that the mighty God must refer to the child and that the everlasting Father must refer to the Son
The Holy Spirit says that the child is called the mighty God and that the Son is called the everlasting Father
God's being God to us is mainly a matter of His creation, but His being the Father to us is mainly in regeneration
Praise the Lord that we are not merely creatures of the creating God, but also children born of the begetting Father!
As you believe that the child is the mighty God, do you also believe that, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Father?
Can you honestly say that Witness Lee is a heretic when he points out that, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Father?
His name shall be called the Wonderful Counsellor, the Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father'
We need to put out a booklet entitled, 'What Heresy-Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods'!
Isaiah 9:6 is confirmed and strengthened by John 14:7-11, where the Lord makes it clear to the disciples that He and the Father are one
Because Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection, He is now the life-giving Spirit
Praise the Lord that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul had the wisdom to say that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
The opposers' not believing that Christ today is the Holy Spirit implies that, for them, there are two life-giving Spirits
Many unconsciously believe that there are two divine Fathers and two life-giving Spirits, and some, although not all, have three Gods
John 2:23 says, 'Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also'
Our answer is that we believe it more than our critics do, for we believe the Bible according to the pure word
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all'
Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time
Rather, it claims that the revelation of the Son ended with the ascension and that after the ascension the Son ceased to exist
Modalism has gone too far, not believing in the co-inherence and co-existence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Isaiah 96 says that the Father is eternal Hebrews 112 and 73 indicate that the Son is eternal and Hebrews 914 speaks of the eternal Spirit
If you cannot even figure out your inward parts, how do you expect to figure out the infinite, marvelous, wonderful Triune God?
Augustine was accused of being a modalist because he was unable to find human language to adequately express the mystery of the Triune God
Our Greek friends have spoken of one essence, three substances, but the Latins have one essence or substance, three Persons
The terms such as substance, essence, subsistence, and person were all invented for/or adapted to theological usage
These terms are used because, as Griffith Thomas says, we do not have language adequate to explain the mystery of the Trinity
On one page, this article says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate and distinct persons in the nature of one God
Toward the end of the article, it says that these three persons should not be made so separate that They become three Gods
Those who neglect the Scripture and approach such questions with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God not His pupils
According to our experience, if we have the Son we have the Father, and if we call on the name of the Lord, we receive the Spirit
Many only care for traditional knowledge and doctrine, not for their experience or for the pure word of the Bible
It is not merely a matter of knowing God or of speaking about God; it is absolutely a matter of abiding in Him
Man can abide in the divine Being, the creature can abide in the Creator and, in turn, the Creator can abide in the creature
John 220 says that we have an anointing from the Holy One and 1 John 227 says The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you
Why does the First Epistle of John, which speaks of our abiding in God and God's abiding in us, use the word anointing in chapter two?
Both the cinnamon and the calamus, however, are two hundred and fifty shekels in amount, and cassia, like myrrh, is five hundred shekels
If the flavor of the Lords death is not added to our living our conversation with our wives or with the brothers and sisters will be bitter
In whatever we do and say in our daily living, we must have the flavor of the Lord's death and the sweetness of His resurrection added to it
The Holy Spirit today is not the mere single Spirit; He is now a compound of divinity and other elements compounded together as one unit
The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning , but the compounded Spirit 'was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified'
Recall that the measures of the cinnamon and the calamus denote the splitting of the second of the Triune God on the cross
Thank the Lord that through the past fifty years He has not only shown us many things, but He has also caused us to experience them
The Lord said that it was better to say that the effectiveness of the Lord's death is included in the Holy Spirit
Take all the points home with you, pray, fellowship with others, and seek the Lord's leading how to contact them again
Do not fight with them, but maintain the good attitude of a learner, of one who wants to study the pure revelation in the Bible
As they consider the pure revelation concerning the Triune God, they may lose their peace and sense the need to reconsider their belief
During the past years in the United States, the attacks have always been on two points- the Spirit and the ground of the church
The enemy has tried his best to defeat us regarding the Spirit for our experience and the church ground for our practice
Galatians 1:22 and 1 Thessalonians 2:14 both speak of 'the churches in Judaea,' that is, the churches in the Jewish territory of Judaea
God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches
Most Christians do not dare say that the church is in the Roman Catholic Church or in any of the denominations
Many, finding it difficult to answer this question, may reply, 'The church is heavenly and spiritual, and all Christians are in it'
Finding it difficult to answer my question in a definite way, many have said, 'Brother Lee, the church is heavenly and spiritual
In Christianity there is a great deal of vain talk, especially regarding the church, but little of this talk is practical
According to the revelation of the New Testament, the church, the Body of Christ, is expressed in the local churches
God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches
In Revelation 1:11 we read of seven local churches in seven cities: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea
Of giving us teaching regarding the church, the Bible gives us illustrations of seven local churches in seven specific cities
God's intention is to produce the church through Christ and to have it experienced in a practical way and expressed in the local churches
Following this, in Acts, the church is mentioned in relation to a locality, for example, the church at Jerusalem and the church at Antioch
Acts 14:23 says that the apostles ordained elders in every church, and Titus 1:5 says that elders were ordained in every city
As we have already pointed out, in the last book of the Bible the churches are mentioned in relation to localities
The church in the universe is one, but this church must be expressed practically on earth in the localities where the saints are
It seems that the gambling city of Las Vegas wanted to have the reputation of being a city filled with 'churches'
Whenever a man is related to a woman apart from the restriction of God's governing principle, that is fornication
If her position is that of a concubine, no matter how good she is, she is not the wife because she does not have the position of the wife
The first woman, although she does not possess the virtues of the others, would be recognized as the true wife
We have the complete assurance that what we are doing here is of the Lord and that this is the Lord's recovery
If you encounter criticisms that you cannot answer, refer them to the elders, and we shall deal with these criticisms together
Perhaps at some time the Lord will give you the opportunity to help that one come to a proper understanding of what heresy is
If you consult a dictionary, you will discover that heresy is an anglicized Greek word-a Greek word brought over into the English language
To know what heresy is, we must go to the New Testament and understand the meaning and usage of this word in the Greek language
A small number from the Jewish religion followed Jesus to form another group which was considered by others as a sect
Paul uses the word hairesis strongly in Galatians 520 ranking heresy with works of the flesh such as adultery fornication and witchcraft
Immediately before speaking of heresies, Paul mentions 'hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions'
To have a school of opinion means to hold an opinion that causes you to be separated and divided from others and to form into a sect
We say that Christ is the Father and the Spirit because of Isaiah 9:6, 1 Corinthians 15:45, and 2 Corinthians 3:17
Although others may not agree with us, nevertheless it is not fair to condemn us for believing what the Bible says
The difference between us and others is not a matter of heresy, but of different interpretations, of different opinions
When the moon appears in Taipei, it is called 'the moon in Taipei,' and when the moon appears over Paris, it is called 'the moon in Paris'
To make the words 'local church' a title is to turn us into a local church sect and to cause us to become a local church denomination
When people ask you to share with them about the church, patiently explain to them that we have no title whatever
In this message and in the messages following we turn to the matter of the reality and practicality of the church
We are not concerned with the church in doctrine or merely with the church in revelation, but with the church in reality and practicality
In order to see the reality and practicality of the church, we must have a clear revelation concerning the church
When many people hear the word 'church,' they think of a cathedral or of a bungalow with a high tower and a bell
Before we do this, we need to have some fellowship regarding the fact that the church is according to the desire of God's heart
If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it?
If, after you have been saved, you have only improved your behavior and become deep in life, you are just useful for some kind of exhibition
If you do so, you will see what a strong emphasis there is in God's divine revelation on this matter of the church
Although they did not have the doctrine of the church and perhaps did not even have the word 'church,' they were the church in their living
God wants a real, actual, and practical church, not a group of people talking about the doctrine of the church
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will'
The sonship to which we, the chosen ones of God, have been predestinated is a blessing in the divine life that we might enjoy the church
On the day of resurrection the only begotten Son of God in the flesh was begotten by the Father to be the firstborn Son of God
Prior to this time, the Son of God was the only begotten Son of God, but in resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God
We are told clearly in the Bible that in the Lords resurrection not only He Himself was begotten but that all of Gods chosen ones were born
The words 'many sons' are found in Hebrews 2:10, which indicates that the Father is 'leading many sons into glory'
The church is a corporate entity issuing out of the source of God the Father and having the nature of God the Father
If others attempt to cheat you, simply smile at them and say, 'Dear one, you simply don't know what you are talking about
Are we being constituted with the divine nature, or are we still in our Chinese, Japanese, or American nature?
When you hear that the sonship of the divine nature is the church, you may reply, 'How can we be such a being'?
If you consider the human situation, you will see that mankind does not depend upon individuals, but upon the family
If we say that we are the church, then we must examine ourselves to see whether we are God's house, God's dwelling
Without the Head, you would have something similar to the Body, but it would not be the Body-it would be a corpse
If we say that we are the church, then we must realize three things concerning the Body: headship, life, and function
Many Christians are talking about the church as the Body, but they are sick, not living by the life of the Body
To say that we are the church, the Body of Christ, means that we live by the life of the Body, which is Christ Himself
You should not fellowship with that brother or deal with him by your own natural life, but by the life in the Body
When they come to the meetings, they sit there under the influence of Christianity, expecting some hired ones to function for them
Corinthians 3:16 says, 'Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you'?
It is not simply a matter of having the manifestations of certain gifts, such as healing and speaking in tongues
All the aspects of the church we have covered-sonship, family, Body, counterpart, temple, and army-are corporate entities
With respect to the Father, to the Son, to the Spirit, to the enemy, and for our living, the church is a corporate entity
Hallelujah, the church is the sonship, the family, the Body, the counterpart, the temple, the army, and the one new man!
Matthew 2819 says Go ye therefore and disciple all nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The Lord had a purpose in charging His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them into the Triune God
His death was the termination of the old creation, and His resurrection was the germination of the new creation
Their concept of the Lord's words, 'Go ye,' was to go to the mission field to rescue fallen sinners that they may be saved and go to heaven
To baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit means to immerse them into the divine person
To baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is to baptize them into the divine person of the Triune God
Romans 6:3 says, 'Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
When we immerse people into water, we put them into the death of Christ and simultaneously into the person of Christ
We are not immersed into the substance of the Triune God that we may go to heaven or merely that we may be holy or spiritual
The water flows through the wood to carry away the essence of the wood and to replace it with the element of minerals from the water
To be built does not mean to love one another in a natural waythat is to be one not in the Spirit but in the flesh and in the natural life
Oneness means that the pure golden essence of the Triune God is wrought into our being to replace our 'wooden' element
Forget what you have gleaned from your background and what you have understood according to your natural concept
It is difficult to recite or remember these verses because the concept here absolutely transcends our natural understanding
The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature to express the Father in His fullness
To be perfected is to be 'petrified,' transformed, that is, to have your natural essence carried away and replaced by the divine essence
The extent of the reality of the church life we possess depends upon the degree to which we have been perfected into one
My intention in this message is to point out that the Lord builds His church by baptizing people into the person of the Triune God
If we would have genuine building, we must be transformed by the divine person and even with the divine person
Although we remain human, we have been transformed into the divine Being, for the divine Being has been wrought into us
Because the mineral essence has been wrought into the wood to replace the wooden essence, the wood eventually becomes a stone
Eventually, because the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, we can say that the one Body is one with the Spirit
If not today, then at least in eternity, all the denominational names, which denote divisions, will be eliminated
Today's church life is the Body, and tomorrow's glory with the divine inheritance in the New Jerusalem is the hope of this Body
In many instances the Greek words translated believe in should be rendered believe into according to the meaning of the Greek preposition
We had our first birth by being born of our parents, and we have our second birth by the faith through which we believe into the Lord
The reality of the church is the divine person being wrought into us until we are wholly saturated and permeated with His divine essence
Along with the term, 'the unsearchable riches of Christ,' the book of Ephesians mentions, 'the fulness of him that filleth all in all'
The riches of Christ are all the items of what Christ is-life, light, holiness, righteousness, and many other items
As an American man consumes so many chickens, eggs, apples, and grapefruit, he becomes the composition of all these riches
If you get into all the details of things such as frogs, locusts, and horns found in the book of Revelation, you will be lost
The length of this city is the same as the breadth, for 'the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal'
At the end of the Bible, as the result of God's dispensing Himself into man, we have a city which has replaced the garden
No matter from what direction we approach the city, whether north, south, east, or west, we may immediately be in the flow
Those who come in from South America come in the south gates, and those who come in from Europe come in the west gates
The Brazilians were Brazilians, the Danes were Danes, the Americans were Americans, and the Chinese were Chinese
Although it is wonderful to be in the flow, sometimes we feel like leaping out of the flow, perhaps to get away from certain brothers
In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus said that He would build His church with Peter and others as the stones and with Himself as the rock foundation
In Matthew 18 the Lord indicated that there would be a local church to which we could go to have our problems solved
Corinthians 12:13, which covers both aspects, is a strong proof that baptizing people into the Triune God is the way to build up the church
In these verses the Lord charged the disciples to baptize people into the Triune God and to teach them to observe all that He had commanded
In the following chapters of Acts we see the entering in of these teachings, all of which were like little serpents
Suppose you were in the church flow, and a brother said to you, 'I do not oppose your being in the church flow, but what about circumcision?
In the books of Moses God commanded repeatedly that His people had to be circumcised and He rebuked those who were uncircumcised
Some may say that it is heretical and contrary to the holy Word of God to teach that we should give up circumcision
In the early years, the wind of teaching concerning circumcision blew many dear ones away from the enjoyment of the church flow
The Gnostics seemed to say The teaching of Christ is good but because it is lacking in certain respects there is the need for our philosophy
There is nearly no church flow on earth today because most Christians have been carried away by different teachings
Many of us were in that situation, but the mercy of God reached us, and we saw that what we were in was not the church in the flow
In Ephesians 4:11 and 12 Paul says that the apostles, prophets, and other gifted persons should perfect the saints
Those who have been carried away by these things need to turn to the flow, where they can receive the help to grow in life
These examples of the divisions in the history of the early church will help us see the difference between the church and the denominations
When he was opposing the Lord Jesus and persecuting the church, he surely must have thought that he was serving God
After Ananias said this, 'immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith'
Many Christians today have a heart for the Lord, but they are blind and in darkness; they do not have the heavenly vision
In the past many of us were carried away by various divisive teachings, but by God's mercy we have turned from them
The first verse dealing with the practicality of the church is Matthew 1817 where the Lord Jesus speaks of telling something unto the church
The church mentioned in Matthew 16 becomes practical in Matthew 18, for in Matthew 18 there is a church to which we can go
We have seen that in Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them into the Triune God
As we have pointed out elsewhere, the local churches are the destination of God's revelation and manifestation
Consummately, in the book of Revelation, God is manifested firstly in the local churches and ultimately in the New Jerusalem
If you reject the local church, you lose both the practicality of the church and the destination of God's revelation and manifestation
When we are in Hong Kong, we may speak of the moon in Hong Kong, and when we are in London, we may speak of the moon in London
The church manifested in Anaheim is the church at Anaheim, and the church manifested in Oklahoma City is the church in that city
As long as they bear denominational titles, such as Presbyterian or Baptist, it is difficult for us to be one with them in a practical way
Sadly, however, throughout the centuries not many Christians, even Christian teachers, have paid adequate attention to all these pictures
In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul said, 'Christ our passover is sacrificed for us,' indicating the Passover was a prefigure of Christ
After celebrating the first Passover, the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and entered into the wilderness
The altar, the laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark-all were types of Christ
After the building of the temple, they were divided; and after they were divided, they were dispersed, being held in captivity seventy years
They were not permitted to worship God or to enjoy the offerings they presented to God in any place they liked
Those who lived near Jerusalem undoubtedly were happy to learn of this and they might have said Hallelujah we dont need to travel very far
Those in the north, who had to travel a long way to Jerusalem, might have thought that God was unfair and demanding too much of them
The Passover lamb typifies Christ, the crossing of the Red Sea typifies baptism, and the manna typifies Christ as our food
The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, and all the rich produce of the land is a type of the riches of Christ
You should also be able to testify that the top portion of the riches of Christ can be enjoyed only in the place of His choice
We have seen two important points: the chosen place and the special portion of the produce of the riches of the good land
Throughout the centuries, the children of Israel have not presumed to build a temple for the Lord on any other site
They may have different concepts, opinions, desires, and ambitions, but the site for the building of God's temple is uniquely one
Due to the degradation of Solomon, ten of the twelve tribes were lost to Jeroboam, who established another kingdom
Having made two calves of gold, Jeroboam said, 'Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt'
Just as Jeroboam had God only in name, some of the things that are called 'God' in the worship centers today are simply God in name
Because they want to maintain control over their empire, they do not call themselves by a common term, but by a particular name
You should reply, 'Since there is only one church, why are you here as a 'church' and someone else is over there as another 'church'?
If you bring all these matters to the Lord in prayer, you will clearly see that God has chosen only one ground, the ground of unity
The principle is found in Deuteronomy 12 14 and 16 where God charged His people again and again to care for the unique place chosen by Him
As far as the public worship of God's people is concerned, none of us has the right to select the place of our choice
Deuteronomy 12:8 says, 'Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes'
We have seen that the people of God were degraded, and that furthermore they were scattered due to their degradation
Many of the children of Israel remained in the place of their captivity, unwilling to pay the price to return to Jerusalem
Let us suppose those who remained in Babylon, Egypt, and Syria said, 'You say that you are the temple of God and that we are not
Before we go on to consider the unique place for God's name and for His habitation, we need to review this picture
At the end of the book of Genesis, we are told that Joseph, the representative of the chosen people of God, was put in a coffin in Egypt
The exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt included two things: the Passover and the crossing of the Red Sea
The word Passover indicates that God passed over His people who were under the redeeming blood of the Passover lamb
Although God's people were covered by the blood, they still had to eat the meat of the lamb in order to be strengthened to escape from Egypt
On Satan's side, the side of the evil power signified by Pharaoh and the Egyptian forces, the children of Israel were not allowed to flee
In contrast to the river of water of life, the water of the Red Sea does not appear to be very pleasant or positive
In Gods economy there are two kinds of water the water of the Red Sea and the water of life in the flowing river proceeding from the throne
Although the water of the Red Sea does not quench our thirst, it surely buries the Egyptian army, the evil forces of Satan
The blood of the Passover lamb did not deliver them from this; the blood that covered them delivered them from God's judgment
Although the children of Israel did not like to be in the wilderness, there was nothing they could do about it
Perhaps after dwelling in the good land for a few years, many of the children of Israel remembered the pleasant taste of manna
Deuteronomy 14:22 and 23 say, 'Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year
Thou shalt eat it before the Lord thy God year by year in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou and thy household'
In the previous message we pointed out that the Passover lamb was a type of Christ and that manna was a type of Christ as our food
Christ as our food is not of one category, but of many categories, like the numerous courses of a bountiful feast
The other aspect of the enjoyment of Christ is the enjoyment of the top portion, the choice portion, the firstfruit or firstling, of Christ
Deuteronomy 12:11 says, 'Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there'
In verse 5 God said that He would put His name there, but in verse 11 He says that He will cause His name to dwell there
The common way was to enjoy the common portion of the rich produce of the good land at any time, in any place, and with anybody
The special way was to enjoy the top portion, the firstfruit, and the firstlings in the unique place chosen by God
Using the terms of this message, we may say that we have the common enjoyment of Christ and the special enjoyment of Christ
Although the enjoyment of Christ in the church life is wonderful, it cannot replace our enjoyment of Him in our private life
Although there are thousands of places on earth, there is just one place-the church-where God's name and God's habitation are
Although in some places they may have heard a little regarding the enjoyment of Christ, what they heard was not very satisfying
In Deuteronomy 12:5 the Lord said that He would choose a place out of the tribes of the children of Israel to put His name there
John 14:26 connects the name to the Spirit: 'But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name'
Remember that what is found in the Old Testament is a type and that what is found in the New Testament is the reality
When those in fundamental Christianity come together, they come together with forms, rituals, doctrines, and many other things
Your pastor was in his doctrine, others were in their ritual, and you, with your two critical, observing eyes, were in your mind
The material Jerusalem in the Old Testament was a type of our human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit and mingled with the Holy Spirit
When the Samaritan woman asked about the place of worship, the Lord clearly indicated that the hour has come to worship the Father in spirit
Certainly the enjoyment of Christ is higher and richer in a church of five hundred than in a church of thirty-five
Where the church is, what the church is, and who the church is all depend upon the spirit and the real experience and enjoyment of Christ
We did not come to the church because we were drawn by doctrine, dead letters, or dogma, and we are not held in the church by such things
In the four Gospels the Lord mentioned the church twice, once for the universal aspect and once for the local aspect
It is clearly portrayed in the Bible that the church is universally one in its existence and locally one in its manifestation
Although there is just one universal church, in the many cities there are the many local churches, with one church in each city
If we honor the Lord and sincerely mean business with Him, we would certainly forsake every name other than that of the Lord Jesus
We have been baptized into the unique name, the name above every name, and we have also been called into the fellowship of the Son of God
Whatever term we use, there is something called fellowship, the common participation in Christ, which is common to all believers in Him
Some Christians may not be denominated; that is, they may not have a name for their group, but they do have a particular fellowship
When some who were not members wanted to take communion, the pastor told them they had to wait, pass an examination, and be immersed by them
One man said that he had already been immersed, but the pastor said, 'We don't care how many times you have been immersed
By this we see that the group insisting on the belief in the pre-tribulation rapture does not have just the common faith
If you are not willing to participate in this foot washing, you have no right to join them in their holy communion
Far, we have seen three causes of division-a particular name, a particular fellowship, and a particular teaching
As long as you have either a particular name, a particular fellowship, or a particular teaching, you are a division
For the sake of communication and for registration with the government we may say that we are the church in Anaheim
We tell people that today the Lord Jesus Christ is our life in our spirit and that we must love Him, live by Him, and walk according to Him
Teachings such as foot-washing, head covering, immersion, and pre-tribulation rapture are particular teachings
They declare that they hate any name other than the name of the Lord Jesus and that they do not hold any particular fellowship or teaching
It is easy to see that those with a particular name, a particular fellowship, and a particular teaching are sects
There may be a group that has no particular name, teaching, or fellowship, and whose fellowship is not isolated
Although there were tens of thousands of believers in Jerusalem and although they met in various homes, they had only one set of elders
They have no particular name, fellowship, or teaching, and their fellowship is open to all, to the whole church throughout the world
There may be a Christian group that has no particular name, no particular fellowship, and no particular teaching
The church is a pure golden lampstand, but any group that has a hidden connection with another organization is not pure
Their fellowship was open to all the churches universally, they had one set of elders, and they had no hidden connections
Of these five groups, four are divisions and one, composed of the seventy-five standing as the church in Corinth, is the church
A good answer would be this: 'Brother, if you want to be the church, simply drop your title, and you will immediately become the church
If you find it impossible to drop the title, then leave your divisive circle and return to the proper standing
Although there are thirteen or fourteen million Jews on earth today, less than three million of them are the nation of Israel
The majority were in the 'Pauline church,' the 'Petrine church,' the 'Apollonian church,' or 'the church of Christ'
Thank the Lord that by remaining on the proper standing and by not being in a division, we may be part of the church in our locality
The decision concerning recognizing a church must not be made according to condition, but according to the ground
Throughout the centuries, Satan, the enemy of God, has been doing everything possible to frustrate the building up of the church
Long before Constantine the Great brought Christianity into imperial favor , the church had already been organized into a hierarchy
Many, however, have been drugged in Catholicism, never realizing that in the eyes of God the Catholic Church is the great prostitute
According to the human concept, the beginning of the Lord's recovery was the reformation which started with Martin Luther
Nothing has been more divisive than the Pentecostal movement in the past and the charismatic movement at present
Everyone in this movement is utterly individualistic, and many feel free to set up a Christian meeting in any way they choose
During the past fourteen years we have been presenting by the Lords mercy what He has shown us regarding the genuine oneness of the church
In the Lord's recovery we have delivered message after message on this matter, and today the term 'the local church' is a popular item
Now a number of radio preachers are using this term, and a number of groups are calling themselves a local church
In 1962 a brother in the United States was burdened to publish an American edition of the book entitled, The Normal Christian Church Life
We should not blame this book for these divisions; those who use this book to build their own work should be held responsible for this
By reading Brother Nee's book, they discovered some new concepts to feed their desire, and they began to establish local churches
Some of these were in the charismatic movement and had learned that speaking in tongues was not the way to build up the church
Some who were influenced by Brother Nee's book have said that the practice of the Lord's recovery is too frank and too bold
Those who follow this way claim that they are practicing the church life, but they do not want to call it the church
In 1963 a particular traveling preacher who knew nothing about the Lord's recovery visited my training in Los Angeles
He stayed for some time and learned many things, including the truths of God's eternal purpose and the tree of life
After about three years, he suddenly claimed to see another line in addition to the line of Jerusalem and the line of Antioch
Because the intention of brothers like this is to establish their own work, sooner or later they will cause divisions
Some outside the Lord's recovery have used this book, The Normal Christian Church Life, to begin so-called local churches
Today we live in a dark age of division and confusion, and it is difficult to discern the church from a division
According to the Bible, she bears the name, 'Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes, and the Abominations of the Earth'
Even today, West Germany still has a state church, and all the citizens of that country must pay the church tax
After the rise of the state churches, the independent churches, such as the Presbyterians, Baptists, and the Methodists, came into being
Can the Catholic Church, the state churches, and all the independent churches be truly recognized as churches?
If all these free groups can be recognized as the church, then there must be a countless number of churches in the universe
The Catholic Church, the denominations, the Pentecostal churches, and the free groups all claim to be the church
In addition to the plain words of the New Testament, we should also consider the pictures, the types, in the Old Testament
Although he did not return to Jerusalem, he prayed for God's economy, opening his windows toward Jerusalem three times a day
Although this temple was inferior to the original temple built by Solomon, the site, the ground, of the temple was the same
Throughout the centuries, many have recognized that the site on which this mosque now stands is the site of the temple
The way to discern whether or not a Christian group is a division is to apply the six tests given in the foregoing message
During the past fourteen years, there have been a few among us in the United States who expected to become elders
After going from city to city without being put into the eldership, they eventually turned their back on the church and left
If you feel unhappy when a brother or sister is made a leader, it reveals that your motive has not been purified
In this day of division and confusion you must be on the alert not to be cheated, deceived, or influenced by anyone
The most crucial need among the young people is to learn how to be strong in spirit and rich in the experience of Christ
Whenever you come to the meetings of the church, you must have a strong spirit and you must be rich in the experience of Christ
As we have pointed out, in ancient times God's people were commanded to do two things in their public worship of God
Not only should we come in our spirit; we must come with our hands full of Christ, full of the rich produce of the good land
Young people, you must be clear about four matters: the church, the way to contact people, the spirit, and the experience of Christ
