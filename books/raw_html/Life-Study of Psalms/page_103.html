<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Tasting and Seeing That God Is Good</H2><P>Psalm 34:8 says, "Taste and see that Jehovah is good." I did not see before that this verse is in the portion of the Psalms which reveals the enjoyment of God in God's house. This kind of tasting and seeing must be in the house of God. God is in His house. If we are not in His house, how can we taste Him and see Him? We taste and see that God is good in His house, that is, in Christ, in the church, and eventually in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Enjoying the Riches in God's House</H2><P>Psalm 36:7-9 reveals the psalmist's enjoyment of the riches in God's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Taking Refuge in the Shadow of God's Wings<br>under His Lovingkindness</H2><P>The psalmist took refuge in the shadow of God's wings under His lovingkindness (36:7). I experienced taking refuge in the shadow of God's wings in 1938, after Japan had invaded China. I was arrested by the Japanese and placed in prison for one night, and the Lord did a marvelous thing to rescue me. Then five years later, in 1943, they arrested me again and put me into prison for thirty days. When I was in prison at that time, I took refuge in the shadow of God's wings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Saturated with the Fatness<br>(the Abundance, the Riches) of God's House</H2><P>Psalm 36:8 says that those who enjoy the riches in God's house are saturated with the fatness (the abundance, the riches) of God's house. God's house is full of the riches of God, the fatness. I have been in this house for over sixty years, and I have enjoyed many riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Drinking of the River of God's Pleasures</H2><P>Psalm 36:8 also says that we can drink of the river of God's pleasures&#151;not just one kind of pleasure, but many pleasures. In God's house, there is a river. The end of the Bible reveals that there is a river flowing in the New Jerusalem, the holy city, and that river spirals from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the whole city (Rev. 22:1).</P>
