   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for this gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How good it is that You have gathered us together to meet You not only with the Word but as the Word, to meet You as the Spirit, to meet You as all the saints, and to meet You as the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we believe that You have something on Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We look unto You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Open up Yourself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By Your mercy we are also ready.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We come here to meet You, to touch Your heart, and to see what is on Your heart.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We open up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We open up our entire being to You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We want to gain You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, do grant us Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cleanse us with Your precious blood and defeat Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, chase him away from here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bind him and destroy him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since we have released the high peak of God's divine revelation, my burden is that we need to see the practicality and the reality of living a life according to this high peak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not just want to have a so-called seeing of the high peak, without taking care of touching it and entering into it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is my burden today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The burden of these messages can be expressed in the following four statements:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b-21a.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To build up the Body of Christ by growing into Him, the Head, in all things Eph 4:15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The general subject is: "The Practical Way to Live a Life according to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This general subject contains a number of crucial points, and we need to get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The title of this first message is: "To Have a Clear View concerning the Accomplishments of the Processed and Consummated Triune God A Crystallization-study of the Holy Scriptures ."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Over the past twenty-one years, we have had the life-study of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But since the beginning of this year, I have had the burden to go on to have another category of the study of the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This category is the crystallization-study of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the outline of this message, there are altogether forty points: nine main points and thirty-one subpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am presenting all these points to give us a clear view of what our God, the processed and consummated Triune God, has done and is still doing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am presenting these points with all the Scripture references in a crystallization way for you to get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I. HEAVENLY, SPIRITUAL, MYSTERIOUS,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>MARVELOUS, EXCELLENT, DIVINE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>AND HUMAN AS WELL</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God, everything He has done and is doing for us, are heavenly, spiritual, mysterious, marvelous, excellent, divine and human as well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>FOR THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>IN THE NEW CREATION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever God has done and is doing is all for the organic Body of Christ in God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>FOR THE CARRYING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God are for the carrying out of His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first major thing God accomplished for the carrying out of His economy was incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then He passed through human living, He accomplished an all-inclusive death, He carried out an all-conquering resurrection, and He entered into an all-transcending ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These are the five categories, or five steps, of God's move: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
