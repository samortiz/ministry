   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It Was Given by Him Shenyang</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a conference with Brother Fang Ai-guang from Peking, we established the Lord's table on January 29 of this year.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were more than forty brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We preached the gospel during the first month of the lunar calendar, and the Lord gradually has added the saved ones to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There were two baptism meetings in April and in June.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We added fifty-four newly saved brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With the addition of the brothers and sisters who migrated to Shenyang from other localities, we now have one hundred twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was only one room in our old meeting hall on Minzhu Road in the Hoping District.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We experienced great difficulties with every meeting and dared not expand the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consequently, all the brothers and sisters cried constantly to the Lord and begged Him to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church began to pray on December 13 of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We saw the Lord accomplish the matter of a meeting place on July 20 of this year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What He has given us is far greater than what we asked or thought.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We moved into the new meeting hall and began the meetings there on the twenty-second of this month the Lord's Day .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brothers and sisters do not have much financial supply; many brothers are unemployed and have problems making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the Lord's gospel could not be preached and sinners could not be saved, we still earnestly beseeched the ever-living God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He heard the prayers of the church and finally showed us His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the obstacles were broken through.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we remembered the Lord for the first time in the new meeting hall on the twenty-second the Lord's Day , all the brothers and sisters were happy and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We could not refrain from dancing, shouting thanks, weeping, and praising because we saw that the Lord has performed a miracle in Shenyang!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were all in an inexpressible, indescribable condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was a gospel meeting on the Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers and sisters all served in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who brought new ones brought many; those who cared for people really cared.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The place was nearly full.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we drew the net, forty-six people left their names.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since May we have recorded the names of more than two hundred people who are interested in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the matter of service, we have made some arrangements concerning visitation and making up the new believer edification lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are seeing the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of the brothers and sisters have given themselves to the Lord with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have given their whole lives and do not want to go out free.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are willing and happy to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the work ahead and the needs on all sides are too many and too great.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are immature and shallow in life; we cannot bear this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the Lord has made this arrangement, we can only prostrate ourselves, looking to Him for mercy so that He would lead us in the way before us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We hope that all the brothers and sisters would remember us before the Lord and pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the brothers in Shenyang,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ren Li-ping, Shan Jing-zhou, Shen Yu-shi, and Kuan Yu-nong</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>October 31, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's Grace Was Greater than Our Capacity</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After arriving in Ch'ang-ch'un, we prayed for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are in a wilderness area, and the Lord has placed us small and weak ones here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have no other way but to kneel before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Recently, the Lord has shown us that He is the Lord of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the One who opens a highway in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the One who brings the rivers to the deserts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He operates in the church to accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we did not look at our smallness but went to Dalian and Shenyang to prostrate ourselves before God with the brothers and sisters so that He would give us a new vision and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the fellowship of the Body, we communicated with the entire church what we had seen and touched in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We asked the Lord to give us more so that we could serve all God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have no other way but to humbly look to God to take us on each step of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We hope to encounter God's power more in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord is also leading us to live in faith by His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning the conferences in Dalian and Shenyang, the Lord's grace was greater than our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At Shenyang brothers and sisters came from more than ten other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sister Kang gave the sisters some leading.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the meetings we helped them coordinate together; this built up the service of the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the church has been graced, it must continue with the proper service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Otherwise, it will appear as if it has run out of the proper vessels to contain the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May our arrangements all be according to the Lord's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Your little brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hua Tien-min and Xing Zuo-hsin</S>
