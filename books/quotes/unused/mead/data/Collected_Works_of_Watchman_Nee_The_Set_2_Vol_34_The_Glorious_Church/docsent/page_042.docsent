   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us read again the last part of verse 3: "He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do we see the relationship between God and man?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does it really mean for us to be the people of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It means that God will dwell with us, and therefore, we will be made His people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does it mean that God will be our God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means that God will be with us, and therefore, He will be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are away from His presence, God cannot be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The greatest and highest blessing in eternity is that God will be with us and be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 4 says, "And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All men have experienced the shedding of tears, but in the new heaven and new earth they will receive this blessing God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Death is wholly a consequence of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in the new heaven and new earth, there will no longer be any death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The last enemy will be abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sorrow or mourning is the aching of our heart, the feeling of inward suffering; crying is the weeping without, the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Pain is the suffering of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God will put an end to all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are all summed up in the words: every tear, death, sorrow, crying, and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But they will be no more; they will all pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 5 says, "And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The difficulty that we face today is that even though we are the new creation, we still live in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in that day all things will become new; all things will be in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only will the inward being be new, but the outward will be as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire environment and all things within it will be made new.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is called eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The new creation is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our hearts will be satisfied only when all things are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 6 speaks of a painful experience which we all share: "I am a man of unclean lips."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition, another painful experience is recorded: "And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in that day, everything around us will be in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That day will be absolutely glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 21:5 continues, "And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How good it is to have this written down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God gave these words to John and asked him to write them down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not one iota or one serif of what is written can pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These words are faithful and true!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our ultimate faith will be to see God win the final victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 6, God told John, "They have come to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On what ground could God say to John that it is done?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He can say this because He is "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It often seems that God's work has not been successful, but He says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God made the original design, and God also will bring it to its final completion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How we thank God that He is the Alpha, the initiator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God..."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the heavens and the earth were created, God purposed all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All things had their beginning in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, He is also the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man can and will fail, but God is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man may say this and man may say that, but God has the last word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God spoke these things because He wants to tell us that He will bring His plan to fulfillment, He will reach His goal, and He will accomplish what He has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We acknowledge that Satan's work has indeed interrupted the work of God, but we further acknowledge that God is not only the Alpha who purposed in the beginning, but also the Omega who will finally succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God never gives up, and He will never let any of His purpose remain unfulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of the church's condition in her present experience, she will have no spot, wrinkle, or any such things in God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, she will be clothed with glory and presented to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we see God's children differing so much with each other in faith and doctrine as well as in practice, we wonder how it is possible for them to ever come to the oneness of the faith, as spoken of in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We often sigh and say that this could never happen, even if we waited for another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God said that He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The day will come when He will have a glorious church before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He may use water or He may use fire, but He will certainly have a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot hinder God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will obtain that which will satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No matter how weak, how indifferent, or how hardened we are, there will be a day when God will smash us to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will break us and shatter us so that we will become what He desires us to be.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since God is doing it, He will pursue it to the end. He will never let up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us praise Him with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He must attain His goal!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 6 continues, "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The emphasis here is not upon redemption but upon our need for God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The meaning of thirst is a need for God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To be without God means that we are without water.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, the fountain of the water of life is for the satisfaction of those who are thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we must pay close attention to verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How we thank God for the especially precious promise in this verse, telling us what the overcomers will obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The overcomers spoken of here are different from those mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The overcomers in chapters two and three are a group from the whole church, while the overcomers spoken of here are connected with "him who thirsts."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The preceding verse says, "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then verse 7 says, "He who overcomes will inherit these things."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In other words, those who drink of the fountain of the water of life are the overcomers spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These overcomers differ from those who do not drink of this water.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This kind of overcoming is the same as that which is spoken of in 1 John 5:4: "For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those who are begotten of God, those who belong to the Lord, have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who do not belong to the Lord do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>And this faith causes us to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This surely should make us glad and make us rejoice and shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the new heaven and new earth we are all overcomers!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The man-child in the age of the kingdom is constituted of a minority, but in the New Jerusalem, the entire Body overcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the New Jerusalem it is only a matter of whether or not we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we have faith, we are an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In that day God will wipe away every tear from our eyes; and death will be no more, neither will there be sorrow, crying, or pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But all these things are negative aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The positive is that "He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In verse 7 God also says, "I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Therefore, our position before God as Christians is not only as people, but as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God wants to have many sons enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We thank and praise God that He said, "I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There is no higher blessing in eternity than this.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Verse 8 says, "But the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Just as the blessing in eternity is a fact, so the punishment in eternity is also a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The punishment from the God of love is unavoidable and inescapable.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is a severe warning to everyone.</S>
