   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Fall of Religious Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second event to follow the rapture of the firstfruit will be the fall of religious Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 8 says, And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The modifying clause, who has made all the nations drink..., indicates that Babylon here refers to the religious, mysterious Babylon, which is the Roman Catholic Church, as in 17:2-6, not the material Babylon, as in 18:2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Antichrist breaks the covenant with Israel in the middle of the last week seven years, Dan 9:27; 11:31 , he will destroy every religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will mark the beginning of the great tribulation which will continue for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Antichrist will exalt himself above all gods and compel people to worship him as God Dan 8:9-11; 11:36-37; 2 Thes 2:3-4; Rev 13:4-6, 12, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, he will destroy religious Babylon, the apostate Roman Catholic Church 17:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, religious Babylon will fall at the beginning of the great tribulation, whereas material Babylon will fall after the great tribulation 18:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The wine of her fornication indicates the spiritual fornication of the Roman Catholic Church which she has made all the nations drink of 17:2-6; 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While she commits her fornication, she is furious with the saints who do not consent to it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the fury of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the wine of her fornication is also called the wine of the fury of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that in the middle of the last seven years Antichrist will be resuscitated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prior to his resuscitation, he will be assassinated as the seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the spirit of Caesar Nero emerges from the abyss and enters into him, he will be resuscitated to be the eighth Caesar, thereby becoming a supernatural being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After his resuscitation, he will destroy every religion and make himself the sole object of religious worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will not only abolish the Jewish sacrifices and destroy Judaism; he will also destroy the rider on the beast described in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The woman sitting on a scarlet beast 17:3 is the great prostitute 17:1 , the apostate Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The beast signifies the Roman Empire, especially Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to this picture, an evil woman, the Roman Catholic Church, will be riding on the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not long after the time of Constantine the Great, the church degraded to such an extent that it not only became apostate, but also worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It grew so powerful that it became a rider sitting on the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in the middle of the last seven years, the beast, Antichrist, will revoke his covenant with the Jews, destroy Judaism, and no longer tolerate any religion, including Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will turn his back on Catholicism and, with the ten kings, will utterly obliterate it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this matter God is truly sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Antichrist will exalt himself above God, actually he will be used by God to destroy two religions Judaism and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is similar to the destruction of religion under communism in China.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the communists oppose God, they do not realize that they have been used by God to demolish so many different religions, such as Buddhism and Taoism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prior to 1949, there were idol temples throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today these temples have been cleared away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, although the communists are opposing Jesus Christ, they still use His calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to history, the one whose calendar you follow is the one to whom you are subject.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the communists use His calendar, even they are subjects of the Lord Jesus unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, because Jesus is King of kings, the entire earth uses His calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All people are subject to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How sovereign is our Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is sovereign over all those who oppose Him, even using their opposition to accomplish His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Antichrist exalts himself to be God, the Lord Jesus will use him to destroy Judaism and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Antichrist will do a good cleaning job for the Lord, purging the earth of religion and making it ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, when the Lord Jesus comes to defeat Antichrist, religion will have been cleared away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. The Warning Against the Worship of the Beast and His Image and Against the Mark</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the rapture of the firstfruit, a warning will be given against the worship of the beast and his image and against the mark vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verses 9 and 10 say, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fire and brimstone mentioned in verse 10 refer to the fire and brimstone in the lake of fire 19:20; 20:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who worship the beast and his image and who receive the mark of his name will be eternally tormented and have no rest day and night v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 12 says, Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The saints who will remain in the great tribulation will need endurance to suffer the persecution by Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The saints in the great tribulation will be of two peoples: the Jews who keep the commandments of God and the believers who keep the faith of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>D. The Martyrdom in the Great Tribulation</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the great tribulation many saints will be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 13 says, And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time forth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The dead here refer to the martyrs under the persecution of Antichrist during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is proved by 20:4.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this verse we read of the blessing upon those who are martyred during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These martyrs will rest, and all they have done will follow them as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The book of Revelation, written under the degradation of the church, stresses the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 13 does not say, says the scripture, but, says the Spirit.</S>
