   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. BELIEVERS TO BE JUDGED BY THE CHURCH A. The Saints to Judge the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 6:1 Paul asks, Does any one of you, having a case against another, dare to be judged before the unrighteous and not before the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The unrighteous are the unbelievers, who are unjust before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 2 Paul continues, Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the smallest judgments?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the coming kingdom age the overcoming saints will rule over the nations of the world Heb 2:5-6; Rev 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As co-kings with Christ, these overcoming saints will judge the world in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the world will be judged by the saints, they are certainly worthy of the smallest judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These judgments are those carried out by a number of saints judging cases among themselves, cases which are trifling compared to the ruling of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here Paul seems to be saying, If you will be able to judge great things, are you not able to judge the small things today?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why don t you let the saints judge your cases?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why do you bring your case to unbelievers for judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. The Saints to Judge Angels</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 3 says, Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention things of this life?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Things of this life indicates that judgment over the angels by the saints will be in the future, not in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This probably refers to the judgment over the angels revealed in 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 6.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The angels mentioned in these verses and those referred to in Ephesians 2:2; 6:12; and Matthew 25:41 must be the evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus we, the believers of Christ, will judge not only the human world, but also the angelic world in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Going to Law before Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being Condemned</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 4 Paul says, If then you have judgments as to things of this life, do you set them to judge who are little esteemed in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This refers to the unbelievers, who are little esteemed in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, going to law before unbelievers is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>D. A Case between Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Should Be Judged by the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 5 Paul goes on to say, I say this to your shame.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus there is not even one among you, no one who is wise, who will be able to discern between his brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter four Paul said that he was not shaming the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But here he says that what he writes is to their shame.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He fully disagreed with brother going to law with brother, and that before unbelievers v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>E. A Defeat to Have Lawsuits among Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verses 7 and 8 Paul says, Already, therefore, it is altogether a defeat for you that you have lawsuits among yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why not rather be wronged?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why not rather be defrauded?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But you wrong and defraud, and this your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Paul says that it is already a defeat for believers to have lawsuits among themselves, he means that it is a failure, implying defect, fault, loss, and falling short in the inheritance of the kingdom of God v. 9 . Willingness to be wronged or defrauded is willingness to suffer loss, to learn the lesson of the cross, to keep the virtue of Christ at some cost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, Paul asks why the believers were not willing to be wronged, why they were not willing to learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of suffering loss, they were actually wronging others and defrauding them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be sure, Paul s words here are very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once again I wish to point out that the dealing here concerns claiming our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The claiming of rights issues from the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the flesh results from living in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, when we live in the soul, the lusts will come in, and when the lusts come in, we shall insist on our rights and claim them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No doubt, Paul deliberately dealt with the first three problems in a particular sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First he deals with division, which comes from the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, he deals with gross sin, which comes from the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, he deals with the claiming of rights.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both in the church life and in the family life we have this problem of the claiming of our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Two brothers may have a problem with each other, and each may claim his rights in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 6:1-11 Paul was burdened by this claiming of our personal rights.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is hidden within all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all have the tendency to claim our rights in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may argue that they have never taken anyone to court or never brought anyone to the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although they may not have done such things, within them they have the intention to claim their rights.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For instance, they may say to themselves, Why did this brother treat me like that?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To say this proves that we are claiming our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the sight of God to claim our rights in our heart is the same as taking a brother to the law court.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This claiming of rights needs to be uprooted and thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was Paul s aim in writing these verses.</S>
