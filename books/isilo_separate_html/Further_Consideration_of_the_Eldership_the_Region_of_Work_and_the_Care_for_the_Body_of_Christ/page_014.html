If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body, we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body. Although the verses in the Scripture reading may be familiar to us, I would like to point out two of them. Ephesians 5:21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ." First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."</P><P>In the previous message, I touched three problems that have been among us&#151;pride (mostly among the young people), heroism (mostly among the middle-aged), and opinions (mostly among the older ones). In our fellowship in this message, we want to address a few problems which have been existing among us for years. Until these problems are solved and removed, the church life will not have much peace, and the recovery will be greatly devastated. We expect to have the proper increase and the growth in life. But due to these problems, the church has been greatly limited in the increase and delayed in the growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO CARE FOR<br>THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Throughout the years, we have found out that regardless of how much we teach about the oneness of the Body, some among us would not take care of this oneness. When I was in the Lord's work in mainland China, I saw a number of turmoils. Thank the Lord that I was preserved from any involvement in these turmoils. Eventually, the Lord sent me to Taiwan. In Taiwan there was one serious turmoil which took place from 1957 to 1965. In 1978 we had a turmoil in the recovery in the United States. Then nine years later, in 1987, we had a second turmoil. This turmoil is still lingering among us. It has not altogether passed away. Because of this, I want us to see the root of this problem. The source, or the root, of this present turmoil is the carelessness in our regard for the oneness of the Body. We have taught much concerning the Body, and we have printed many books concerning the Body, but when a certain situation arises, not many would take care of the Body. To take care of the Body is to take care of the oneness. If the oneness is gone, the Body is finished. No oneness&#151;no Body. The Body can only exist and survive in the oneness.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
