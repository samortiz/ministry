<P>Question: If a person is in an improper situation, how should we regard him in relation to the Lord's table?</P><P>Answer: Only the Lord knows what to do or say in such a case. Isaiah was a holy prophet, but when he saw the vision of the Lord, he said, "Woe is me, for I am finished! For I am a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell" (Isa. 6:5). We may think that we are holy, but when we get into the Lord's presence, our conscience tells us that we are not holy. No one is right. Who is qualified to take the Lord's table? We must learn to minister the positive things to people and see whether there is the real fruit of repentance.</P><P>Question: For the sake of time, is it proper to contact people by telephone, or do we need to visit them or have them into our homes?</P><P>Answer: Today under the Lord's sovereignty we have modern conveniences. The telephone is one of these. We should use the telephone as much as we can for the Lord's interest. It is altogether a profit to call people by telephone. If possible, we may make two or three phone calls a day to the persons for whom we are concerned. The telephone may also be used for morning watch. Our calling people, however, should be done in a warm way from the Lord.</P><P>Question: Should those who are not elders also contact new ones in the way we have fellowshipped here?</P><P>Answer: Contacting people is not a responsibility of only the elders. All the saints should do this. We are in a big "pond" full of "fish." We should speak Christ to people every day.</P><P>Question: In the eldership we cannot help but see things. How can we have discernment without turning it into something negative?</P><P>Answer: The practice of what we have fellowshipped here depends upon our own experience and realization. Whenever we have seen others' failures, we should firstly sympathize with them. Without the Lord's mercy, we would be the same as they are. To consider in this way is helpful. We must realize what we are and experience the Lord's mercy and grace. This will help us to take care of others with sympathy. The person whom we contact may be a weak person, but we also are weak persons. By the Lord's mercy, we may not have given Satan the ground to damage us as this person has, but we must be very watchful and careful lest we fail in the same way.</P><P>We may or may not know a person's failures and sins, but if we minister Christ as life to him, Christ will care for him. He will gradually see the light and repent. We must strongly learn the lesson that it is better not to touch others' failures. We should simply contact people, ministering Christ to them. Then the Lord will do many things. Many confessions are made to the Lord secretly and privately every day by His saints, but all these repentances come from the help of a certain ministry. Without the help of someone's ministering, it is not easy for a person to repent. The church needs the elders' proper contact with people.</P>
