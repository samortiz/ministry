Thank Him for manifesting His presence and His co-laboring. In the morning we added a meeting for preaching the gospel and simple Bible study. Sister Wang (Yu-ju) was responsible for it. Thank and praise the Lord. He gave Sister Wang good health and a good voice; she was able to preach messages and do translation for several days without getting tired. There will be a meeting to preach salvation to women in the future. We are still before God about it. Please pray concerning this. Yesterday, I received The Normal Christian Church Life from Shanghai. I really thank God for His mercy in allowing His children to see His light more clearly. I am doing my best to read it through with prayer, and I also ask God to bless this book and give grace to all its readers. I hope that those who care for God's work and the church and who are willing to keep the truth will be able to obtain this book. May the Lord return soon!</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Hsu-min<br />April 2</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Northern Fukien</h2><p>I have read the fifth issue of The Open Door. I know that the Lord cares for each of His people and keeps them safe. He also opens the door for the gospel to us in every place. We really thank the Lord! May He greatly revive His work in these years! I left Ku-Tien last month and went north to Sha County to work for a few days. I returned to Yen-Ping on the third of the month. The evening I arrived I began a conference in Yen-Ping with three meetings a day. There is a good opportunity here. However, the northern part of Fukien is really pitiful. It is very desolate! Therefore, we who are in the valley must hope that the co-workers on the mountain would be faithful to raise your hands for us. Please ask God to raise up His work in every place and to send more workers to continue His work. May His eternal purpose be quickly accomplished. Sister Ong Yu-bing arrived yesterday from Jien-Ou. She will render some help to the women's work. After her work in Yen-Ping, she will go north. I will probably continue moving south.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Bi-yin<br />April 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Work at Yi-Hu, Swatow, Kwangtung</h2><p>On the twelfth of this month, two sisters, another brother, and I went to Yi-Hu to do some work. Thank the Lord. We witnessed the work of the Holy Spirit in this conference. Some people were saved and others were edified. Two marvelous things occurred during this time. A cloth merchant who was a nominal Christian came to listen to the word on the first day. He did not receive anything. The second day he went into the countryside to sell his cloth. He tried to sell for a long time but could not make any sales. While he was suffering, in his heart he prayed, "O God, if You want me to listen to the messages, let me sell ten dollars worth of cloth." After this prayer, he immediately sold ten dollars worth of cloth. He came back right away to listen to the messages. He was saved that evening. There was another person who had left the truth for more than ten years. He had even burned his Bible and hymnal. He returned to the Lord during this conference. His whole family now comes to hear the word. There were eight days of meetings in this conference. We returned safely home on the twenty-first. The brothers and sisters here are at peace. Brother Chen Wen-kwang's health is much better. Perhaps he can come to Swatow in a little more than a month.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />James Chen<br />March 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_121.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_123.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 122</div><br></body></html>
