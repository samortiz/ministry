[3]  If the Lord grants us a little light concerning what we are, we will receive great profit; this profit will be more than what we could learn by ourselves in twenty years.
[4]  When our feeling of weakness is light, it is a hindrance to us; we feel that we can still do something and that there is still something about which we can boast.
[5]  If we want to wait until we have reached a certain standard, we may find that we have less and less in our hands as time goes on.
[6]  THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN FOR GOD'S WORD
[7]  James Yen: Can a person receive God's word and at the same time promises from Satan?
[8]  Watchman Nee: Even when we have God's word and promises, we cannot say immediately that this is God's speaking.
[9]  Miss Lin Wei-shi: In the past I had many things to say when I prayed.
[10]  In our experience we should not be as foolish as a mule, but we should be like a maidservant looking at the hand of her mistress.
[11]  We have to realize that the objective facts do not change, but our feelings change.
[12]  Christ's salvation ushers us into a life in Christ, a life of objective realities.
[13]  Humanly speaking, the feelings that we possess seem very reliable, but they change; they are not really reliable.
[14]  Question: In my work, I find that there often is the need but that I lack boldness.
[15]  Watchman Nee: Whether or not our work is a success or a failure depends on whether we bring a proper atmosphere to a place or whether the atmosphere in a place affects us.
[16]  When we move from Hong Kong to Canton, do we allow the Canton atmosphere to get into us, or do we bring our atmosphere to the church?
[17]  We must have a gospel spirit before we can light the gospel fire, but there must be a proper atmosphere before we can light the fire.
[18]  Not only do we need the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit in our gospel preaching; we need it in maintaining the church and the work.
[19]  Watchman Nee: The few of you in Hong Kong bear a great responsibility.
[20]  I would like to mention one thing about the meetings in Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong: The atmosphere in these places is wrong.
[21]  If you cannot do this, you will find as you work in Southeast Asia and in Hong Kong that you may serve others with a bowl of bitter herbs, but they will not feel that they are bitter at all.
[22]  If we cannot find a partner, we can still go alone, but we have to be on the alert that we are bringing men to the Lord all the time.
[23]  Brother Kaung, is there something that you want to say?
[24]  If we allow our thoughts to wander and roam unchecked, we will find that we cannot focus our mind when we are called to serve in prayer.
[25]  Concerning the second point, that is, spiritual fire, I would like to say this: Fire relates to supply.
[26]  If there is no problem with our personal consecration, it may be God's leading that we should seek His supply.
[27]  First, I feel that my spiritual condition does not match what I know, what I teach, or what I have heard.
[28]  Perhaps a few people in the church have five talents, but we almost have to wait for a hundred years before we can come across a few of these great gifts.
[29]  In order to raise up the one-talented ones, instead of letting their talent remain hidden in the earth, there is the need of perfecting trainings and spiritual education.
[30]  In perfecting the saints, we should not select just the ones who are in high positions, who have money, who have worldly experience, or who are competent in the world.
[31]  The fallen mentality thinks that only we ourselves can do a job, but we have to perfect others to do it and help them to do it.
[32]  If we are faithful to the Lord, He will get through in us, and the brothers and sisters will have a way to follow us.
[33]  We need to speak two things in relation to church affairs.
[34]  First, we have to be watchful of the leading brothers.
[35]  In the meetings, it is true that the brothers and sisters should not express their own opinions, but neither should they wait for someone to come and help them.
[36]  One can study the Bible alone privately, but he also can study it corporately with the brothers and sisters.
[37]  If we are not careful and serious in our study of the Word, we can easily build a message upon a wrong translation of a word.
[38]  Therefore, we should never consider God's Word in a light way; neither should we consider that anyone can expound it at will or preach the gospel from it.
[39]  The third way to study the Bible is by the way of synthesis.
[40]  In Philippians Paul told us that he not only preached the gospel, but he was also given to the defense of the gospel.
[41]  Paul said that we have to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom Col 3:16 .
[42]  But if we are the only ones who are working, and no one else is perfected to work with us, sooner or later we will be exhausted even if we have the proper way.
[43]  Gospel visitation is also an important work of the church.
[44]  We have to pay attention to a number of points: How do we knock on others' doors?
[45]  How should we respond when we have the answer, and how should we respond when we do not have the answer?
[46]  When we meet the gospel friends, we can say, "I am coming to you on behalf of the church; the church cares for you and has heard that you have believed in the Lord Jesus.
[47]  We have fellowshipped about this matter before, and we have made a public announcement that co-workers who do not have a letter of recommendation should not be accepted into the work.
[48]  When God does not answer our prayer, it is because He does not want to spoil us or because we are wrong in some areas and in need of confession and repentance.
[49]  This passage clearly shows us that we cannot give ourselves to the gospel unless we give ourselves to the Lord.
[50]  Today, when we preach the gospel, we have to be like the Lord who forsook everything in order that others would share the blessing of the gospel.
[51]  A normal Christian should be one who is totally consecrated.
[52]  Our Christian confession is our primary profession; this is not something that we do on the side.
[53]  First, we have to be absolute for the Lord and His gospel.
[54]  The Epistles show us that the principle of offering is, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" 2 Cor 8:15 .
[55]  Of course, God allows some to have lack so that the ones who have excess can be tested in their heart to see if they love the Lord and the brothers more than mammon.
[56]  Consecration is not mainly offering our possessions to God, but offering ourselves and our heart to God.
[57]  It is true that we have problems, but we have the Lord, and He can take care of all our needs.
[58]  Admittedly, the older brothers and sisters may not be able to match the young people in evangelism, zeal, or energy, but they should not say that they cannot match the young people in consecration and love for the Lord.
[59]  Concerning our feeling for every spiritual thing, we have to inquire of the Lord, and we have to open ourselves to His dealing.
[60]  If we do not have any preconceived idea about a matter, the Lord will give us the light and we will develop a proper feeling.
[61]  When we speak, we should say that we are not speaking from ourselves, but we are quoting Brother So-and-so.
[62]  As we learn to touch the Lord's Spirit with our spirit and as we turn our heart fully to the Lord as the writer did, we can lay aside every earthly possession.
[63]  In the light of the entire history of the church, we can say that today is our day.
[64]  It did not have the boldness to tell men that they have to forsake everything to follow the Lord, that unless they forsook everything, they could not be proper Christians.
[65]  The value of the books was fifty thousand pieces of silver v. 19 . If Judas had been there, he would have been in rage, saying, "Why this waste? These books at least could be sold at twenty percent discount, and we could give forty thousand pieces of silver to the poor." The Holy Spirit wanted to burn them because these objects were related to sin.
[66]  What should we do with all the money that has been handed over?
[67]  First, use it to spread the gospel, second, use it to help the poor, and third, spend it on the brothers and sisters in the church.
[68]  In Matthew 19, after the episode with the young ruler, Peter asked the Lord about the reward he and the others would receive since they had forsaken everything for the gospel Matt 19:27; Mark 10:28 .
[69]  The Lord answered, "There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel's sake, but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life" Mark 10:29-30 .
[70]  We say that we are giving our heart to the Lord, yet our mammon is in the bank.
[71]  Only the Lord can see our heart, because only He is the one who searches the inward parts and the hearts Rev 2:23 .
[72]  The Lord does not ask us to give Him our heart, but He does ask us to bring Him our money.
[73]  Let me shout this again: The Lord does not say that we should not love mammon and love God instead.
[74]  When we see the brothers and sisters hungry and lacking food, we have to take care of their needs more urgently than we take care of our business.
[75]  If the brothers and sisters do not have daily necessities such as towels or toothbrushes at home, would we have the audacity to keep many of these items at home or, worse still, to display other useless objects around our house?
[76]  The best thing for us to do is to ask the responsible brothers to come to our house and see if there are things that need to be given to the needy saints or see if there are things that need to be sold for the poor saints.
[77]  Even if we offer an item to the church and the church returns it to us, we will have the feeling that the item has been consecrated.
[78]  If sin does not go away, the gospel will not go out, and if money does not go away, the gospel will not go out either.
[79]  Let us talk a little about what one should do, how one should live, and how one should coordinate with others after he has consecrated himself.
[80]  He will ask, "What should I do now that I have handed over all my possessions?"
[81]  This is important because we have not only handed over our possessions, but ourselves, our very person, as well.
[82]  From this point forward, where we live, the job we take, and the future we have must all be determined by the gospel.
[83]  I have wanted to say a word for many years.
[84]  Had they not done this, the Lord could not have entered Jerusalem.
[85]  This does not mean that the branches and the garments are the way in and of themselves, but it does mean that these ones first had to break many branches and take off many garments to cover the way before the Lord could enter the city in His glory.
[86]  If we have any reservations, if we hold back anything, or if we are unwilling to fall down, the Lord will have no way.
[87]  CHAPTER NINE FORSAKING EVERYTHING TO SERVE GOD Date:Evening, February 3, 1950
[88]  Among God's children today, there is the thought that service to God is a favor to Him.
[89]  If we have seen His glory, however, we will be like Paul who regarded everything as refuse in comparison to the excellency of Christ Phil 3:8-9 .
[90]  Once we sense the glory of serving the Lord, we will be able to lead many by the hand even though we may be young men ourselves.
[91]  The more we treasure the Lord, the more we will give our all to Him.
[92]  When we know His glory, we will say to Him, Not only am I offering my past and present treasures; I am offering everything I will have in the future.
[93]  " If we try to hold anything back, our inner being will feel suffocated; we will not be comfortable unless we consecrate.
[94]  But if we remain in ourselves, hesitating to strike back only because we think this is what a Christian should do and keeping our anger within, we will only suffer.
[95]  We are clear about a person's individual position and his way, but how should the church go on?
[96]  We must take time and place into consideration in selling our all.
[97]  After you have handed your possessions over, if the church says that you should sell something, it will return the items to you and ask you to sell them.
[98]  How should we serve in the church after we have sold our all?
[99]  We have to submit to the careful arrangement of the older, leading brothers who make decisions under the control of the Holy Spirit.
[100]  In the future we hope that we will offer up our occupation to God for the accomplishment of His gospel.
[101]  If the whole church can send out five thousand, ten thousand, or even fifty thousand people, how much the Lord will bless His church!
[102]  If everything we have is offered up for the gospel, the church, and the Lord's service, the Lord and the gospel will have a free way through the church.
[103]  All servants of God as well as all Bible students pay much attention to the state of glory which the church must reach before the second coming of the Lord.
[104]  In this chapter we are told that when the Lord comes back, the church will be without spot as far as its very nature is concerned and that it will also be without blemish.
[105]  In order to be a servant of God and in order to serve Him, we have to uphold His will.
[106]  We cannot change God's will, and we cannot lower His standard for the church.
[107]  A person from a denomination once said, "The Bible does not say explicitly that we should not smoke.
[108]  The smokers may feel that they are actually better than others in many areas, but as long as some brothers and sisters think that it is wrong to smoke, the smokers will have to stop if they want to keep their fellowship with them.
[109]  When we preach the gospel to others today, do we tell them that they can be rich and at the same time live a Christian life?
[110]  If you and I neglect our responsibility today, I do not know how long we will delay the Lord.
[111]  Let me say a strong word: If we want to follow the Lord, we must tell Him that we will forsake everything to follow Him.
[112]  Handing ourselves over does not necessarily mean that we will become poor.
[113]  When we hand ourselves over to God, we are not only giving Him our money but our time and future as well.
[114]  If we have not offered up our time, body, and future, we may say that we have consecrated everything, but in reality everything is still in our own hands.
[115]  In the past we preached the gospel when we felt like it, but we turned away from the brothers when we grew cold and disinterested.
[116]  However, if many of you brothers and sisters are together at the same school, and if you all have a strong spirit to preach the gospel and to bring others to salvation, I have no objection for your staying.
[117]  If we hand over our all and waste ourselves on the gospel, succeeding generations will have a way to go on.
[118]  Our gospel is not an isolated call of individual voices but a concerted work in which we all consecrate ourselves to coordinate and pray together in one accord.
[119]  In the future, I hope that we will ask instead, "How will this job give me an opportunity for the gospel?"
[120]  May all of us be very clear about what we are doing; that is, may we know the reason we are doing what we are doing and to what extent we should do it.
[121]  CHAPTER ELEVEN A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS 2 Date:February 5, 1950
[122]  Doing things with all sincerity and honesty does not necessarily mean that this is obeying God's will, nor does this necessarily please the Lord.
[123]  And when it was sold, was it not under your authority?" v. 4 . This shows that selling one's all is entirely in one's own hand; it is not a demand of the church or of the Holy Spirit.
[124]  The church has only one commission on this earth to live for the gospel.
[125]  The church exists for the gospel of God, but how many brothers and sisters remember that they do not live for their business, family, living, and future, but for the gospel?
[126]  When we were saved, God gave us not only a new life but also a new profession, which is the preaching of His gospel.
[127]  In Luke 18 the Lord told the young ruler that he had to sell his all to follow Him before he could inherit eternal life.
[128]  After this the Lord told the disciples that it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
[129]  His mistake was not in loving his riches but in his thought that God could not do it because he himself could not do it.
[130]  No man can go through the eye of a needle; no man can hand himself over, but God does not say that we have to do it by ourselves.
[131]  Mammon is like opium; if we only take a little of it, we can drop it easily, but if we take a great deal of it, it will be hard to shake the addiction.
[132]  In the second half of the chapter we find the Lord putting the money back in our hand and charging us to do business.
[133]  God does not call ten unrelated merchants to do different "retail" gospel enterprises; He wants the whole church to be involved in one gospel enterprise.
[134]  If we say that our heart is in heaven but our treasure remains on earth, then we should say to the Lord, "Your Word is not trustworthy!"
[135]  The Lord wants us to be free from our material possessions because He wants our hearts to be truly in heaven on the one hand, and He wants us to invest the treasure that we have offered up in the gospel enterprise on the other hand.
[136]  If we are only concerned about our own investment, our own mammon, while allowing the gospel enterprise to go unattended, the gospel will never spread out over the earth.
[137]  Today the Lord's way is for the whole church to coordinate together to preach the gospel.
[138]  God does not want to take the way of individuals; He wants the corporate service of the whole church.
[139]  In the past perhaps we had the ambition to be an evangelist, but the Lord's intention is not for us to be zealous for the gospel by ourselves; His intention is for the whole church to rise up to preach the gospel together.
[140]  We must not only offer up our money in a passive way; we must live for the gospel and the Lord in an active way.
[141]  Brother Weigh: Lord, You are the Head of the church.
[142]  In all the Gospels God requires that we love the sinners and the poor from the bottom of our hearts.
[143]  This is the reason the Lord said in Luke 4:18 that the poor have the gospel preached to them.
[144]  In the past we could say that we were the middle class, but there are not many people who now belong to the middle class anymore.
[145]  As we preach the gospel to them, we will find a great difference between us and them.
[146]  If we think that living in the villages will wear us out, we should move back to our original place; there is no need to stay there reluctantly and claim that we are preaching the gospel for the Lord's sake.
[147]  The first year John Wesley served the Lord, his total spending was ninety-eight pounds.
[148]  After we have offered up everything, we may be asked to take it back from the hand of the church, but the feeling should be completely different.
[149]  Of course, all of us have different standards of living, but we should always do our best to save our money for the Lord and for the gospel.
[150]  There are a few items which you have handed over.
[151]  It is good that you have handed over your jewelry, but take care that you do not buy any more again.
[152]  He should be like Peter, who said that we should not have for our adorning any jewelry, but should have instead for adornment a meek and quiet spirit 1 Pet 3:3-4 .
[153]  It is a glory to the Lord to see young people being saved and coordinating in the church life for the gospel.
[154]  Before you are married, your parents treat you as a child; you do not have many responsibilities, and you do not have to take care of a family.
[155]  When a man does not have a job, he is careful about the money he receives from his parents, but once he starts earning his own money, he begins to act according to his own preferences and forgets the vow he made before the Lord.
[156]  CONCERNING SCHOOLS Trying the Best to Not Study in Catholic Schools
[157]  The brothers and sisters who are in school should try their best to not attend Catholic schools.
[158]  The Lord's intention is that we do not touch the Catholic Church at all.
[159]  In Shanghai I told some Communist members that Christians are saved in an inward way.
[160]  We are not like the people in the world who become poor after their material goods are confiscated; we voluntarily free ourselves from the bondage of material things.
[161]  If the Lord is gracious to us, I hope that many brothers will rise up, including older ones, and forsake everything to serve in coordination in the church.
[162]  If we can have a fifty percent increase in our gospel, every brother and sister will bring in half a person in a month.
[163]  If we do not take this way, our independent gospel work will not get us very far in ten or twenty more years.
[164]  We all think that the present political climate makes it hard for the church to preach the gospel, but how do we know that this situation is not sovereignly arranged by God?
[165]  If we do not learn to coordinate together for the gospel in the present situation, God may allow the devil's hand to move further, and the situation of the church may worsen still.
[166]  I hope that one day we can break open Hong Kong with explosive power.
[167]  We have to hand ourselves and all we have over and coordinate together to preach the gospel in oneness.
[168]  Let me shout this into our ears: We cannot crave one single thread in this world, while asking the other brothers and sisters to give up the world or to see the vanity of this world.
[169]  If we do not hand ourselves over, we will not have a share even if the church gains many people.
[170]  If the church does not engage in some mode of production, a Christian will not be able to find anything to do in the church, in which case he will have to go to outsiders for work.
[171]  How should we manage a business to secure the Lord's blessing?
[172]  According to Acts 2 and 4, we have to divide to all according to each one's need 2:45; 4:34 .
[173]  There are things that I like to buy when I have a little money in my hand, but I always feel condemned when I have something and my co-workers do not.
[174]  If we hold on to our own things and care only for ourselves without any concern for others, we can never live the life of the Body of Christ, and we can never express it in our living.
[175]  Brothers who are holding one kind of job should coordinate with other brothers who are holding similar jobs; they should preach the gospel together.
[176]  The gospel is weak today among us because brothers and sisters have a selfish motive; they use the mammon they have in their hand for their own business with the view of making money for themselves.
[177]  A FEW THINGS TO NOTE IN HANDING ONESELF OVER
[178]  In making judgments concerning the saints' handing themselves over, we have to be accurate.
[179]  We do not expect all of you to quit work, but some should change jobs and work with the brothers and sisters.
[180]  From the day we hand ourselves over, not only do we love the Lord, but we begin to truly love the brothers and sisters.
[181]  If we have not handed ourselves over, we can only give what we have in excess to others; we cannot love the brothers and sisters.
[182]  In one sense we may say that they were paying back in gratitude what they owed, but it is hard to say that there was any paying back at all, because they all felt that they were unworthy of the Lord.
[183]  Brother Lan once said that we are like beggars; it is actually a joke to say that we are offering anything to God.
[184]  Some of them love Mr. Chiang Chiang Kai-Shek , and some love Mr. Mao Mao Ze-Tung . If either of these two persons were here today and requested a cup of tea from us, we would feel very honored to do it for him; we would not want to hire a servant to do it for us.
[185]  We may have servants at home, and we may be managers in our office, but when we come to the meeting hall we have to learn to do everything by ourselves.
[186]  Romans 12 tells us that we should present our bodies a living sacrifice for the purpose of serving God.
[187]  In giving ourselves to Him, we should not put up any resistance; we should not hold back anything from Him.
[188]  Many brothers and sisters are serving the Lord and the saints in the church, but they do not have any spiritual understanding.
[189]  If we have other interests beside God, such as our treasure, our eyes will not be single, and we will not understand God's will.
[190]  Let me emphasize this: If we want spiritual understanding and if we want to know God's will, we cannot have any contention over our consecration.
[191]  Once we have a problem with our consecration, we will be blind to God's will.
[192]  We have to constantly ask, "I have been insisting that this and that are right, but is it possible that when I receive more grace and experience deeper consecration, I will find these things to be wrong?"
[193]  Paul told the Corinthians that the Lord died in order that we who live would no longer live to ourselves but to Him who died and was raised for us 2 Cor 5:15 .
[194]  If the Lord died and resurrected for us but did not give us a chance to live for Him, it would indeed be a suffering and a pain to live the Christian life.
[195]  We all love money, but if we see how much the Lord has done for us, we will gladly offer up everything for Him.
[196]  When we come to God we should not come empty-handed.
[197]  Let me say a solemn word: We do not give what extra we have to the Lord; we must give all that we have to Him.
[198]  They want to hand them over to the church and let God tear them down, but neither God nor His church will do this.
[199]  If any brothers or sisters have entered into a joint investment of land with unbelievers or family members or jointly own shares with Gentiles, the joint assets should be divided up as soon as possible.
[200]  Anything that you do not have complete ownership of does not necessarily have to be handed over.
[201]  When all the brothers and sisters have these things, I will have them, but I should not be so impatient that I must have them immediately.
[202]  I hope that in handing ourselves over and in our consecration, we will not fail in any area this time.
[203]  If a man does not hand himself over, he cannot love the Lord or the brothers and sisters, much less sinners.
[204]  The brothers who bear special responsibility before the Lord should first let the brothers and sisters know that they should not hand themselves over foolishly.
[205]  Preaching the gospel is the basic and primary occupation of the church.
[206]  The first thing we should consider when we interview for a job is not how much it pays, but whether or not this work will profit the gospel.
[207]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A SIGN BEFORE THE LORD'S COMING Date: February 13, 1950
[208]  Let me say a word of truth: There has never been a time when the world has had as many rich men as we have today.
[209]  When I returned to Shanghai from Foochow, many brothers and sisters came to me in tears and said, "Had I listened to your word, the brothers and sisters as well as the church would have had a chance to enjoy my consecration.
[210]  If we do not seize the opportunity to answer the Spirit's call, one day we will find that our greatest sorrow is the Lord not gaining anything, the church not gaining anything, and the poor not gaining anything.
[211]  Their searching was in a sense sharper than the two-edged sword, but they were so surprised by our brothers and sisters.
[212]  They forced others to share everything in common because they were afraid that no one would do it, but we practice this voluntarily.
[213]  They said that the biblical practice of having everything in common was wrong, and they told the brothers and sisters in Yi-Yang that no one was allowed to practice this.
[214]  We practice having everything in common because we love the brothers, but they thought this was wrong because it would encourage laziness.
[215]  CHAPTER NINETEEN APPOINTMENT OF ELDERS Date: February 14, 1950
[216]  From now on, we have to carry on the work in the church in Hong Kong in a steady way.
[217]  In Hong Kong we had some responsible brothers in the past, but there was not a clear distinction between the co-workers, the responsible brothers, and the elders.
[218]  If you are a co-worker working as an elder, you have to remember that while you are living in Hong Kong, you have to coordinate with the brothers and sisters in the church in Hong Kong to serve the Lord together.
[219]  He is burdened for many practical affairs, but I hope that he will have not only a feeling for practical affairs but a feeling for the brothers and sisters also.
[220]  If we label one brother as useless and another sister as unsuitable, sooner or later all the brothers and sisters will become useless and only we will be useful.
[221]  The Lord does give some five-talented ones to the church, but we must remember that the church is not built upon five-talented gifts or two-talented gifts.
[222]  All the brothers and sisters in the church have to learn to submit to the authority of the elders.
[223]  If we have a proper response, the first thing that will come to our mind when we are confronted by a situation is, "Who should I check with in this situation?"
[224]  The only difference between us and the brothers and sisters is that we know the authority of the Holy Spirit a little more clearly, and we are able to communicate the thought of the Spirit to them.
[225]  If the brothers and sisters make a mistake, we have to rebuke them, not because they have offended our authority, but because we know the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[226]  We want to implement the following in the training for the study of the Bible: We will ask ten brothers to help the saints study the Bible.
[227]  Some may think that it is a waste of time to read through the whole book of Romans in one sitting, but I can only say that there are more words in a day's newspaper than in the entire book of Romans, yet many people can read through a newspaper in one sitting.
[228]  We have to dig into a few reference books before we can understand what studying the Bible really means and before we can train the other brothers and sisters to study in the same way.
[229]  Some of the children, relatives, and friends of our brothers and sisters are still not saved and in the church.
[230]  The brothers and sisters who serve as the nursing mothers should consider and think carefully before the Lord.
[231]  They have to pray to find out the way to help the young brothers and sisters around them and to provide them a place where they can speak and fellowship freely.
[232]  If we have five hundred people who have signed up after a gospel meeting, we are not doing them any good by merely "sending their names to heaven" without visiting them one by one.
[233]  If we preach the gospel on the Lord's Day and a hundred people sign up and express their willingness to receive the Lord, we have to follow up with a second step.
[234]  Once our gospel visitation is strengthened and the number of new believers increases, there is the need of proper edification and perfection.
[235]  If we do not have a good new believers' edification program in the first year, it will be harder to make it up in the second year.
[236]  If we do not edify the new ones properly, we will add more burden to the church; many brothers and sisters will be brought into the church life in a muddled way.
[237]  If this is the case, case the more people we save, the less spiritual the church will become, and the more problems we will have.
[238]  There are always special occasions which arise in the families of the brothers and sisters, such as marriages and funerals.
[239]  If they do not meet any brothers during their stay here, they will feel that this is a lonely and inhospitable place.
[240]  They will feel that the church does not look like a church at all.
[241]  If we establish good fellowship with the visiting brothers, and they receive our help, they will pass on the help to their church.
[242]  When the whole congregation serves this way, the Body will be built up, and day by day the church will move closer to the glorious church spoken of in the Bible, and more and more it will be known as a spiritual church.
[243]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 2 Date: Thursday evening, February 16, 1950
[244]  The hymn that we sang tonight tells us that the manifestation of God's glory enables us to consecrate ourselves.
[245]  In making gospel visitations, it is inevitable that there will be some who have a problem with believing, even though they have put down their name and shown an interest in the gospel.
[246]  I may not be clear about many things, but there are one or two things that I am very clear about: My sins are forgiven, and I have joy and peace through my faith in the Lord."
[247]  Tonight we will consider the responsibilities and services of the deacons.
[248]  The second point about management is that we have to find the way.
[249]  We must not only know how to do things ourselves, but we must help the brothers and sisters do the same, until their work is as good as God's.
[250]  Schooling is a very important matter to the young people.
[251]  However, had he not been taught by his mother from his youth, he would not have known that he was one of God's people, a people of promise Exo 2:1-10 .
[252]  The brothers who have incomes and who are holding jobs should no longer seek to earn money for themselves; they should be for the gospel, and they should seek to open up more opportunities for spreading the gospel.
[253]  The brothers and sisters must be able to study the Bible, manage practical affairs, and preach the gospel.
[254]  If we have some special skill, we will not only support ourselves when we move inland, but we will be able to support others as well.
