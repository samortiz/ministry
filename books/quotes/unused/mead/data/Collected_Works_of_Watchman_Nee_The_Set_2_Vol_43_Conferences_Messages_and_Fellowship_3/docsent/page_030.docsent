   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF DELIVERANCE FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE OLD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we be delivered?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The holiness group says that once a person has uprooted sin, he will never sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese say that since all the evil things come from the evil body, we should practice asceticism to buffet the body so that it will see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, and act no evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this way the body can be fully brought under control.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people who are well-behaved outwardly are corrupt in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once two Christians lived together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One was an aunt, and the other was the niece.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day someone rebuked the aunt for no apparent reason.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She smiled and did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The niece who was watching admired the aunt's reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the person left, she said to her aunt, "He was scolding you, not me, but I was burning."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Her aunt said, "Do you think that I was not burning?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was burning, but the burning was inside."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many think that as long as they have not committed any sin outwardly, they have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How wrong this is!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not deal with the body of sin, nor does He crucify the root of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's work is not carried on outwardly, but inwardly; He deals with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The old man likes to be a slave to sin, so God crucified him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sin entices, tempts, and coerces, while the old man likes being a slave to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, it urges the body to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul said, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him" Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The one being crucified is the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "crucified" in the original Greek is a verb in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is something that has been accomplished forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not say that the old man intends to be crucified with the Lord, nor that the old man will be crucified with the Lord, but that the old man has been crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Christ was crucified, our old man was also included in this crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ died, the old man died as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose a sinner wants to be saved tonight and prays, "O God, please have mercy on me!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord shed His blood for me to redeem me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will certainly tell him that it is wrong to pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He should not ask the Lord to shed His blood again, because the Lord's blood was shed for him long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All he has to do is ask God to give him faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once he believes, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should not ask the Lord to shed His blood for him or to redeem him from his sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, he should believe that Christ's blood has already been shed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once he believes, he is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true of our dealing with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not have to ask God to crucify our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Word says that the old man was crucified on the cross long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just as forgiveness and redemption are facts of the past, the crucifixion of the old man is also a fact of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through faith we see forgiveness as a work that is entirely of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same way, through faith we see the accomplishment of the crucifixion of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By faith we believe that the old man has been crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we look in the Greek text, we will see that the crucifixion of the old man is something that happened in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not enough to know this; we must believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By faith we see that the old man has died, and we should praise God, saying, "Praise God, I am already dead."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE OLD MAN CRUCIFIED, THE FLESH UNEMPLOYED</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once the old man is crucified, the body of sin is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The word annulled in the original Greek means "unemployed."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Originally, the job of the body of sin is to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The mouth slanders, and the mind engages itself in filthy thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when the old man dies, the mouth no longer slanders and the mind no longer wanders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, the mouth and the mind become unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though sin continues to urge us to sin, the old man is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The new life of the Lord within does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not like to sin, and as a result, the body becomes unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was a person in Tientsin who loved to play mahjong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His two hands were almost made for mahjong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But after he believed in the Lord, his two hands became unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul said that once the old man within is crucified, the body outside becomes unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The result is that one no longer sins and is no longer a slave to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though the sin within continues to tempt us and even though temptations continue, the old man is dead and no longer has any feeling or response.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the work of the cross as revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The work of the cross and the work of the blood are completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord's blood was shed by Him alone to remove our sins before God; we have no part in this work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But our crucifixion with Christ is different.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Crucifixion is not for dealing with sins but for eliminating the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First John 1:7 says, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible says that the blood of Christ washes us of our sins; it does not say that the blood washes away the old man, the self, or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These can only be dealt with by the cross Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These are not washed away by the blood; they are crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The flesh cannot be washed away by the blood; there is no way to wash it away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The filth on the outside can be washed away by the blood, but the flesh and the old man cannot be washed away; they can only be crucified by the cross 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every time the Bible speaks of crucifixion, it is in reference to the self and the old man, not to sins.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Sins must be washed away by the blood; the old man must be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the full salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In China opium is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even the sale of opium is illegal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Opium is a product of the opium factory.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our old man is like the opium factory which produces goods daily.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One can eliminate the opium, but as soon as it is eliminated more goods will come out of the factory.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our outward sins are washed away by the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But after they are washed away, the old man can produce more sins.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is why, in addition to the blood dealing with the sins that have been committed, there is a need for the cross to eliminate the old man that sins.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is not enough to eliminate the opium that is produced daily; one has to destroy the opium factory.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once the factory is destroyed, no opium will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Once the cross eliminates the old man, we will no longer sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What is the meaning of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the Jews rejected the Lord, the crowd cried, "Crucify!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Crucify!"</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>John 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then they said, "Take Him away!" v. 15 . The cross is a big taking away.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Jews took away the Lord by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Today the Lord is taking away our old man by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The blood is for redeeming us; the cross is for taking away the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After the old man is taken away, there is complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The blood is objective; it redeems us from the sins that are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The cross is subjective; it takes away the old man so that we can be released from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Everything hinges on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Everything has been accomplished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are already crucified with Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Perhaps we do not have the faith; perhaps there is doubt in our heart that there is such a thing: "I am still I. I do not feel like I am crucified." The sins of a sinner are washed away by the blood of the Lord as soon as he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Do you remember the story of how you were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If you believe now, you will praise God in a similar way, saying, "Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>My old man is dead!"</S>
