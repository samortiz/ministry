   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF PLIABLENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once a man is broken by the Holy Spirit, he will manifest a pliableness that comes from a fear of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When others contact him, they no longer will find him as hard, fierce, and severe as before.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Having been dealt with by the Lord, his voice becomes subdued, and his attitude becomes softened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He begins to fear God inwardly, and this fear spontaneously flows out through his attitude and words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Spontaneously, he becomes a pliable man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Easy to Be Dealt With</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is a pliable person?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A pliable person is one who is easy to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy for him to speak to others and easy for him to ask from others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a man is broken before God, it becomes easy even for him to make confessions and to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is very hard for some people to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that weeping has any merit in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But it does means that when a man has passed through God's dealing, his outward disposition, thoughts, emotion, and will are shattered, and it becomes easy for him to see his mistakes and to make confessions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It will not be difficult for others to talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The shell in him is broken, and his emotion and mind will have the capacity to accept others' opinions and to allow others to speak to him and teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will be brought into a new realm, and he will be able to receive help anytime and anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Easy to Have Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A pliable man is one who has sensitive feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because his outer man is broken, it is easy for his spirit to be released, and it is easy for him to touch the brothers' and sisters' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as their spirits move, he will sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His feelings become very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He immediately knows whether something is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as others' spirits move, he will respond.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will not do anything foolish or insensitive, and he will not do anything that offends others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We often carry on with things that others' spirits disapprove of.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We behave this way because our outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Others' spirits are sensitive about what we are doing, but we have no feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers and sisters often offer such tiresome prayers in the meetings that others wish they would stop, yet they keep on going.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirits of the others speak out and plead for them to stop, but they do not have any feeling in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The feelings of others do not produce any response in them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is because their outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man is broken, it is easy for his spirit to touch the spirits of others, and it is easy for him to feel what others feel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not act like an insensitive person who is ignorant of things that others are clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only those whose outer man is broken will know the meaning of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only they can touch the spirit of the Body, the feeling of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will no longer act or feel independently.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man is void of feelings, he will be like an artificial limb, perhaps a mechanical arm in a body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A mechanical arm can move with the body, but it is short of one thing feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people are members without feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The whole Body feels something, yet they do not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once the outer man is broken, a man will touch the conscience and feelings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His spirit will be open, and the church will easily touch his spirit and communicate its feelings to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a precious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time we are wrong, we will know that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the breaking of the outer man does not guarantee that we no longer will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It merely provides us with a faculty that tells us when we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The brothers and sisters may realize that we are wrong without opening their mouth to point this out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet as soon as we touch them, we realize that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as we touch their spirit, we know whether they are for or against the matter in question.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a basic requirement in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without this, there is no possibility of having the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Body of Christ does not arrive at a consensus through discussion and debates, just as there is no need for discussion in our own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every member spontaneously feels the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This common feeling is the will of the Body; it is also the will of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The will of the Head is expressed through the will of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As our outer man is broken, it will be easy for us to be adjusted, and it will be easy for us to have the feeling of the Body.</S>
