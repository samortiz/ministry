   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ORGANIZATION AS A CAUSE OF DAMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third item that has damaged the church throughout its history is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This damaging and corrupting element began to appear in the second century, largely through the influence of a certain spiritual leader, Ignatius, who taught that bishops were different from elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Scriptures, however, elders and bishops refer to the same people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The term elder denotes the person, whereas the term bishop, or overseer, denotes the function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament the elders oversee the various aspects of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The teaching that bishops are above elders prepared the way for the development of a hierarchy, with an elaborate organization that included bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The result was that the Holy Spirit was given no place in the so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for organization to be maintained, there is the need for regulations, forms, and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason these things have been prevailing in the so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Religion, knowledge, and organization have surely damaged the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even nominal Christians have some form of religion, although they have no experience of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, nearly all Christians, whether genuine believers or false professors, have some knowledge of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, organization abounds in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But very few Christians know the life-giving Spirit or the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that the lexicon used by most Christians does not include these terms, but includes only terms related to religion, knowledge, organization, regulations, forms, and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that we have escaped from all this!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are clear about the factors that have damaged and corrupted the church, we shall be kept from taking the old way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We shall give no place to religion, the tree of knowledge, or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE SEVENFOLD SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church life in the Lord s recovery we are not for organization with its emphasis on position or rank.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not wrong to speak of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in the book of Revelation there is no mention of these terms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This book speaks, on the contrary, of the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit that deals with the fallen, degraded church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not for doctrines, rituals, or rank we are for the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything apart from this all-inclusive Spirit is dung Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently, in a time of fellowship with the Lord, I had the sense that I was immersed in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Inwardly I was filled with the Spirit, and outwardly I was clothed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life consists in the corporate experience of the mingled Spirit, not in religion, doctrine, or organization with its titles, ranks, and positions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like Paul in Philippians 3, we count as dung everything other than Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>UNLOADED AND RELEASED</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the Lord, I know what my burden is today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not interested in teaching the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My burden is that we all be wrecked for Christ and the church, and that we be unloaded of the old things of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Lord s recovery we must go all the way back to the beginning, where there was the eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the beginning there was just the Word to feed us; there was no religion, no tree of knowledge, and no organization.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How we need to be unloaded of these three devilish factors of corruption and damage in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By the Lord s mercy, many of us have been unloaded, and others are being unloaded meeting after meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As I contact the saints, I realize that many have been fully released from religion, knowledge, and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we have been unloaded and released, we can be living and aggressive for Christ and the church wherever we may go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Having been unloaded, we are one, and we have brotherly love not as a doctrine, but as a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes people ask us if we speak in tongues or if we exercise the gifts of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can testify that we are filled, saturated, and possessed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this experience of the Spirit we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>IN THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we all be deeply impressed that the church life has nothing to do with religion, knowledge, or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church there is no room for regulations, forms, or rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not care even for the knowledge of the Bible in mere letters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To us, every word of the Bible must be spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the church will be living and preserved in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The life-giving Spirit is our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything we need for the church life is in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we come to the Holy Word, we need to exercise our spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the Word will become the Spirit in our experience, and we shall have the genuine and proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as we have the church life, we have everything: salvation, redemption, sanctification, the overcoming life, the rapture, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church life everything in time and eternity is ours.</S>
