<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE GROUP MEETINGS IN<br />
THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1>
<p>We need to realize that our present situation is very desperate. We have been speaking concerning the God-ordained way in both Taiwan and the United States for seven and a half years, but we have not seen a definite result. The word that we released has been more than clear, stressing that the group meeting is the crucial matter in the Lord&rsquo;s ordained way. We said that the group meetings should constitute eighty percent of the church life, and we also said that the gospel preaching, the nourishing, the cherishing, the feeding, and the perfecting should be done in the groups. But where are the groups, and where are the group meetings? We heard and received the word, and we even prayed much concerning this matter, but where is the definite building up of the groups? Among the churches there are some group meetings, but these are not the group meetings we intend to build up that can occupy eighty percent of the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUP MEETINGS BEING THE LIFE LINE<br />
OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>The group meetings are the life line of the God-ordained way. As long as we have not touched the group meetings, we have hardly begun to practice the God-ordained way. Satan has deceived us, just as the serpent deceived Eve, through the practice of Christianity to pay attention to big meetings. However, the New Testament makes it clear that the first stage of the Christian meetings was in the homes. According to Acts 2:46, on the day of Pentecost the believers met from house to house. This means that they met in homes, from home to home. The Greek phrase translated &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; implies that wherever there is a home of a Christian, there should be a meeting. In all the Christians&rsquo; homes, there should be meetings. Although I stressed this again and again, today we may still prefer to have big meetings. If we gather together only in big meetings, the proper church life will be hindered. When clumps of grass are scattered about, they grow and spread, but when they are piled together, they die. We may prefer to have the facade of a big meeting, but the Lord is not for that. The Lord is for His spreading, and His spreading is in the homes.</p>
<p>For any work among the saints, we need the group meetings. If it is not brought into the group meetings, even the work on the campuses will not be so adequate. It is good if we can lead many students to believe in the Lord, but they must be grouped together. Without the groups it will be difficult for them to remain, but if we have the groups, everything we do with them will be a success. However, in our work we may trust in many things, but we may not spend any of our strength to take care of the groups.</p>
<p>I fully realize that our barrenness is due mainly to the lack of the group meetings. If we do not have the group meetings, it will be difficult to overcome our barrenness. We may still have some increase, but the rate of increase will probably not be high, and the atmosphere in our meetings also will not be high. A large tree without branches cannot bear fruit. The big meetings are like the trunk of a tree, but a trunk alone cannot bear fruit. The trunk needs tender, fresh branches. It is the branches that can bear fruit. In the church life the branches are the groups. We should not be individualistic but should live in the Body. According to the New Testament, to live in the Body, we need the groups. This does not mean that we should group all the saints into one gathering. According to Acts, it means that we should group the saints together in home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING OUR WAY</h2>
<p>We need to take Haggai&rsquo;s word and consider our ways (Hag. 1:5, 7). We&mdash;especially the elders and the co-workers&mdash; need to reconsider our church life and our work. We need to consider what has been the result of our living day by day. We cannot allow ourselves to continue in our present way.</p>
<p>In the new localities in Southern California, the rate of increase was high initially. However, I found out that when the number attending the meetings in a locality reached one hundred, the rate of increase slowed considerably because the brothers there did not know how to go on. In the beginning they practiced the group meetings spontaneously, because the number was small. But gradually they grew out of the practice of the groups into the practice of having big meetings. The increase in those localities was reduced because they had only the big meetings without the proper group meetings.</p>
<p>I have given a number of messages presenting the principles and the detailed instructions on the practice of the group meetings, but until now I have not given you the steps on how to form the groups. I have been expecting day after day, month after month, and year after year for seven and a half years to see some of you rise up to do something organically to form the groups. However, I have not seen the result that I had hoped to see. Therefore, I feel burdened that I myself need to do something.</p><h2 class="head2">Finding a Way to Gain the Caucasian People</h2>
<p>After the recovery spreads to a certain nation, it should reach the typical local people. America was built up by the Caucasians. The recovery in the United States should reach the Caucasian people. If we cannot do this or we would not do this, we will suffer a big deficiency. God is not a respecter of persons (Acts 10:34). Nevertheless, we must find the remedy for our imperfect situation in gaining the Caucasians in a country such as the United States. When I came to the United States, I came with the strong determination not to work among the Chinese people. Although I love China and the Chinese people, the commission that I received of the Lord was not to come here to take care of the Chinese. I did not do any particular work among the Chinese in America until 1983. Shortly before that time the law in America was changed to increase the quota for the immigration of Chinese to twenty thousand per year from both Taiwan and mainland China. I realized that many Chinese had already come to America from Taiwan, and after they arrived here they became lost to the recovery. Abraham Chang proposed to me that we begin to take care of the Chinese immigrants. That was the beginning of the Chinese-speaking work in the United States. In view of our present situation, I feel that the Caucasian brothers must consider how to bring the Caucasian people into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we would not do this, it is a shame.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a thought deep within me that the reason we have gained so few Caucasians in recent years might be because in our meetings we have a high percentage of people of other races. We do not practice the separation of the races as some denominations do. Nevertheless, because this is the United States, the majority of the saints in the churches in this country should be Caucasian. The other races should be a minority. If the percentage of those of other races in the meetings is too high, it will be difficult for the Caucasian people to be attracted to the recovery. Therefore, we must find a way to get into the Caucasian community. We are healthy in our teaching, but we are not healthy in our practice. We must reconsider our situation. I would like to pay some price to gain the Caucasian people. All the Caucasian brothers and sisters need to be burdened and consider so that they may be enabled by the Lord to find a way.</p>
<p>Even among the Chinese-speaking people our fruit-bearing has not been satisfactory. The number of Spanish-speaking people in some of the churches in America also is not what it should be. Thus, we must reconsider our way.</p>
<p>Some of the Chinese saints went out for some time and did not get any fruit. Eventually, they concluded that the way of door knocking does not work. Please allow me to say that it is not the way of door knocking that does not work; it is that our door knocking is not persistent to the extent that the door knocking does work. If door knocking does not work, how could the Mormons and the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses have had a considerable success in door knocking? According to statistics, in the past century the rate of increase has been highest among these two heretical groups. The factor in their success is their door knocking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Finding the Proper Way<br />
to Group the Saints Together</h2>
<p>Because we have Caucasians, Chinese, Hispanics, Koreans, and other ethnic groups in the church life, we need to face a real problem that we do not have in other regions of the world, that is, how to group our people. We cannot take care of one ethnic group and neglect the others. We need to find a way to take care of the peoples of different races and ethnic origins. According to our present practice of grouping the races together, if we bring new Caucasians, especially middle-aged couples with children, to our meetings, they may be disappointed after just one meeting. They may decide that they do not like our kind of church and may then seek to find a church among the Caucasians. This is a real problem to us. Now we are going to have a new beginning. In our consideration concerning the way to form the groups, we must pay our attention mainly to the Caucasians. Our deficiency in gaining the Caucasians in the past might be because we grouped saints from other races with the Caucasians. It might be because of this that we have suffered a loss. In forming the groups, it may not be wise to group the Chinese-speaking and the Spanish-speaking saints with the Caucasian saints. Eventually, the environment surrounding us may compel us to group the Caucasians together and to charge them not to go to other races, but just to the Caucasian community to gain the Caucasians.</p>
<p>Another problem is this: after we gain the Caucasians, what will we bring them to? I would like to stir you up to consider these things. We also need to pray in a definite way for these things. We should not repeat vain prayers but should tell the Lord exactly what we want Him to do for His recovery. Realizing our situation, our environment, and the condition of our work, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, we do not have the wisdom. We do not know how to go on. We have come nearly to a standstill. With all the different races among us, how should we go on? We do not have the way. But one thing we do know: it is very difficult for us to gain the Caucasians, and it is even more difficult for us to retain them. We would like to know how to face the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although some Caucasians have been brought into our meetings, very few have remained. Some of the younger ones have remained, but in general the middle-aged ones do not remain. According to my observation, they do not feel that there is anything that interests them enough to cause them to stay. They have not arrived at the stage where they seek the Lord according to the deeper truth that we have released. What we have as treasures seem to be hidden in the earth. Although they may meet with us a number of times, they do not seem to see anything concerning these treasures. In our meetings we do not have the proper atmosphere or the way to present the treasures to them. There seems to be little in our meetings that can attract them or stir up their interest. I feel quite certain that the Caucasians should be contacted and taken care of by the Caucasians. This principle should be established among us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must reconsider our way. We cannot go on contentedly, remaining the same for another year. In the recovery today there is a real warfare, a real need. The way that we have seen is right. The problem is that within ourselves we are not clear concerning the practice. To speak of grouping the saints together is easy, but to find the proper way to form the groups and to carry them on is difficult. Thus, we need to pray for this. I hope that all the saints would bear a burden to pray for this. This is a great need among us today.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS<br />
IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1>
<p>I am very burdened for the church in Anaheim concerning the practice of the group meetings. In 1984 when I went to Taiwan, the first thing I touched was the group meetings. In my ministry regarding this matter I said that we can forget the heavens and the earth, but we must not forsake the group meetings. I also told all the churches that the church life depends eighty percent upon the group meetings.</p>
<p>The group meetings as a part of the God-ordained way are clearly unveiled in the New Testament. The church came into existence on the day of Pentecost. According to Acts 2:46, the newly saved believers immediately began to meet in their homes. Acts 2:46 uses the phrase <em>from house to house.</em> According to the Greek, this phrase means that the believers met by houses, taking the house as the basic unit for their meeting. This implies that wherever there was a home of a believer, there was a meeting. The number of homes was the same as the number of the believers&rsquo; meetings. Thus, the New Testament indicates that each one of us should have a meeting in our home. Of course, these home meetings should not be just with our own family; they should also include others. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles indicate that in some localities the church met in a home (Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2).</p>
<p>The New Testament also shows us that in addition to having the group meetings in homes, the entire church should also come together in one place (1 Cor. 14:23). These two kinds of meetings&mdash;the group meetings in the homes and the meetings in which the whole church comes together in one place&mdash;are like the two wings of an airplane. With only one wing on one side, an airplane cannot fly. The group meetings in the homes are one &ldquo;wing,&rdquo; and the coming together of the whole church is the other. However, we need to see that the group meetings are more basic. Without the group meetings it is difficult to have the increase of the church. Without the members brought in through the group meetings, we could not have the coming together of the whole church. Although the church in Anaheim has been in existence since 1974, the number in the English-speaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day is approximately one hundred fifty. This number is too small. The lack of increase among us is due mainly to the shortage of the group meetings in the saints&rsquo; homes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR DESPERATE NEED TO PRACTICE<br />
THE GROUP MEETINGS IN A NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Over a period of more than seven years I gave a number of messages on the practice of the group meetings (see <em>The Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way,</em> Messages Twenty-three through Thirty, and <em>The Practice of the Group Meetings,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). In these messages I gave the word from the Bible to convey the vision and the revelation concerning this matter. I also gave detailed instructions on how to carry out the group meetings. During this period of time I did not do anything directly to begin the practice of the group meetings because I fully expected that a number of the saints would rise up and do this. I had the assurance that the elders, the co-workers, and the seeking saints would take the points of my speaking and come together to practice and learn the way to carry out the group meetings. All these saints are very capable; if they would do it, surely they would have a success. Although I have been waiting to see this in Anaheim since April 1989, according to the present situation, nearly no one has risen up to practice the group meetings in the new way. Some of the saints do have a kind of group meeting, but those meetings are carried out in the old way. Those meetings do serve a certain purpose, but I must say that that way is not prevailing. That is not the way shown in the Bible. Our desperate need today is to practice the new group meetings in the new way. Without this it is very difficult for us to go on by gaining the increase.</p>
<p>To practice the God-ordained way we need the group meetings. I am happy that a good number of saints have remained faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery over the past eight years of my ministry on the God-ordained way. However, the churches need &ldquo;new blood,&rdquo; that is, new members. The only way to gain the new members for the church is through group meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING BY DOING</h2>
<p>I realize that many of the saints have the desire to practice the group meetings in the new way, but they have not done so because they feel that they do not know how to do it. However, I would say that they do not know how to do it because they do not do it. If they would do it, they would know how to do it. It is a fact that we know how to do things by doing them. If we do not touch a certain thing, we will not know it. When we get into that thing, we know it. There are many common and ordinary things that we do not know how to do simply because we never did those things. If we would do them, we would learn by doing.</p><h2 class="head1">FORMING THE GROUPS BY THE WAY OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>I have the burden to teach you the details concerning the forming of the groups and the practice of the group meetings just as an English teacher would teach his students the ABCs. However, I cannot do this with the whole church. I do not think that the whole church is ready for this. But I believe that some of the saints are ready.</p>
<p>To form the groups in the new way there is no need to touch any of the existing church meetings or group meetings. We can let them go on as they have been, without attempting to change or to terminate them. If you desire to start a group meeting, you should first pray. You should not do anything without praying first. You should do everything by prayer and do everything according to prayer. In your prayer, you may say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am burdened to have a group meeting. Lord, give me the people. I cannot have the group meeting by myself. I need at least a few.&rdquo; To form a group, you do not need a large number; even three to five saints are enough. After you pray to the Lord, the Lord may tell you to go to fellowship with a certain brother. While you are on your way to contact this brother, you should pray, &ldquo;Lord, what should I say to him?&rdquo; Do everything by prayer; this makes a difference.</p>
<p>If the brother agrees to join you, you should still pray, &ldquo;Lord, what shall we do? My brother desires to join me. What shall we do?&rdquo; In such a situation you should pray and not dominate the other brother by telling him what to do. Rather, you should ask him, &ldquo;Now that you have expressed your desire to join me, what shall we do?&rdquo; The other brother may propose that the two of you come together to pray and fellowship the next day. From the time that he says he will join you and you answer him by asking him what you should do, the two of you will be organically united in the Spirit. Your relationship will be different from what it was before. Immediately the Holy Spirit will confirm this, making the two of you one. The two of you will love each other more than ever. Then you will learn of him and he will learn of you.</p>
<p>After you pray together, in a few days the Lord may lead you both to contact a third brother. Through your prayerful contact with him, he may agree to join you. Now you have a group of three. I can assure you that if you form your group in this way, everyone who joins your group will immediately become one with you organically.</p>
<p>Do not do anything according to the natural concept. Do everything according to prayer. The Lord may lead you to contact another one. This one may live somewhat far away from you, and you may tell the Lord that he lives too far away. However, that is your concept. Instead of going according to your concept, you should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading through your prayer. Within a week or ten days, you may contact four or five saints who agree to join you in a group. This way of grouping together is different from the way of arrangement or assignment by the elders, and it is also different from the way of forming groups according to geography or neighborhood. Actually, both the way of prayer and the way of arrangement are needed in order to have the proper forming of the groups. In later messages I will say more concerning the way to form the groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING OURSELVES TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR GROUP</h2>
<p>Before getting four or five, you may have gotten two or three already. You two or three should come together and pray and get to know each other. Although you may have met in the same church for years, you may not know how many children each other has. Furthermore, you may not know that the wife of one of the brothers has been ill for a considerable time. If you had been practicing the proper grouping, within one hour after one of the group members became ill, you would have known it. In grouping together, the first thing to do is to know one another. Whenever you come together, you should ask concerning the present situation of each group member. We may say that we know each other, but actually we do not. When one of our family members is sick, we may avoid telling others. We may say that everyone in our family is well, when actually some are not well. Instead of opening our situation to one another, we hide things from one another.</p>
<p>After opening to one another concerning our present situation, we should pray for one another and care for and help one another. This is a further step in the practice of the group meetings. Because we do not open ourselves to one another and do not have the mutual care for one another, we have lost our impact. If you will practice the new way, immediately you will have the impact. After forming a group, you should not go the next day to visit people by knocking on new doors. Rather, the group members should pray together. The Lord is living, and He is real. He is with us; but He is not with us in the old way. In the old way He is not living and He is not real to us, because we do not practice His organic way. When we come together to fellowship, we still do not fully open ourselves to one another. Thus, there has been little result from our fellowship. It seems that the Lord is not with us, or that He is with us only partially. Yes, the Lord is gracious, and He is broad. He takes care of us, but that does not mean that He is happy with us. He is happy with us to the extent that we open ourselves to our fellow members.</p>
<p>Because we have never opened ourselves to our fellow members, we have very little impact. When you go out to knock on doors, even the unbelievers can sense that between the two or three of you there are some problems. There is no need for you to tell them; they can sense that you have problems. That reduces your impact. But if you are really one, the unbelievers can sense this also. They may say to themselves, &ldquo;How marvelous that these three people are one. In my whole life I have never seen such a thing.&rdquo; That is the impact. With such oneness and impact, surely the unbelievers will make the decision within themselves that they would like to join themselves to you. Perhaps they will not understand clearly what you preach to them, but after you leave they may say to one another, &ldquo;These people are sincere. They speak what they believe, and they speak what they are.&rdquo; After the day of Pentecost the believers did not deliberately practice communism. To do so would have been a shame to them. However, they had everything in common (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32) in order to show the entire universe, including the demons, the angels, the Lord, and Satan, that they were truly one. Spontaneously, the impact was there (5:12-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING OUR WAY<br />
TO VISIT PEOPLE FOR THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We need to adjust our way in baptizing the new ones. After getting a new one saved, you should not baptize him immediately. Furthermore, if possible you should avoid baptizing him in a bathtub. To baptize people in a bathtub is neither stately nor dignified. I admit that this is different from what I taught in the past. I told you from the beginning that I am like one who is experimenting in a laboratory. I am studying in order to learn the proper way to practice the God-ordained way. Based on our former practice in Taipei, we learned that our way of baptizing people quickly should be reconsidered. There we baptized so many people that we could not take care of them adequately. It is not normal for a mother to have fifteen children in the same delivery. In Taipei we attempted to baptize as many people as we could in the shortest amount of time. Eventually, we baptized thirty-eight thousand people, but we might have lost thirty-five thousand of these because they were not taken care of as they should have been. We found out that this kind of practice was ineffective. If seven hundred saints had baptized only three thousand people in a period of eighteen months, surely they could have cared adequately for each new one.</p>
<p>After praying in seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading to form your group, you need to pray much concerning whom you should visit for the gospel. I believe the Holy Spirit will lead you to take care of your closest friends and relatives first. You need to pray also concerning who among the three or five companions in your group should go with you to contact your friends and relatives. The Lord will lead you.</p>
<p>When you go out to contact people for the first time, you should not speak to them much concerning the Lord. If you speak too much concerning the Lord or the Bible, they may think that you are too religious. They may not like to be as religious as you are. During the first few times of contact, you should become acquainted with them and make friends with them. After two or three times the Spirit may lead you by giving you the feeling that they have accepted you. Then you can open to them something concerning the Lord. Even at that time you should not ask them too quickly to pray. Wait until the next time. Proceed slowly, step by step. If after forming a group you could get one person saved within one month, how marvelous that would be.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your mercy. Thank You that You have exposed us, that You have shown us our shortage, and that You have shown us what You need. Lord, we thank You for all these things, yet we are still ignorant concerning the proper experience of the group meetings. Today we are still looking to You. Show us Your way. Show us how to face the situation and how to meet the need at the present time. We need Your wisdom. We do not like to do anything by ourselves, by our wisdom, or on our own. We are in fear and trembling before You. We do not like to speak anything by ourselves. Lord, save us and rescue us from making mistakes. We do not like to be misled. Lord, cover us against all the devices of the evil one. We desire to be preserved, and we desire to be kept. Lord, cover us and give us a clear understanding and an open spirit without any prejudice or hint of opinion. We do not like to be opinionated. Lord, cover us from all these things that we may have a clear, pure, and even purified fellowship so that You can show us Your way. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY CONCERNING THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In this message I will fellowship a few points which we have seen from history. The New Testament shows us clearly that in the beginning of the church life the meetings were first in the homes (Acts 2:46; 5:42). The fact that the saints were meeting in their homes indicates strongly that they met together in groups. There was a group in every home. The larger gatherings were needed, but the larger gatherings were not a daily need. The daily need was the group meetings.</p>
<p>The record in the New Testament does not make the group meetings as definite as what is being revealed to us today. The reason for this may be that the divine revelation is always released after the experiences of God&rsquo;s people. First comes the experience of God&rsquo;s people; then God&rsquo;s revelation follows. There is no example in the entire Bible of God&rsquo;s revelation coming before the experience of His people. God called Abraham, but if Abraham had not gone on, the divine revelation would not have come to him. All the revelations in the Bible came as God&rsquo;s people went on in their experience. Because Abel, Enoch, and Noah went on with God, God was able to reveal something through each of them.</p>
<p>At the close of the New Testament the church had existed on the earth for less than a century. The last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, was written in approximately A.D. 90. At that time the church had not experienced very much, so the revelation stopped there. However, according to the record in the heavens, the book of Acts is still going on; it has never stopped. After the book of Acts, many centuries of church history have passed. In all the going on of the church we can see something further.</p>
<p>When Brother Nee was raised up, he started the first church meeting in 1922. That first church meeting was surely a small group. I was not there in the first ten years of our history in the recovery, from 1922 to 1932, but when I came into the work, Brother Nee purposely told me the details concerning those ten years. In the first four or five years the number attending the meetings was increasing. This increase was due to the spontaneous practice of the group meetings. In the beginning there was not a large meeting. But after ten years the situation changed. From 1927 through 1932 the church in Shanghai grew in size to about one hundred. After the number reached one hundred, the rate of increase became very low.</p>
<p>In 1933 I began to serve in Shanghai. Eventually, Brother Nee committed to me the responsibility for the church and the work. On the one hand, I was very busy, but on the other hand, from today&rsquo;s point of view, I was not very busy. First of all, I gave a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. At that time the main thing was the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting. If the message was good, the meeting would be a success; if the message was not good, the meeting would be a failure. Thank the Lord, to some extent the messages I gave were a success. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning I gave a message. The people and Brother Nee were happy. I also was happy. When I was young, I put my whole being into my speaking. Today I cannot speak in such a way. At that time I did not need a microphone. I would speak for an hour and ten minutes, and my whole being would be exhausted. Consequently, I needed the entire next day to rest. Therefore, on Mondays I was quite free.</p>
<p>The second thing I did was to take care of the weekly meetings, mainly the prayer meeting and a brothers&rsquo; fellowship meeting. The brothers&rsquo; fellowship meeting was for the practice of 1 Corinthians 14. Because all the brothers were priests, the meeting had no chairman or clergy. Even though I was not charged to take the lead in that meeting, I still was there unconsciously taking the lead.</p>
<p>The third thing I did was to visit people. Although I rarely went out to visit people, and people rarely came to fellowship with me, I did visit, fellowship, and contact the saints on occasion. I also took care of the correspondence.</p>
<p>By studying the past history and our present situation, I have realized that if we had had the way of the group meetings in 1933, we could have gained several times as many people as we gained at that time. This would have made us very busy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE<br />
MEETING LIFE IN MAINLAND CHINA<br />
AND THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS<br />
IN TAIWAN FROM 1949 TO 1954</h2>
<p>According to our history, whenever a church reached an attendance of one hundred, the rate of increase became reduced. The reason for this is that after attaining that number, the principle of meeting in groups was annulled. We began to trust in the big meetings and began to do everything to support, maintain, enrich, and uplift the big meetings. Everything was for the big meetings. This is absolutely against the biblical principle. The increase does not come through the big meetings. When there is a very good, spiritual speaker, the attendance in the big meetings will increase. But any Christian body that depends on such a speaker will suffer quite a loss when that speaker dies. That is not the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>In mainland China, before I went to Taiwan we did not have group meetings. We did call some smaller meetings &ldquo;home meetings,&rdquo; but in actuality they were not group meetings. After we began the work in Taiwan, we began to practice the group meetings very much. When we first went to the island of Taiwan from mainland China, the number of saints throughout the island was from three to five hundred. However, in just five years, from 1949 to 1954, the total number of saints on the island reached forty thousand. It was at that juncture that Brother T. Austin-Sparks was invited to visit us. During his visit a few of the young co-workers under my training were negatively influenced by him. This caused a turmoil among us. After the turmoil, in approximately 1958, the practice of group meetings nearly ceased, and the rate of increase was much reduced. The rate of increase that we experienced from 1949 to 1954 has never been regained, even until today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORMING THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We all must realize that our destiny depends upon how to have group meetings. If we do not practice the group meetings, our rate of increase will remain very low. We may be busy in many things each day, even with meetings here and there, but it will mostly be in vain because the increase will be less than about ten percent a year. This is the reason that we must endeavor to form the group meetings.</p>
<p>From now on I will practice my work in a way very different from the way I practiced in the past seven and a half years. In those years, I was the coach, giving instructions to the saints and teaching the principles and never practicing myself. But as I have observed the situation, I have realized that if I do not practice, it will be difficult for us to have a definite beginning. I look to the Lord very much that He will give us a new start.</p>
<p>This new practice will not conflict with the present church life or with the present way. The saints do not need to stop going to the prayer meeting or the other meetings. They should still keep going to all the regular meetings. But in addition to the regular meetings of the church, there is the need for some to pick up the burden and form new groups.</p>
<p>To form the new groups, first you should pray, asking the Lord to give you a companion. If you pray, the Lord may lead you to go to the brother sitting next to you. As you go to him and tell him of your intention, the Spirit may confirm your work and inspire him to join you. Then the two of you will become a group. The first thing the two of you must do in your group meeting is to get yourselves closely joined in spirit and in your environment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF INTIMATE FELLOWSHIP,<br />
PRAYER, AND VISITING OTHERS<br />
IN THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In the church life today we often pretend that we know each other. Truthfully speaking, I do not know many of the saints. I do not know the names of many of the saints. In some cases, I know the first name, but I do not know the last name. I may know the names of certain saints, but I do not know how many children they have. This illustrates the fact that we do not have a close, thorough fellowship with one another. We must pick up the burden to form the group meetings in a new way. First, according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading, you must get a few companions. You and your companions must get to know each other thoroughly. You must know each companion&rsquo;s age, the name of his wife, the number and ages of his children, the schools the children attend, and so forth. In other messages I pointed out that the first thing in the group meeting is fellowship so that all the members of the group may know each other in an up-to-date way.</p>
<p>The wife of a certain brother may be sick in bed, but not many of the saints may be aware of this because we do not have the fellowship in a group meeting. If we were in a group meeting, the first thing I would ask is how the other members of the group are doing. In the past we concealed our real situation, not letting others know what our situation was. We covered our real situation and pretended to be something else. By such a practice we deceived ourselves, and we also deceived others. As a result, we did not know each other&rsquo;s situation. We pretended to know each other; actually, we remained separate. In this kind of situation it is impossible to be in one accord with the real impact. This was the reason that when we went out to visit people, they could easily realize that we were not one. To have the one accord and the impact, we must intimately know one another through fellowship.</p>
<p>In forming a group, the first step is to get a companion. The second step is to pray together and fellowship together in order to know each other in a thorough and intimate way. You may pray, &ldquo;Lord, what is the next step that You want us to take?&rdquo; When you ask the Lord such a question, I assure you that He will not tell you to go out and visit people. I say this based on my study of the new way in the past seven and a half years. If you met with your companion last night, and you meet together again this morning, the first thing to do is to let your companion know what happened to you between last night and this morning. In this way, you and your companion maintain a thorough knowledge of each other. As a result, you will become one, and a real love and care will come in between you. The Lord may then lead you to get four or five additional companions.</p>
<p>After this, the Lord may lead you to pray for a period of time. At this time do not go out; just pray. After praying for two weeks, you may be ready, and the Lord may lead you to go out to visit people. During the period of prayer, you should pray, asking the Lord to lead you to the ones whom you should visit. The Lord may lead you to study not only your own relatives, cousins, in-laws, neighbors, classmates, friends, and colleagues, but also the close acquaintances of the other members of the group. The Lord will show you the ones who need to be visited. This is to knock on warm doors. In going, do not go by yourself or according to your feeling. You should not go according to your decision; rather, you should go by the group. At most, two or three from your group should go, but in order to find out who should go, you need to study your candidates and pray.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The instructions I am giving now concerning the new way are different from what I spoke in Taiwan. In Taiwan I charged you to visit people and to get them baptized immediately. But today I do not encourage you to get people baptized in a quick way. Also, when you visit people, do not speak too quickly to them concerning the Bible, God, Christ, or salvation. If you do, people may think that you are too religious and that they cannot come up to your standard. They may be turned away by your enthusiasm. In your first visit with someone who has been recommended to you, do not stay very long; the shorter the visit, the better. A short visit will give the one who is visited a good taste, so that he will welcome another visit. Do not spoil the taste of those whom you visit. On the first visit, do not speak too much concerning spiritual things.</p>
<p>As you visit a second or third time, you may begin to say something concerning Christ. You may need to go a few times before you are able to get a person saved. The principle is: the slower, the better; the slower it is, the safer it is. The slower the pace is, the more certain it is that you can gain that person.</p>
<p>We have said that if we could get one real fruit in a year through our contact, that would be a great matter. It may even be possible to get one person every three months. Generally speaking, one gained in this way may be steady.</p>
<p>Baptism also should not be done in a quick way. Try to avoid baptizing people in a bathtub. This does not mean that it should not be done at all; it depends on the situation. Actually, any place where there is water&mdash;a baptismal tank, a bathtub, a pool, a river, or the sea&mdash;is good for baptizing people, but when you go out to visit people in a regular way, you do not need to baptize people in their bathtubs in a hurry.</p>
<p>When a new one is saved, it may be best not to speak to him immediately concerning the church. You should continue to meet with him in his home or in your group meeting. Then, as the Lord leads, speak with him about the church and bring him to the church meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPECIAL MEETINGS FOR NEW ONES</h2>
<p>I would also propose that, if possible, the church set up special meetings for the new ones periodically, one for the Caucasians, another for the Chinese-speakers, and another for the Spanish-speakers. You can bring your new ones to the special meetings. Several groups can bring their new ones to such a meeting. In that special meeting, the first thing to do is to give them a short message concerning baptism and baptize the new ones. Because they are baptized in a baptistry with a number of people surrounding them, they will feel very stately. There should be a joyful celebration with many praises to the Lord for their baptism. Everyone should shake hands with the newly baptized ones. After this you can have the Lord&rsquo;s table with all the baptized ones and fellowship with them about the Lord&rsquo;s table. If we practice in this way, we will surely be able to bring Caucasians into the church life.</p>
<p>In the practice of the group meetings, as much as possible the Caucasian saints should not be grouped together with the Chinese saints. Even someone who is not Caucasian by race may be Caucasian in principle because either he was born in America, he speaks typical American English, or his spouse is Caucasian. This is only a principle; it is not absolute. Whatever way allows us to have a success, we will take that way. In principle, all the Caucasian brothers and sisters should group with Caucasians. They should go to visit Caucasians, not Chinese or Spanish. The rate of increase among the Chinese may be higher than among the Caucasians. For example, we may be able to gain ten new ones among the Chinese within two weeks, but it may take three months to gain two Caucasians. Still, this labor is worthwhile. Let the Chinese saints group with the Chinese and go to visit the Chinese. Let the Spanish saints visit the Spanish, and let the Korean saints visit the Koreans.</p>
<p>In a larger church that has a Chinese-speaking meeting, there should also be a Chinese baptism meeting in the way that I described earlier. In the beginning, such a meeting may not take place every week. But eventually, such a special meeting for baptism and the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s table with the new ones should be conducted every week. In a place where there is only one baptistry, the different meetings by the different groups could be scheduled for different times. Of course, this is just a general idea; for the details we need to pray.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING<br />
IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11). For the long run the group meetings may need special, spiritual shepherding or teaching. After a few months one group may increase to more than fifteen. At that time the group can divide into two groups. All the brothers who formed the group initially can teach and shepherd, but we cannot expect that the new ones will be able to go very fast. Therefore, we must consider the need for shepherding and teaching. Eventually, when we have many groups, there will be a great need for shepherds and teachers. We must study the situation and pray very much about the coming days.</p>
<p>When the number of group meetings is very large, the care for the groups cannot be done in a general way. Although I hate to use the word <em>leaders,</em> after much consideration, I find it difficult to avoid the need for leaders. According to our present practice, we have only elders, but if the number of groups in a locality grows to be a big number, the relatively small number of elders will not be able to take care of the entire church.</p>
<p>In the long run there will be a great need, but at the present time we must take the initial step to form the groups in a simple way. In the new start with the group meetings, the remaining aspects of the church&rsquo;s present practice can remain the same. While we are practicing the new group meetings, we should still maintain the regular meetings of the church.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICING THE GROUPS<br />
WITH MUCH CONSIDERATION,<br />
PRAYER, AND LABOR</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You that You are the source, and You are our Master. We can come to You at any time to seek Your supply. We do need Your supply. Up to the present moment, we need Your supply so that we may know how to form the groups step by step and how to build them up, how to have everything increasing to be eighty percent of the church life. Lord, teach us and guide us, even in our fellowship with one another. Show us the way. This morning we trust in You for this matter. We still need more leading, more guidance. We need Your light, and we need Your revelation. We do not like to do anything that is seemingly right, yet still so natural, out of our self-concept. Lord, deliver us from all these things. We desire to follow You to perform the Father&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s economy, and to take care of the growth in life, to have the real spirituality. Lord, we do not like to be an unturned cake, but we do not know how to turn to the other side. Lord, help us. We need You in every detail. We need You to deliver us from trusting in ourselves. We do not like to have any trust in ourselves. We are fearful of this. Lord, we tremble before You that we might do something seemingly new yet altogether against You. Lord, defeat the enemy; he is busy. Whenever You do something, he is busy. We need Your wisdom to be aware of all his doings. Lord, destroy the enemy&rsquo;s work, the work of darkness, the work of the spiritual forces in the air. Rebuke Your enemy and shame him, and bind all the evil spirits. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br />
WHILE TAKING CARE OF OUR BACKGROUND<br />
AND OUR PRESENT SITUATION</h2>
<p>We may think that it is easy for us to form the groups, but actually it is not easy. This is the reason that we have hardly begun to practice the group meetings, although we have been speaking concerning the groups for a considerable time. It may be easy to contact some other saints and to get some companions, but it is not easy to form a group and to make it effective so that it can carry out the functions of producing, nourishing, and perfecting.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we have a very particular background. The recovery has been with us for more than seventy years. The Lord has shown us many things, and He has brought us into many situations and through many different kinds of experiences. We not only have such a background, but now in the recovery there are more than twelve hundred churches around the globe. We cannot go on to take the new way as we have seen it, and yet forget our background and our present situation. On the one hand, we must find a way to take care positively of the formation of the groups, and on the other hand, we must find a way to care for the background and the present situation.</p>
<p>In Anaheim there is a church with approximately three hundred active members, including those in the English-speaking, Chinese-speaking, and Spanish-speaking meetings. If we are absolute and desperate to consecrate ourselves to the Lord for the new way, and especially for the present step of forming the groups, yet we forget about the present situation, that is wrong. We cannot simply set aside the present situation and do something separate.</p>
<p>Our background is not a light or superficial background, because for many years we have paid attention to seeking the Lord, knowing Him, experiencing Him, living Him, growing in Him, and having Him increased and magnified in us. From the very beginning we were led by the Lord in this way, and we have never deviated from this kind of seeking. This is our background of spirituality. In addition, we have a further, deeper background; that is, we take care of God&rsquo;s economy to have everything for the building up of His organism, the church. God desires to have the church, and we are endeavoring to reach His goal. Very few Christians take care of the church. Most Christians only take care of their work. Many Christians use worldly methods to promote and carry out their work. However, it is impossible to walk in the spirit and still be involved with worldly things. In Romans 8:4 Paul said that we must do everything according to our spirit. It is impossible to engage in worldly practices and still be according to our spirit. Other Christian groups may have large gatherings in which they use worldly attractions to please people. That is an action that does not take care of spirituality. We cannot do that. We do desire to gain the increase, but we do not want to bring forth children by incest. We do not want to produce Ammonites and Moabites (Gen. 19:30-38). We may get people saved by employing worldly means, but these saved ones may be Ammonites or Moabites. The Ammonites and Moabites were not allowed to enter into the holy congregation for ten generations (Deut. 23:3).</p>
<p>We need to learn the lesson. For more than seventy years the Lord has been keeping us from all kinds of pollution and defilement. We cannot go on quickly or easily, because we must take care of spirituality, the church life, the church ground, the oneness of the Body, and many other things. Therefore, on the one hand, we must take the new way, the God-ordained way, as the Lord has revealed it to us, and on the other hand, while we are going forward we must take care of our background, our present situation, and the many churches around the globe.</p>
<p>After much consideration before the Lord, I feel led by the Lord to the conclusion that while we are endeavoring to take the new way, we should not change anything of the present situation. We should not change our present way of conducting the children&rsquo;s meeting, the young people&rsquo;s work, the prayer meeting, and the existing group meetings. However, besides caring for all the things of the existing local churches, the full-time elders and co-workers can devote more of their time to help the saints take the new way. While they endeavor to practice the God-ordained way, they should still participate in all the different aspects of the work, including even the existing group meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION OF THE NEW GROUPS</h2>
<p>The formation of the new groups will require a great deal of prayer, and it will also require much laboring. The denominations depend on their activities, and the Pentecostals depend on their superstitious trust in the Holy Spirit. Both are wrong. The apostle Paul saw the Lord Himself (1 Cor. 2:9; 15:8), and he also received the Spirit (Acts 9:17). He received more divine revelations than all the other apostles. For this reason the Lord gave him a thorn to cause him not to be proud (2 Cor. 12:7). Nevertheless, in 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul told us that he labored more abundantly than all the other apostles, and in Colossians 1:28-29 he said that he labored, struggling according to God&rsquo;s operation which operated within him in power. The Greek words for <em>labor</em> and <em>struggle</em> were used in reference to athletes who contended in the Olympic games. All the athletes who contend in the games must labor and struggle. Paul was one who labored, struggled, and contended in carrying out his ministry. Therefore, we should not think that it is easy to form a group meeting. In fact, it is not easy. The result of our work depends on how much we labor. If we do not labor, nothing will be produced.</p>
<p>In seeking a partner to form a group, you should not select someone according to your natural preference. Instead, you should pray and wait. You need to pray for a few days, perhaps even for one or two weeks, waiting on the Lord to give you a proper partner. After you get one, the two of you need to pray yourselves into the oneness. You need to pray yourselves into the proper, spiritual, heavenly intimacy. Then, in order to carry out the group meetings, you need another four or five group members. To select these additional members also requires much prayer and labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR LABOR AND STUDY<br />
TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</h2>
<p>After the formation of the group is completed, the members should not go out immediately to knock on doors. This was our practice in the past, but it did not work out well. All the members of the group need to work together as one person. For this they need to come together to pray: &ldquo;Lord, You lead us. You show us to whom we should go to knock on their doors.&rdquo; If you will pray, the Lord will lead you first to study all the acquaintances of each group member, including their relatives, neighbors, friends, classmates, and colleagues. Make a list of them and study things such as their temperament, their character, and their family situation. By doing this you will surely gain a clear view of those to whom you should go. Then you can contact them. Since they are your acquaintances, it may seem that it is easy to contact them. However, you need to find a way to contact them properly. Before you go to visit the first acquaintance, you may need to study his situation for a considerable length of time.</p>
<p>In the entire world, especially in the United States, all the merchants must compete in order to make money. They study others&rsquo; markets, prices, and merchandise so that they can find a way to attract buyers and make a profit. In Luke 19 the Lord likened our work to doing business. In verse 13 He said, &ldquo;Do business until I come.&rdquo; According to the parable given there by the Lord (vv. 12-27), we need to use the &ldquo;capital&rdquo; that He has given us to gain a profit for Him. However, in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s work, many believers are lazy. They do not labor, yet they still expect to make a profit. In the Lord&rsquo;s work we take things too easily. However, no worthwhile endeavor is easy. Even to make a decision concerning whom to visit for the gospel requires a number of days&rsquo; study.</p>
<p>In the past I said that one-third of the saints in a local church should go out regularly to contact people for the gospel, and that by doing this consistently they could expect to bear three remaining fruits yearly. If this could be realized, the churches would double each year. If we labor in this way fifty-two weeks a year, we should easily gain three remaining ones for the Lord in a year. However, if we take it easy and do not labor, we may not gain one remaining fruit in ten years. If we labor a little, but labor wrongly, we still will not bear remaining fruit.</p>
<p>Some of the saints may take my word concerning the groups and attempt to practice it, but after a short time their practice may not have a positive result and they may become disappointed. The probable reason for their failure is that they did not labor. Some businessmen are able to make money, while others are not. Many businessmen invest a great deal of time and money to improve their business. In order to do business internationally, many businessmen, especially those from the Far East, expend considerable effort to learn other languages so that they can communicate with those in other nations and export their goods abroad. Because of their labor, they have become very successful. However, when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s work, we may take it easy. When we do not labor, we will not see a proper result. Merchants labor because they are desperate; that is their livelihood. However, we are not desperate. Whether we gain one this year or do not gain one, we can still live; we can still come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to enjoy the Lord. If we do not bear one remaining fruit in five years, that does not seem to concern us; but if a businessman does poorly even for half a year, he may have to close his doors. I would like to impress you with the fact that the people of the world are busy, but in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s work, many of the saints are not busy. The worldly people are industrious, but many of us are not.</p>
<p>If you would labor according to my word, you will see the result. When you go out to knock on doors, a good number of doors will be open to you. You will not go to the doors in vain. Before going you must study the situation very much. You need to consider what to say the first time you contact someone, and what to speak the second time. It is not adequate to merely take with you a copy of <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> and speak the same thing to everyone whom you contact. You should not pray and study by yourself but should study with your group as a unit. After studying together, you should go to contact people. If you take this way, it will be easy to gain the increase; the increase is assured.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FINDING THE PROPER WAY TO CARE FOR THE NEW ONES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Preparing the Proper Materials<br />
for the Group Meetings</h2>
<p>Once we gain some new ones, we need to study to find the way to take care of them. I have been considering what materials would be the best to use in the group meetings to teach people. We have both <em>Life Lessons</em> and <em>Truth Lessons.</em> Although these lessons are very well written, I feel that they are not so suitable, because they may be too much for the new ones to digest. Even <em>The Holy Word for Morning Revival</em> may not be suitable for the new ones in the group meetings. It is not good to feed people too much food; we need to give them the proper portions. In Hebrews 5:12-14 Paul mentioned two kinds of food: milk and solid food. We should not attempt to nourish a child with solid food. Hence, we need someone to labor in order to write some suitable materials for the group meetings that will nourish the new ones with milk. In order to have the profitable teaching and fellowship in the group meetings, some materials that can serve as a guideline are needed. I hope that some of the brothers will be raised up by the Lord to compose some proper writings for the group meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing the New Ones to the Church Meetings</h2>
<p>According to our present situation, we need to consider what would be the best time for us to bring the new ones to the church meetings. We all need to study to find out when the new ones should be brought to the church meetings. Because we have our present situation and our particular background, for the new ones&rsquo; benefit it may be better not to bring them to the church meetings for a period of time. After meeting in the groups for some time, they should be somewhat built up. Then we can consider and study whether or not we should bring them to the church meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Carrying Out the Teaching of the Truth<br />
in the Group Meetings</h2>
<p>Another problem is how to carry out the teaching of the truth in the group meetings. We need to find a way to carry out the teaching year after year for those who continue in the group meetings, and at the same time take care of the new ones who are saved and brought into the groups month after month. It is not adequate to prepare lessons for just one year and then repeat them year after year. After a group finishes a series of lessons, they will need a way to continue. In addition, new ones will be brought in continually. We will need a way to teach them also. The matter of human education has been studied by mankind for six thousand years. Today nearly the entire world has adopted the same kind of educational system. However, the way of human education cannot be applied directly to the church life. Therefore, we need to study to find a proper way to teach the truth in the group meetings.</p>
<p>The human life is not merely one generation; it is generation after generation. Eventually, in the group meetings we will have different generations meeting together. Each generation must be properly cared for. This problem may not appear in the first generation of the group meetings, but eventually another generation will come up, and we will have to face this situation of how to care for the group meetings with the different generations.</p>
<p>I have mentioned all these matters to show that we will need much preparation for what is ahead. Through the group meetings we will no doubt gain the increase. However, we need to labor much in order to care for all the saints in the groups.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>

Thank You for opening Your Word to us. Even until today the Word is still open. Lord, thank You for Your speaking. Thank You for Your oracle in the recovery. Dear Lord, we are in a position of not knowing how to go on in taking care of the increase, the spreading, of Your recovery. We look unto You, and we trust in You in these days. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL LEADERSHIP<br />
UNDER THE PROPER CONCEPT</h2>
<p>In this message we will have further fellowship concerning the group meetings. The matter of leadership in the groups is very practical. It will be very difficult for us to have the proper practice of the group meetings if we have no leadership at all. However, we do not want to have any organized leadership in the groups. When I went to Taiwan in 1984 I told the saints that we do not like to have any kind of arrangement or official leadership in the church life. For many years before that time we strongly regarded the leadership and uplifted the eldership. It is unavoidable that the elders or some leading ones arrange to sit in the front in the meetings to make it easy for them to take care of the meeting. That is the only reason that they sit in the front. George M&#252;ller, who founded an orphanage in England by faith, was a very godly man. Along with John Nelson Darby, he was one of the top leaders among the Brethren. He was accustomed to sitting at the back of the meetings and did not like to come to the front. However, today we feel that it is more convenient for the leading ones to sit in the front of the meeting. This has been the reason that the elders sit in front. Actually, we should not be legal. The fact that one is an elder does not mean that he has to sit in front. Some of the elders do not need to sit in front. Some, however, sat in back before they were appointed to be elders, but once they became elders they spontaneously came to the front. This indicates that there is a concept within us that makes the leadership something.</p>
<p>In Matthew 20:20-28 and 23:6-12 the Lord charged the disciples not to desire the leadership among them. In 23:8 He told them that they were all brothers. Sometimes when a husband was made an elder, his wife celebrated it. When I spoke on Matthew in 1977, I charged the sisters who were wives of the elders not to consider themselves the &ldquo;first ladies.&rdquo; The Lord charged us to be slaves, not lords (20:25-27; 23:11). A wife of an elder is not a &ldquo;first lady&rdquo; but a wife of a slave. I was forced by the situation among us at that time to speak so strongly in this way, and that speaking cleared up the situation.</p>
<p>The wrong concept of the leadership is abominable in the eyes of the Lord. In the seven and a half years of study that we have had concerning the group meetings, we have taken the basic principle of not arranging or organizing anything. The group meetings must be organic. Likewise, we have taken the principle of having no official leadership. I said repeatedly that in the group meetings everyone is a leader. However, those who initiate and form the groups must provide some practical leadership.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR TRAINING<br />
AND A PROPER ARRANGEMENT</h2>
<p>Many of the brothers have accepted my word warmly, yet no one has done something to have a definite beginning in the practice of the group meetings. Until now I have been like a coach who only gives instructions but does not play on the playing field. I have waited for others to pick up my word and pick up the burden, but I have not seen the results that I expected to see. This has forced me to take the Lord&rsquo;s laboring way and help the churches to begin the group meetings. Without the group meetings there is no way for the spread, the increase, and the multiplication.</p>
<p>The recovery is a family with more than seventy years of background and also with a present situation. Although the number of saints is not large, at present there are approximately thirteen hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery around the globe. Today we are very clear and definitely burdened to have a new beginning in practicing the group meetings to care for these many churches. After the group meetings are formed, we must go out in a simple way to gain people. After we beget the new ones, we need to feed them. Then we need to perfect them. To perfect people is mainly to teach them. For this we have the Life Lessons (see <em>Life Lessons,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry), the Truth Lessons (see <em>Truth Lessons,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry), and many other publications. By using these materials properly we can build up the new ones within one year to do the same things that we do. However, not many of us know how to feed and teach the new ones. Because of this, we cannot see the new ones being perfected.</p>
<p>In order for the brothers and sisters to form the groups, they must be trained. Not everyone is qualified to form a group meeting. Forming the group meetings may be compared to playing the piano. Anyone can press the keys on a piano, but not everyone can play the piano. To play the piano there is the need of training. We have released many points concerning the group meetings, but the saints may still not know how to carry them out. If we practice the group meetings in a natural way, we do not need to train the saints. However, in order to practice the vital groups in the biblical way, we will need many meetings to train the beginners, the co-workers, and those who have volunteered, to form the groups. If we allow the saints to form the groups freely, without any training, the groups that are formed may not be proper. In order to form the groups properly, each group may need to have one or two leaders.</p>
<p>We may say that in principle we do not need man&rsquo;s teaching since we have the Holy Spirit (1 John 2:27). In principle this is true, but in actuality it is not that way. The apostle Paul was filled with the Spirit, and he had much experience of the Spirit. Besides the organic work of the Spirit, however, he also took care of the arrangement in the work. In 1 Timothy he told us how to establish the elders and the deacons (ch. 3). He did not say that as long as the Spirit is in us and we love the Lord and pray much, the Spirit will lead us to know who the elders and the deacons should be. After Paul preached the gospel in several cities, he returned to visit the churches and appointed elders there (Acts 14:21-23). Although Paul practiced this way, he did not write concerning the appointing of elders and deacons in the early days of his ministry. His teaching concerning this matter was given later because by that time he had learned that wherever there was no proper appointment of elders, there would be some confusion or trouble in the church.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s practice and teaching indicates the principle of incarnation: the Spirit works, but He works through man. We must definitely and clearly depend on the Spirit for His organic work, but on the human side, we still need some kind of training and arrangement. To allow the volunteers to go out to get a companion and form group meetings on their own will not work well. An initial training of the saints is very important because out of it the groups will be produced in a proper way.</p>
<p>First, those who volunteer for the vital groups should be formed into groups, and then they should be trained and regulated. This will provide a foundation. Each of these groups may grow and divide into two groups within half a year or at most one year. This is a one hundred percent increase according to the number of groups, although not according to the total number of saints in the church, because not all the members of the church will be in the groups. We expect that one third of the church will be in the group meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>It is best that a group meeting be started with a small number of persons. To start with too many persons makes it difficult to get thoroughly, intimately, and lovingly acquainted. However, with only two to five members it will be difficult to practice the proper function of the group, which needs to visit sinners and gain them for the Lord. It is better to have seven or eight in a group. After a period of time everyone will be acquainted with one another. Before this time we should not go out to work. We should first form ourselves into an acting, working, moving group by getting acquainted, built up, and trained. Then we can begin to function by visiting people for the preaching of the gospel. In this way new ones can be gained gradually, one by one. If the group gains people little by little, it will not be difficult to follow up on and care for the new ones.</p>
<p>In order to carry this out, we need to be diligent. This will involve much work and will require that we all work together. Seven can gain one more and become eight. Then eight can work together to gain another new one. It is easy for eight to care for one new one and thus become nine. Gradually, after working for six months, the group may have fifteen or sixteen. By that time everyone will be acquainted and trained. The group can then divide into two groups. After becoming two groups, everyone will be able to work because they have already become acquainted and have had practice and training. Every group will begin not with new beginners but with trained persons. These will be the foundation for the next generation, and that generation will be ready to go on. We should spend the first five or six months in the groups to get ourselves built up. After this we can double our number in the next half year. This will double the number in the groups. After this number doubles two more times, we will have at least a onefold increase of the whole church. Perhaps our progress will be slower than this, but we anticipate that this way will be successful if everyone will labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTRODUCING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>After forming new groups and going to gain new persons, we need to consider when and how to introduce the new ones to the church meetings. It may be better to wait for a number of weeks before bringing a new one to the church meetings. However, after one is baptized, what will we do with him on the Lord&rsquo;s Day? If we meet with only the new ones, we will neglect the church meeting. If we form groups and take care of the new ones without going to the church meetings, the church will suffer. However, if we do not bring the new ones to the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day but go ourselves, we will neglect the new ones. Hence, this problem is difficult to solve. However, for the Caucasian new ones it may be better to have a separate meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day besides the regular church meeting.</p>
<p>We should not pay much attention to the former way of meeting, but we must still attend the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and the meeting for prayer. Besides these, we still have other week nights and the Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon and evening for the group way of meeting and serving. In this way the practice of the group meetings will not affect the church meetings. We should respect the church meetings, and we should continue to attend them.</p>
<p>After the groups gain a number of new ones, the churches should agree to let the groups meet separately for the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. One or two groups can come together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to have the Lord&rsquo;s table with the new ones. In this way we can bring the new ones into the church life. After half a year these new ones can spontaneously come with us to the church meetings. Then when they come into the church meetings they will not be surprised, because they will have already come into the proper meeting life. In order to have the Lord&rsquo;s table in the group meetings, we need to teach the new ones concerning the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>It may be better not to bring the new ones to the church meeting until we have had the Lord&rsquo;s table with them in the group meetings. At the time a group is ready to divide into two, we may bring the new ones to the church meeting. At that time they will be the same as we are. They may attend both the church meetings and the group meetings, or they may have the capacity to attend only the group meetings. In such cases, we can advise them to sometimes attend the church meetings to get more help. This is the flexible way.</p>
<p>In addition to having the Lord&rsquo;s table in the group meetings with the new ones, we must also teach the new ones concerning other matters, such as how to function and how to prophesy. After they are built up, they can come to the church meetings. Then they will be able to exercise a positive influence in the meetings.</p>
<p>Since we still need to attend the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, it is better to arrange to have the Lord&rsquo;s table with the new ones in the afternoon or the evening on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Furthermore, we may baptize the new ones mainly on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. For this it may be better to meet with the new ones in the church meeting hall, where there is a baptistry. Thus, every hall can be used twice on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, once in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening. To meet and be baptized on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the meeting hall will be more proper in the eyes of many of the new ones. They may be disappointed if the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting is not in a proper place or if it is moved from place to place.</p>
<p>We need to pray and consider all the points of our fellowship in this message. What we are practicing may cause us some complications; it will not be simple, because we will have the church meetings and the group meetings going on at the same time. Eventually, we hope that after a few years the entire church will be practicing the group meetings.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICING THE GROUPS UNDER THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, do teach us how to pray concerning Your move in the matter of grouping. We need Your guidance. We do not want to pray in vain words. We desire to touch Your heart and to touch the crucial items. Lord, do cleanse us again with Your precious blood that we may have a clear conscience with a crystal clear spirit in our fellowship. Give us step by step all the things that we need in order to go on in this matter of the groups. We do need Your leading that we may know what we should do in all the churches in Your recovery concerning this matter. When we come to the practical steps, it seems that we do not know anything. Lord, how should we do this? This morning we are desperate, looking to You for Your clear leading. Lord, defeat the enemy. We hide ourselves in You. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORMING THE GROUPS BY PRAYER AND FELLOWSHIP UNDER THE PROPER LEADERSHIP</h2>
<p>I feel that we should consider taking the way of groups not as something new but merely as an additional part of the work in the recovery. In our speaking concerning the vital groups, we do not need to use terms such as &ldquo;the old way&rdquo; or &ldquo;the new way.&rdquo; Just as a country forms an army, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is forming an army. To form this army, we do not need to stop anything that is presently existing in the church life. We can let everything continue just as it is.</p>
<p>Today to form the vital groups is very practical. We are like a country without an army. Now we feel the need to strengthen our &ldquo;country.&rdquo; To build up our country, we need an army. To form the army, in every church we can gather the volunteers together. Then we need to look into how to form the groups. We also need to consider who the leaders should be. Then we need to get into the practical situation step by step. In forming and practicing the groups, the principles should be the same in every church, but the particular steps do not need to be the same. The church in one locality may take a way that is appropriate to their situation, whereas the church in another locality may take a different way. In principle, however, everything should be initiated by the elders.</p>
<p>At first I held the concept that the saints in the churches should form their own groups, but after considering the matter further I feel that that may not be the proper way. I feel that the leading ones in every church should gather the willing ones and give them a word of explanation to cause them to know what we intend to do and how we are going to do it. Then they should pray and fellowship together for some time concerning the formation of the groups. This should be something besides the normal church activities. This means that we do not do things without prayer. We should pray and fellowship and cause everything to be understood by all the concerned saints. Then we should form the groups with seven or eight members in each group, and we should also select leaders for each group.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Overstressing the Matter of Leadership</h2>
<p>If we stress the matter of leadership too much, we will fall into a snare. We should simply tell the leaders that they should fulfill the responsibility of a leader without assuming the position of a leader. In the world people everywhere like to assume the leadership. However, in the New Testament, although the Lord did appoint the twelve apostles (Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16), eventually, in Matthew 23:8 He said something that seemingly contradicted His appointment: &ldquo;But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; Here the Lord seemed to diminish the apostleship and consider all the apostles merely as brothers. In contrast, at the beginning of nearly all his Epistles, Paul declared that he was an apostle. If one has the capacity, the burden, and the commission from the Lord, there may be the need for him to assume the apostleship. If those who do not have the capacity, the burden, or the commission from the Lord assume the apostleship, the situation will be very disorderly. At Paul&rsquo;s time there was such a disorderly situation. Because of this, in writing his Epistles Paul had to assert his apostleship. The Corinthians questioned Paul&rsquo;s apostleship, and the Judaizers claimed to be apostles in order to annul Paul&rsquo;s apostleship (1 Cor. 9:1-3 and note 3 on verse 1; 2 Cor. 10:12, 18; 11:5, 12-15, 21-23a; 12:11; 13:3, 5-6). Thus, there was a need for Paul to vindicate his apostleship. However, the leaders of the groups do not need to assume the leadership. They simply need to take care of their responsibility and fulfill their duty without having the thought and feeling that they are leaders. To assume the leadership is related to the works of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:6).</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Some Arrangement and Leadership</h2>
<p>Our experiences in the past and our experiments in the recent years have led us to conclude that, although the church life should be organic, by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit, still there is the need for some arrangement. This understanding has been strongly confirmed by the last seven and a half years. During these years I taught that the church life should be organic, without any arrangement under any leadership. However, concerning the practice of the God-ordained way, the coming out has not been as satisfactory as it should be. This may show that there is the need to have the leadership in a proper way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE IN THE GROUPS</h2>
<p>According to what principle should the groups be formed? We should not form the groups merely according to geography or according to the saints&rsquo; age, and we surely should not do it according to preference. The way of choosing according to self-interest always brings in death.</p>
<p>In the beginning we can set up the groups with seven or eight members. Then, within a year each group should double, at which point they should be divided, one group of sixteen becoming two groups of eight.</p>
<p>The most necessary requirement for grouping together is intimacy. After a number of weeks the seven or eight members of a group should become one person in a thorough intimacy. Then, within this inner circle of intimacy the group should practice the fellowship and also the feeding. Gospel preaching is not something to be practiced in the inner circle. The matter of fellowshipping requires a great deal of study and practice because we either do not have fellowship, or we merely come together to gossip. Actually, gossip is not fellowship. It is full of leaven and corruption. We need to avoid any kind of gossip.</p>
<p>We also need to practice intercession, that is, to pray for one another. Intercession depends on and is based on fellowship. Following intercession we need to practice the mutual shepherding and caring for one another. Shepherding is implied in the caring for one another. Then we should practice teaching one another in mutuality. This kind of teaching is very similar to feeding. We should not have just one man teaching; rather, we should practice mutual teaching through mutual inquiry and mutual answering. If we allow only one man to teach, the rest will not be able to practice prophesying. The way of mutual teaching is a foundation of the practice of prophesying. In the group meetings we need to build up all these things.</p>
<p>We will need approximately four months to practice all these things. Then we will practice the last item, the matter of going out to visit people for the gospel. For this we need much practice. We need to study in order to know people&rsquo;s need and to find out to whom we should go. Altogether, we will need approximately five months to form the groups, to be trained, and to practice. I believe that if we will do this, when we go out we will be effective.</p>
<p>If possible we may keep the principle that we will visit people only by recommendation. We need to ask the saints to give us the names of their relatives and acquaintances. Some recommendations can even be made by correspondence. Then we can arrange to call or contact the recommended ones.</p>
<p>Even though gaining Caucasians is somewhat difficult, by all these ways I believe that we can do it. No one can blockade us. According to our present practice, it is possible for those in organized Christianity to blockade us. Actually, they have blockaded us already in Orange County. If we will take the way of groups, I believe that we can jump out of the blockade.</p>
<p>The matter of bringing the new ones into contact with the church should be carried out according to the situation. We may feel that certain new ones are ready to attend a church meeting after only a short time. Some new ones may even ask to come to a meeting. I hope that the church meetings will be greatly improved. I believe that the Lord&rsquo;s present move to form the groups will inspire and uplift the church life.</p>
<p>In the forming of the groups we need to take care of the matter of age. Those who are too old should remain at home to pray for the groups. We may liken the practice of the vital groups to the forming of an army. Not every citizen is suitable to join the army. We need to let the church know that the vital groups are like an army. Those who are burdened are encouraged to participate, but they need to consider whether their joining of the groups will help the groups or not. If not, it is better if they remain home and pray for the groups.</p>
<p>For the first stages of the teaching in the groups, it may be profitable to use the Life Lessons (see <em>Life Lessons,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). The forty-eight Life Lessons will be sufficient for one year. In order to use these lessons properly in the group meetings, we will need much training. We should not let the group meetings go on without any guidelines; there must be some regulation.</p>
<p>The length of the group meetings should be approximately ninety minutes, or at the most two hours. We can divide the meetings into four sections, each section lasting about twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes should be for fellowship, and the succeeding twenty-minute sections should be for interceding, shepherding, and teaching, respectively. The group meetings will not be like the general church meetings; rather, they will be somewhat like an army. We can train all the members of the groups, but we may not be able to train all the members in the church life. Some may not be able to receive the training.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE DILIGENT IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>When Brother Nee wrote the three volumes of <em>The Spiritual Man,</em> he was seriously ill with tuberculosis. He wrote those three volumes in approximately one year, in 1926 and 1927. After he finished, he was exhausted, and he was prepared to die. At least in part his serious illness was due to his labor in writing that book. Then one day Brother Nee was healed by the Lord through a genuine divine healing. According to my knowledge, in his work for the Lord Brother Nee rarely had any peace; on the contrary, he was continually struggling and fighting against all kinds of troubles.</p>
<p>All the serving ones must learn to be diligent, doing everything with diligence but not doing anything in haste. To serve the Lord, we must be like soldiers in the military service. Once a person enters into the military service, he is put under regulations twenty-four hours a day. From the time he rises in the morning to the time he goes to bed in the evening, everything is regulated. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, if we do not exercise and conduct ourselves properly, we will be spoiled. According to our present way of doing things, if the recovery were a commercial business, we would not succeed. In the field of commerce, everything is a battle. However, in the recovery we may not have any sense that we are in a battle. It seems that in everything we take it easy. This is not right. In the spiritual sense, in the Lord&rsquo;s work we should be like those who are competing in business in order to make a profit (Luke 19:13b).</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VITAL GROUPS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46-47; Eph. 4:12; Acts 13:52; 4:31b; John 13:34-35</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your recovery on this earth. Do burden us to pray. Give us the utterance, and save us from ordinary prayers. We desire to pray something living, even to pray Your prayer with Your utterance. Lord, do cleanse us with Your precious blood and anoint us with Your ointment that we may enjoy You. You are the real revival, every day aspiring within us to be revived. Lord, we do beg You to stir up our spirits, and we also want to fan our spirits into flame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ABNORMAL SITUATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>After the time of the apostles the church became abnormal. This is the reason that we must move to form the vital groups. The church today is below the normal level. Brother Nee gave a series of messages which he published in a book entitled <em>The Normal Christian Life.</em> He gave those messages in order to uplift the situation among Christians back to the normal level. If a Christian is uplifted and lives a life at the level portrayed in Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages, he is no longer abnormal but is a normal Christian. We must admit honestly and with repentance that our church&rsquo;s situation is below the normal level. Therefore, we must do something to uplift the level of the church life.</p>
<p>The matter of increase has become a bothersome problem among us. For a long period of time the rate of increase among us has been low, especially among the typical American people. The United States was established mainly by Caucasians from northern Europe. These Caucasians may be considered as the typical Americans. When I first came to America, I had no intention of doing a work among the Chinese people. I had been given a commission from the Lord to bring His recovery to this country, and I made a determination not to do a particular work among the Chinese.</p>
<p>Today, however, the situation in the churches has been damaged. When I began the work in the United States, two-thirds of the saints were Caucasians, and one-third were from other races. That situation was very normal. In 1970 approximately three hundred saints migrated out of Los Angeles to several large cities in the United States. Those migrations were a prevailing success. Before the migrations began, people outside the recovery paid little attention to us. But two years later, in 1972, the number among us began to increase. This caused some outside the recovery to be stirred up.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery began in the United States in 1962 with about twenty-five saints meeting in a home. Eight years later, in 1970, we met with over one thousand saints in the Embassy Hotel in Los Angeles. This was the year that we had the migration. By 1972 our number went up to about twelve hundred, and we realized that we could no longer meet in the Embassy Hotel, because our number was too large. So we prepared ourselves to meet in the Los Angeles Convention Center, which had a meeting capacity of three thousand. The next year, in 1973, we met in the Convention Center, and our number was over three thousand. In those meetings we had several overflow rooms with television monitors. This was an indication of how the Lord&rsquo;s move in His recovery had become prevailing.</p>
<p>At that time the outsiders, stirred up by the devil, began to oppose us. At first, some distributed mimeographed leaflets in order to smear us, damage us, and defame us. Eventually, the opposers published two evil books, <em>The Mindbenders</em> and <em>The God-men</em>. After we moved from Los Angeles to Orange County in 1974, two large Christian organizations in Orange County began to oppose us. Although we responded publicly to the accusations made against us and were successful in getting the two defamatory books removed from the bookstores, our name had already been spoiled. To some extent the opposers succeeded in blockading us. For approximately ten years, from 1976 until 1986, it was difficult for us to gain any Caucasians, especially in Orange County. The rate of increase in other parts of the United States has been better, but in Orange County the rate of increase has been very low. In the past forty months, from April 1989 until today, very few Caucasians have been gained, and a number who were gained have been damaged by the opposers.</p>
<p>This situation has caused me to ask myself, &ldquo;Is there no way?&rdquo; My answer to this question has been, &ldquo;I do not believe that there is no way.&rdquo; There is a way, if there is a will. Where there is a will, there is a way. In October 1984 I purposely went to Taipei to study our situation. As I studied with the other brothers, the Lord showed us the biblical way, the God-ordained way. But not until these recent days did I feel burdened to directly practice this way myself. In these days the Lord has led me to make a strong decision to practice the new way directly.</p>
<p>We need to thank the Lord that He has preserved His recovery and strengthened the churches to go on in spite of the turmoil caused by the opposition. Although the churches are going on well, the condition and morale are still not up to the standard. Therefore, I am not content. We need to step out of the blockade. I do not believe that we have to remain here. On the contrary, I believe that through the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and by His grace and in His power, there is a way for us to leap over the blockade.</p>
<p>Our intention in forming the new groups is to have groups of overcomers. This is the reason that the groups are called the &ldquo;vital groups.&rdquo; We do have some groups already, and we honor them, but there is still the need for some vital groups to fulfill the purpose of the groups and to discharge our burden. The groups that are up to the standard should be up to the normal level revealed in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE&mdash;FOR THE INCREASE, THE PERFECTING, AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The purpose of the vital groups is the increase, perfecting, and building up of the Body of Christ (Acts 2:46-47; Eph. 4:12). The vital groups are to gain the increase, finish the perfecting, and complete the building.</p>
<p>First, we need the increase not only of Caucasians but of all peoples. Acts 2:46-47 says, &ldquo;And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.&rdquo; This is the normal standard of the Christian life. In these verses there are a number of important points. The first point is &ldquo;day by day,&rdquo; the second is &ldquo;continuing steadfastly with one accord,&rdquo; the third is &ldquo;breaking bread from house to house,&rdquo; and the fourth is &ldquo;they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart.&rdquo; The believers in this verse not only enjoyed their food, but they partook of it with exultation. To exult means to praise by giving a ringing shout. The fifth point is that they praised God and had favor with all the people, and the last point is that the Lord added together those who were being saved. The increase comes from this. If we want the increase, we need to have the few things mentioned in these two verses.</p>
<p>In this move of the vital groups, there is no room for anyone to have his own concept or idea. We all need to pray until we drop all our concepts and opinions. In the move of the vital groups, there is no concept or idea; there is only one accord. This accord is not my accord or your accord; it is the Lord&rsquo;s accord. We have only one Lord. Therefore, we should not have different opinions. In the Body there are millions of members but only one Head. There is not only one Head but also one Body. It is impossible for one Body with one Head to have different opinions.</p>
<p>The proper way to be a Christian is not to have opinions and divisions but to continue steadfastly with one accord in meeting in the homes, having the Lord&rsquo;s table, and eating with exultation, with rejoicing and shouting. We all need to be beside ourselves. Brother Nee once said that if a Christian has never been beside himself, he is not qualified to be a Christian. As Christians we must be outside of ourselves, praising God and having favor with all the people. These are the conditions for the proper increase. In such a condition the Lord can add to the church day by day.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:12 speaks of the perfecting of the saints that each one may do the unique work of the ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ. This is the purpose of the vital move to have the groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NATURE&mdash;SPIRITUAL</h2>
<p>The nature of the vital groups is spiritual (Acts 13:52; 4:31b). To be spiritual means to be filled with the Holy Spirit, within and without. We need to practice to be filled every day, every morning, and even every evening. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, fill me with Yourself.&rdquo; Every morning my regular prayer is: &ldquo;Lord, thank You for a good night&rsquo;s rest with good sleep. Thank You for my safety, and thank You for peace. Thank You for Your forgiveness through Your grace and Your cleansing with Your precious blood. Thank You, Lord, that this cleansing brings me into Your presence, and that You are now anointing me with Yourself as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the compound ointment. Lord, fill me now.&rdquo; Such a regular prayer is not vain repetition. I eat three meals every day, and every meal is a regular meal. In the same way, I pray every day that the Lord will fill and saturate me thoroughly. We all, young and old, need to pray in such a way. This will cause us to be active, fresh, and new.</p>
<p>I cannot rest without seeing the saints stirred up by the Spirit and having their spirits fanned into flame. We should all be stirred up by the Lord, and we also need to fan our spirits into flame (2 Tim. 1:6). A proper Christian is one who is filled with the Spirit. We should not be &ldquo;flat tires.&rdquo; We should be those who are filled with the Spirit, within and without, essentially and economically. The Bible tells us that whenever the people of God come together, they should make not merely a joyful voice, but a joyful noise (Psa. 100:1). Whenever they speak, certain saints speak very solemnly. However, if they would speak exultantly, they would be normal. For this we need to be filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Acts 13:52 says that the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. They were filled with the Spirit within. Then, Acts 4:31b indicates that they were also filled with the Spirit without. At that time a number of them prayed together in one accord. Eventually, they were all filled outwardly. They experienced the outpoured Spirit again. In Acts the disciples experienced the outpoured Spirit again and again (2:1-4; 4:31; 9:17; 10:44; 13:9; 19:6).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION&mdash;LOVING ONE ANOTHER<br />
IN ONENESS AND WITH ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>The condition of the vital groups is that of loving one another in oneness and with one accord (John 13:34-35). To love one another may seem very common. However, we must admit that although we do love one another, we may not love one another very much. Because we meet together day after day and year after year, we surely have human affection for one another; but the condition of loving one another in the vital groups should be more than this. We need to love one another, meeting together in a mutual love.</p>
<p>We not only love one another, but we love one another in oneness and with one accord. In John 17 the Lord Jesus said that when His disciples are one in the Triune God, the whole world will believe that He was sent by the Father (vv. 21, 23). This is the way to gain people. Often when we go out to visit people by twos and threes, the people whom we visit may realize that there is no oneness among us. The result is a lack of impact. But if two or three of us go out as one man, the people whom we visit will realize that there is a dynamic power among us. There will be the impact, and they will be convinced.</p>
<p>In John 13:34-35 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo; By our loving one another the whole world will know that we are the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. This is the real impact. Without our speaking anything, people will be convinced because they see us loving one another in oneness and with one accord. On the whole earth, in every society everyone knows that whenever people group together, there is struggling and fighting. Wherever there are groups of people, there will be debates, arguments, and strife. But when people are among us and we are really one, they will wonder what has made us one. The Lord Jesus is the living person who has made us one. Our being one is the strongest testimony that we are the people of Jesus. We are disciples of the One who has made us one.</p>
<p>These are the terms and conditions for us to gain people. Regardless of how much others oppose us, if we are such people, nothing can prevent us from gaining the proper increase.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP<br />
REGARDING THE VITAL GROUPS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for Leadership</h2>
<p>In forming the groups, each group should not have more than seven to eight members. Also, although I do not like the matter of leadership, after many years I have discovered by experience and with the confirmation of the Bible that without leadership no one can be properly grouped together. Leadership is necessary. Because of the need for leadership, the Lord Jesus appointed the twelve apostles (Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16). After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, the twelve apostles remained on this earth. The only way they could remain on this earth to be the Lord&rsquo;s testimony was by being grouped together.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul was a very spiritual person and was organic in all things, yet in his practice he still appointed elders in every city for every church (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). Then in 1 Timothy 3 he taught concerning the raising up of the elders and the deacons. Therefore, according to our learning, there is a need for leaders. We should not have a king, but we do need to have two leaders for each group. Having two leaders will be a help by matching the two together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for a Practical Arrangement</h2>
<p>We also need the proper practical arrangement. In principle on this earth, wherever anything is properly arranged, there will be a proper result. We have the highest truths. If we cannot be successful in our practice, what a shame that would be. Of course, we should pray much. We must depend on God, on the Lord, on the Holy Spirit, and on the divine life, yet we should not forget the New Testament principle of incarnation. The New Testament principle of incarnation is that everything for God&rsquo;s interest should be done by God through man and should be done by man with God. Our grouping ourselves together is to take care of our human responsibility.</p>
<p>We are all for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, we must find a way to meet the Lord&rsquo;s need. If we do not, we will owe the Lord something. Our practicing the vital groups does not mean that we are changing our way. We still trust in the Lord, and we still believe in the Spirit, in the Word, and in the divine life. We trust in these three things to build up the church, but there is the need of the human side.</p>
<p>When God created man, He formed man with a body of clay (Gen. 2:7). That body was an organization, because at that point there was no life in the body. Then God breathed into this body the breath of life, making the body organic. Then man became a living organism. This organism has a physical and visible aspect. Today the church as an entity has the Triune God within as the organic element, and it also has a proper outward arrangement as its physical and visible aspect. Although I taught very much concerning the group meetings, during the past three years I have not seen much result in our practice. After further study I found out that we are short of the physical side, the side of having a proper practical arrangement.</p><h2 class="head2">Principles for Grouping the Saints</h2>
<p>In grouping the saints together, we do not need to legally follow a certain way. We can group the saints together according to the Spirit and according to the situation. In certain instances it may be more convenient to group the saints by geography. However, in some situations that way may not yield the best result. It may be better to group people according to the situation, taking into account factors such as geography, age, status, character, and spiritual condition. In some situations grouping the young ones together with the old ones may not be a help to the young ones, but in other instances grouping the young ones with certain elderly saints will make the young ones more living. It would not be good to group seven people of weak character together, nor would it be good to group too many people of strong character together. In grouping the saints, the elders need to study the situation of all the saints.</p>
<p>In forming the groups, all preferences should be annulled. According to our past experience, some of the saints have a strong preference to be together. However, we need to realize that a particular group may stay together for only six months. After six months the groups should increase to the point that they need to divide into two groups. Thus, we should forget our personal preferences. In some cases if a husband and wife are put in different groups, they will be made alive and they will be more able to help others. We need to put all these matters into our consideration, and we need to learn. In a certain sense, in the church life the husbands and wives are not couples but are individual members of the Body. We need to be coordinated not according to the natural relationship but according to the membership in the Body. At home the husbands and wives are couples, but in the church they are individual members, irrespective of their marital status. In our homes we enjoy our married life, but when we come to the church, we are all members of the Body. In the church we enjoy the church life. This should be the principle. Otherwise, the groups will not be prevailing.</p>
<p>It is better if the Caucasians are grouped with other Caucasians. Those of the other races can also be grouped together according to race and language. In addition, we can have a general English-speaking group, including those from different races who can speak English well. As much as possible it may be better to keep the Caucasians separate and particular to serve the purpose of gaining Caucasians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Relationship of the Vital Groups<br />
with the Present Church Life</h2>
<p>We must be clear that the vital group meetings should not interfere with the present church life. We still respect and honor the present church life. If possible those in the vital groups should attend the church meetings, mainly the Lord&rsquo;s table and the prophesying meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, and the prayer meeting. However, it may not be practical for those in the vital groups to attend the existing group meetings, because they will be meeting at least once a week in the vital groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRAINING FOR THE VITAL GROUPS</h2>
<p>Those who attend the training meetings for the vital groups must be punctual. Furthermore, when they come to the meeting, they must pray audibly. They should not come in to the meeting and sit and be silent. We will have much prayer; this is our real need. Nothing in our Christian life can touch our life, open our eyes, and usher us into the reality of what Christ is more than prayer. We need to pray. Among us we are not short of the Word of God. However, the thing that troubles me continually is our shortage of prayer. In the training meetings every member must function to pray. The third requirement on the trainees is that each one must speak in the training meetings.</p>
<p>After four months of training concerning the group meetings, every group will be ready to act. Every group will be a small army. The first thing we need to do is to go out and gain new ones. Without new ones, we have no one to work on. This time we will not get the new ones in a quick way, and we will not baptize them in a quick way. As I mentioned in a previous message, every Lord&rsquo;s Day the groups may come together to have a separate Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting at a time different from that of the regular church meeting. During those meetings we can baptize the new ones in the church&rsquo;s baptistry. This will make the baptism of the new ones somewhat stately and full of spiritual weight. After the baptism, we can have the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>Our success in having a definite beginning in the practice of the vital groups depends on our faithfulness. We need to be faithful to coordinate with the Lord in order to match the Lord. Then the Lord will have a way. If in all the churches a good number of the saints will be trained to take this way and to move in a trained way, surely we will gain the adequate increase.</p>
<p>Concluding prayer: Lord, thank You that we can match You in Your move. Lord, do grant us the rich blessing, and send the rain that we need. We are going to till the ground and sow the seed. Surely, we need Your rain, the latter rain and the former rain, at the proper time. Amen.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VITAL GROUPS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>Prayer: O Lord, the church needs a revival, and we all need a new start. Even tonight give us a new start with our fellowship. We desire that all the conversations will be altogether new. Deliver us from our habit, and deliver us from our memory of the past. Lord, do cover us with Your prevailing blood against all the fiery darts from the enemy. We want to be free. We want to be new persons. Lord, grant us mercy and grace that we all may be willing to renew our consecration to You. Lord, have such a mercy on us all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROUPING THE SAINTS TOGETHER<br />
IN THE VITAL GROUPS</h2>
<p>In grouping the saints together in the vital groups, many factors need to be considered. One of the most important and difficult factors to consider is the character of the saints. Our character includes our disposition and temperament, among a number of other things. If the forming of the groups is left to the saints by themselves, without any arrangement through the elders, it may be difficult to complete the process. Thus, I believe that it would be better if the elders would meet together to consider the saints and group them together. Depending on the situation, some of the elderly saints, those who would have a difficult time participating in the practical group activities, can be formed into a prayer group. The prayer group is the top group. Nothing is as good as prayer, and nothing is as needed as prayer. The grouping done by the elders should not be a matter of legality. The saints should have the right to ask for some improvement according to their feeling in the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO GAIN THE CAUCASIANS IN AMERICA</h2>
<p>Out of all those who volunteer to participate in the English-speaking groups, the majority should be Caucasians. We are burdened to get the Lord&rsquo;s recovery into the typical Caucasian American society. The Caucasians, mainly the descendants of the immigrants from northern Europe, are the typical Americans. America is built as a democratic country with many peoples. Many of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in America are composed of people from different racial and ethnic origins, all of whom speak English. To reach the typical American community, the Caucasian saints are particularly needed.</p>
<p>When I first came to the United States, I purposely decided that I would not work among the Chinese. I tried my best to work only among the local American people. At that time the immigration quota for the Chinese race was set at one hundred five persons per year. Eventually, the immigration quota was revised, giving the Chinese a quota of twenty thousand a year, ten thousand for Taiwan and ten thousand for mainland China. As a result, tens of thousands of Chinese came to America, a number of them from the churches in Taiwan. Still, I hesitated to take care of the Chinese-speaking work because I realized that if we had more Chinese faces in the meetings, that might disappoint the Caucasian attendants. In 1983 Brother Abraham Chang, realizing the situation, came to me and said that we needed to take care of the Chinese saints because so many had come to America, and many were being lost because of the lack of care. Therefore, from that year I began to take care of the Chinese-speaking saints. However, by doing this we gained on the Chinese side, but we lost on the English side. From that day until today the rate of increase among the Caucasians has been reduced.</p>
<p>At this time we need to concentrate our energy and our manpower to get into the Caucasian community. Therefore, in forming the groups, as much as possible we need to form groups composed of Caucasian saints. It is true that God does not regard persons (Acts 10:34), but the Caucasians regard persons. We are not &ldquo;selling our cargo&rdquo; to God; we are selling our cargo to the Caucasians. They may not buy our cargo. Therefore, we must do something particular to gain the Caucasian people. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s interest, we should not take the easy way.</p>
<p>It is better to form the Caucasian saints into Caucasian English-speaking group meetings. The remainder of the English-speakers can be included in general English-speaking groups. Concerning the older ones, it would be very good if they would intercede for the groups. If they would be faithful, I would propose that all of them pray particularly for the groups for one hour each day. There is a need for this. All the members in the groups need to pray. We need much more prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE VITAL GROUPS IN A NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The number of saints in the churches in the United States is still relatively small, but because the recovery has been in the United States for thirty years, we may consider that the churches in this country are somewhat old. When anything becomes old, it is not so living, active, and keen in its senses. Even those who have been in the church life for only a short time cannot avoid the tendency of oldness from the atmosphere in the churches.</p>
<p>Those who participate in the vital groups should consider themselves something new. All of us need to pray definitely to have a new start from the Lord. Although we had group meetings in the past, I do not consider them as being up to the Lord&rsquo;s standard. What we need is &ldquo;vital&rdquo; groups, groups that are living and energetic. We all must seek to be new. Based on our past experience, we may feel that we know how to attend a group meeting, but actually, we do not know. We know only how to have group meetings in a natural way. For instance, one section of the vital group meetings is fellowship. The word <em>fellowship</em> may be very familiar to us, but many of us do not know how to fellowship. Some do not even know the significance of the term <em>fellowship</em> in the Bible. In our practice of the vital groups, we will practice fellowship according to the biblical way. Our practice will be altogether new.</p>
<p>Even the way we sing hymns needs to be renewed. Our present way of singing hymns is too old. The Bible says that hymns are good not only for singing but also for speaking. In Ephesians 5:19 Paul said that we should speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. There he did not mention singing, but speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S NEED FOR OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>The calling of the overcomers is the last demand that the Lord made in the entire Bible. In the entire Bible the Lord required many things first of mankind, then of His chosen people, and then of the church. However, from these three groups of people the Lord did not get what He required. Then, finally, in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord sounded His call to the overcomers. Today the Lord needs overcomers. In the book of Judges Gideon was raised up to take care of the fighting for God&rsquo;s people. When Gideon sounded the call, thirty-two thousand men responded (6:34-35; 7:3b). Then God told Gideon that this was too many (7:2). Gideon told the fearful ones to return, and twenty-two thousand withdrew, leaving ten thousand (v. 3). Then God said to Gideon that this was still too many (v. 4a). God gave Gideon a way to test the people to determine whom God would choose and whom God would not choose. The way God used was to observe how the men took care of their necessities. Eating, drinking, and clothing are the basic items of our daily necessities. Gideon led the men to the water and allowed them to drink (vv. 5-6). Out of ten thousand, only three hundred drank the water by standing by the river and taking some water in their hands and lapping the water from their hands. These were the ones whom God would use for the army. The rest of the men knelt down on their knees and drank. They took care of their necessity much more than God&rsquo;s need, and God sent them back.</p>
<p>In 1986 I sounded the trumpet, as Gideon did, in the elders&rsquo; training (see <em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 7&mdash;One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). I told the brothers that I had a heavy burden upon me because for more than ten years our rate of increase had remained nearly the same. I was desperate and felt compelled to study the situation. This is a matter of life and death. At that time I was calling the overcomers for the Lord. For six years after that, we made very little progress, so at this present time I am sounding the same trumpet again. To answer the Lord&rsquo;s call today, we all need to be desperate.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:4 Paul said, &ldquo;No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life.&rdquo; The affairs of this life are related to our necessities. We need to sacrifice something for the Lord. If we would do the same thing that we have been doing for the past fifteen years, surely we will not gain the increase. Not many Caucasian doors will be open to us. If this is the case, we will be inferior to two heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. Although these two groups are heretical, they have gained a substantial increase during the past fifty years. They did this by the way of door knocking, yet some among us have reported that although door knocking may work in Taiwan and in America among the Hispanic community, it will not work among the Caucasian community. Door knocking may not work with them, but it may work with others. It all depends on whether we would do it or not, and it also depends on how we do it.</p>
<p>We need to take care of the Lord&rsquo;s demand, the Lord&rsquo;s requirements, much more than our necessities. In 1937 Brother Nee gave an illustration concerning the rapture at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. A sister asked Brother Nee concerning the rapture. That sister had a daughter who was a real treasure to her. Brother Nee told her that when the Lord Jesus comes, if she would ask, &ldquo;Where is my daughter?&rdquo; she would miss the rapture. If we love something and take care of that more than the Lord&rsquo;s interests, when the Lord Jesus comes, we will miss the rapture.</p>
<p>The Lord is very jealous. It seems that He cares only for Himself and not for us. Some preachers tell people that Jesus will bless them in everything. Some encourage people to practice positive thinking. However, if we practice positive thinking, we may still suffer the suffering of Job. Eventually, because of the sufferings that we endure in the Christian life, I was compelled to come to the following conclusion: to be a man, I must be a Christian; to be a Christian, I must be in His church, in His recovery; and to be in His recovery, I must be an overcomer. If we are not overcomers, we will waste our entire life. Compared to the Lord Jesus, everything is refuse. We should not care for anything but Christ; rather, we must count everything loss in order to gain Christ (Phil. 3:7-8). If we mean business with the Lord, we must come up to this standard in being a Christian. This is my spirit and this is my burden. The Lord does need some overcomers.</p>
<p>If we would be overcomers, we must deal with the matter of our character. Character is a leading cause of spiritual death among the Lord&rsquo;s people. Many dear, loving, and faithful saints have been annulled spiritually by their character. They should be very useful for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose, yet many have been annulled not by sin or by lust but by their character. We seek the Lord according to our character. We do things by the Lord and for the Lord, yet we do them according to the taste of our character. Because of this, we have been annulled. The Lord would not care for our taste.</p>
<p>Many people have asked why God mistreated Job. Actually, the Lord did not mistreat Job. However, it may seem that the Lord did mistreat Paul. In 1 Corinthians 15:32 Paul said that he fought with wild beasts (denoting evil persons and matters) at Ephesus. Thus, according to the metaphor used here by Paul, the Lord threw Paul into the amphitheater to the wild beasts. It appears that the Lord was cruel in His treatment of Paul.</p>
<p>After Job suffered for a time, God made him prosperous again, giving him twice as much as he had before (Job 42:10-17). God took away all that Job had. Eventually, He blessed Job twofold. This may lead some to conclude that God is a God of blessing. However, we need to consider Paul&rsquo;s case. It appears that God did not bless Paul at all. If God does not seem to bless us, would we still be Christians? It seems that only a fool would be this kind of Christian. However, through the ages many have been such &ldquo;fools,&rdquo; willing to sacrifice for the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>In a Christian country such as the United States there are too many Christian works. According to recently published statistics, out of two hundred thirty million Americans, one hundred thirty million profess to be Christians. However, I would ask whether the Lord Jesus would be satisfied with today&rsquo;s Christianity. Could today&rsquo;s Christianity build up the bride for Christ&rsquo;s wedding? Nearly all Christians today have been drugged. Many believers today do not have a sober mind with a clear spiritual sight. I do not believe that the bride will include a large number of believers. The bride, who will become Christ&rsquo;s army to defeat Antichrist (Rev. 19:7-9, 14-15, 19-21), will not be composed of millions of believers. How many among the denominations could be counted as part of Christ&rsquo;s bride? We also need to ask how many in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery could be counted? Finally, we need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Could I be counted when He comes?&rdquo; This is a serious matter. Surely, He is coming; the world situation indicates this strongly. Therefore, we all need to be warned.</p>
<p>After being prepared by being trained for several months, we will be the new vital groups. At that time we can be sent out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel. We should not trust in today&rsquo;s Christianity in anything. Although they may preach Jesus Christ and even tell people concerning the true God, many Christians have very little of the reality of God and Christ in their daily living. Furthermore, very few in Christianity know anything concerning matters such as God&rsquo;s eternal economy, the judgment seat of Christ, and the judgment on the harlot, the Roman Catholic Church, by Antichrist with his ten kings (Rev. 17:16). The entire Christianity is drugged, and we too are somewhat drugged by the influence of the surrounding Christianity. We must overcome this situation. The present situation of religion is full of germs and is very contagious. This is why I feel burdened to prepare a group of saints so that they can bring the new ones into the church life and keep them from the pollution and the defilement of religion.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to pray privately, to ask the Lord to show you all the things in the Bible according to His economy. We need to realize that our present situation cannot satisfy the Lord&rsquo;s need. We need a new beginning; then we can go out to gain the new ones, and they will not be defiled by the contagious germs in today&rsquo;s Christianity.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE VITAL GROUPS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 17:19-21; 13:34-35; Acts 2:42-47</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING IN A NEW WAY TO MEET THE NEW NEED</h2>
<p>For the vital groups, the first thing is our prayer. Thus, the first matter in this training will be to train the vital group members concerning how to pray in the new way to meet the new need. First, we should not repeat our old prayers. Our way of prayer has become a form; week after week we pray in a habitual way, repeating the same prayers to the Lord. Such prayers are not genuine prayers. When we pray, we should simply tell the Lord directly what we want: &ldquo;Lord, we want to be revived. We are dead and cold. We want to be burning.&rdquo; To say this much is good enough. In the Bible we cannot find any example of habitually repetitious prayers. In Luke 18:41 the Lord Jesus asked the blind man, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; The blind man answered, &ldquo;Lord, that I may receive my sight!&rdquo; The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Receive your sight,&rdquo; and instantly the man received his sight (vv. 42-43). In the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting we can pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so fair. You are the chief among ten thousand; I love You, Lord.&rdquo; That is good enough. There is no need for us to pray long prayers in which we teach, explain, and expound the Scriptures to the Lord.</p>
<p>We all need to pray. No one should excuse himself by saying that he does not have the burden to pray. How can human beings not have a burden to pray? We all need God. If we need to breathe, we need to pray. We need to pray just as we need to breathe. Nearly everyone eats three meals a day without having any special &ldquo;burden.&rdquo; Thus, we should not take the excuse that we do not have the burden to pray.</p>
<p>We need to learn to pray in a new way and to pray new prayers. We need the Lord to come and stir us up that we may pray in a new, refreshing, and living way. In our prayer there is no need for us to tell the Lord what to do. If we desire to be revived by the Lord, we should simply ask Him to revive us. We may pray, &ldquo;Revive me, Lord. I am pitiful. I need You to revive me.&rdquo; This is good enough. He does not need us to tell Him what to do. Our telling the Lord what to do is not prayer; it is instruction.</p>
<p>Often the prayers in the church prayer meeting are composed of repetitious words, telling the Lord what to do and explaining the situation to Him. In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus did not pray in this way (Matt. 6:7-13; John 17). In Ephesians the apostle Paul prayed two prayers (1:17-23; 3:14-21). In those prayers he did not give any instructions to God. Rather, he prayed, he begged, and he entreated. Let us learn this way.</p>
<p>In praying for the matter of fruit-bearing, some of the saints have prayed, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, You are the vine and we are the branches. You are the fruitful One. We command You to bear fruit in all of us.&rdquo; We do not need to tell the Lord that He is the vine and we are the branches. There is no need for such explanation. We can simply pray, &ldquo;Lord, we are so barren. We hate our barrenness. Deliver us from this sin,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord, forgive me; I do not bear fruit. Lord, have mercy on me. Burden me and even press me to bear fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to relearn how to pray. We have been spoiled by the condition of the church and have picked up many bad habits, yet we think that these are good. However, our habitual way is not good. We have been praying that way for years. What has been the result? In an entire year we might not have borne ten remaining fruit. In his prophecy Haggai, speaking for the Lord, said to God&rsquo;s people, &ldquo;Consider your ways&rdquo; (1:5, 7). We surely need to reconsider our way.</p>
<p>Before we open our mouth to pray, we should consider carefully what we should say. We should not pray anything in the habitual way. When we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I praise You,&rdquo; we must mean that we praise Him. Instead of &ldquo;Lord, I praise You,&rdquo; the Lord may lead you to say, &ldquo;Lord, I just worship You.&rdquo; When you say that you worship the Lord, you should mean it. Often when certain saints begin their prophesying, they say &ldquo;Praise the Lord&rdquo; several times. This is a bad habit. It is meaningless and simply wastes time. I beg you to take my word concerning your prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE DYNAMIC MOTIVATION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S DYNAMIC SALVATION</h2>
<p>Now we are desperate with the Lord to have a new beginning with a new start by first building up the vital groups. We should fully realize that the church as the Body of Christ is definitely a group of the believers of Christ who have been saved by His dynamic salvation. I believe that from the first day, the salvation that I received was dynamic. I was saved dynamically. At that time I gave up the world. I told the Lord that I did not want anything from the world. I just desired to follow Him, to take a Bible and travel through all the villages to preach Him. From that day until today I have never had any change. A dynamic motivation was in me and has been in me all the time. Even today I am here, burdened and laboring for the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>The recovery has been damaged. Thus, we need a real revival. We all need to recover the situation in which we came into the recovery. That is to overcome the leaving of the first love, which is actually the best love. To recover the first love, or the best love, is to give the Lord Jesus the preeminence, the first place, in everything (Col. 1:18). If we give the preeminence to the Lord Jesus in everything, surely we will gain Him. He is the best love; He is the super-excellent love. This is all that we need.</p>
<p>Again I would like to say that the church is a group of people who have been dynamically saved by God. We need to be continually under this kind of dynamic motivation. A proper Christian, an overcomer, is one who is constantly under a dynamic motivation. This we must pray to recover.</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS, LOVING ONE ANOTHER,<br />
AND HAVING THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>In John 17:19-21 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;And for their sake I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word, that they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me.&rdquo; We are all members of the Body of Christ. As such, we must have the real oneness. We are really one. However, although today we are still in the recovery and in the oneness, we need to realize that the oneness among us is not a living oneness. Our oneness is not a working oneness. We all are one, but you are you and I am I. The oneness among us is a dormant oneness, a sleeping oneness. Our oneness should be very active. The genuine oneness will cause us to take action when we hear of a need among the saints in the Body. The real oneness is an active and acting oneness.</p>
<p>We are one, yet we may not know the eight members of our group so well. That is not the living oneness. In John 17 the Lord said that if we have this oneness, the people of the world will know that Christ is the One who was sent by the Father (vv. 21, 23). This indicates that when we go to visit people, they will realize that we are one among ourselves. They will realize that with us there is something heavenly, something divine, that the people of the world could never have. The worldly people cannot be one, yet we are one in a living way, so that our oneness is expressed and is realized by others. When they meet us, people can sense that we have the oneness.</p>
<p>In John 13:34-35 the Lord said, &ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo; If we love one another, we do not need to tell people that we are Christ&rsquo;s disciples. The worldly people will realize this.</p>
<p>The first thing after the training concerning prayer is to train all the saints how to have fellowship. Fellowship is altogether based on oneness and mutual love. We are one, and we love one another. These are two strong signs.</p>
<p>The early followers of Christ, including Peter and John, followed the Lord Jesus full time. They were fishermen, but they left their nets, their boat, their job, and their father to follow the Lord Jesus (Matt. 4:18-22). To the outsiders they were idle, not doing anything but following this One. They did this for three and a half years. Eventually, they saw the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension of the Lord, and that kept them more in oneness. Thus, the beginning of Acts says these dear ones were in one accord (1:14), not merely in oneness. Oneness is not as practical as one accord. They were in one accord with no different opinions, concepts, or insights. They were all one in one accord. They were one hundred twenty disciples, but they were just like one person, and they prayed in one accord. Here is the real prayer. Acts does not tell us what they prayed for or how they prayed, but after ten days of prayer, something happened&mdash;on the day of Pentecost Christ was poured out upon them as the all-inclusive Spirit (2:1-4), and the church was produced. This is what we need. We need to keep the oneness, we need to love one another, and we need to have the one accord.</p>
<p>A group may have only seven or eight members, but these seven or eight must have the one accord. By fellowshipping together in the group meetings, all the members will enter into one accord, and in this one accord they can pray. Then they will really become one. We need to pray in one accord, and one accord comes from oneness and mutual love. When we pray in one accord, we will not repeat the old, habitual prayers. We will be so much in the spirit that there will be no capacity for habitual prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING TO KNOW<br />
ONE ANOTHER THOROUGHLY</h2>
<p>In the training concerning the vital groups, the first item is prayer, and the second is fellowship. We all need to realize that thus far there has been little real fellowship among us. What we have is just a kind of contact. Therefore, in every group meeting the first thing we should practice is to fellowship. In your initial practice of the fellowship you should get acquainted with one another in every detail of your status, your spiritual condition, and your present situation in the Lord. If possible, fellowship concerning everything. When we are fellowshipping in the groups, we need to follow the inner Spirit. Furthermore, our fellowship must be living, organic, and spontaneous. We should know one another very thoroughly, in an up-to-date way.</p>
<p>We might have met in the same locality with certain saints for years without knowing their name or the name of their spouse. This is not real fellowship. We are merely &ldquo;skating on the ice.&rdquo; We never got through the ice to the bottom of the water. This time in the group meetings the fellowship should be first ice-cutting and then ice-removing. Then all of us need to dive into the current to know one another thoroughly. This is the real fellowship. The real love is here. If we do not know one another, we cannot love one another. We cannot love anything that we do not know. But the more we know one another in the proper way, the more we will love one another.</p>
<p>I do expect the number in the groups to double in at most one year. When the number in a group is doubled, that group should divide into two groups. Thus, in the first stage of the group meetings, everything must be worked out as a model. Otherwise, if we all are cold, even if we are able to get someone saved, that one will be the same as we are. If eight cold ones gain another eight cold ones, the coldness will be increased. Therefore, we must cut the ice, remove the ice, and throw the ice away until we get into the water and swim there and get to the bottom in knowing one another. Then, when we gain the new ones, all the new ones will be the same as we are. Otherwise, the church will have no way. We need to know one another; then we can love one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REMEDY FOR OUR PRESENT CONDITION</h2>
<p>The entire church life has been deadened because of our habitual practice. For a long time we have had very little change and very little growth. Our coming to the meetings has been habitual, merely the keeping of a schedule. Among us there is the desperate lack of the exercise of our spirit, the renewing of our mind, and the determination from our will. We all do things in a routine and habitual way. Because of this, we do not know how to fellowship.</p>
<p>The remedy for our condition is to remember that we are a trouble to the church. We all are a trouble. Our prayers may have troubled the saints for years. We should always remember that we are a trouble. Therefore, when we come to the meetings, we must come full of prayer. While we are driving on the way, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, save me from my habit. Lord, tonight I am going to the fellowship meeting; tell me what I should fellowship with my brothers.&rdquo; The Lord is living. He will not say any word to you to tell you what to do, but He will inspire you. When you get into the meeting, He may lead you to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord. I am so happy today, brothers.&rdquo; This is a good beginning to the fellowship. One of the brothers near you may ask, &ldquo;Brother, may I know what you are happy about today?&rdquo; You may reply, &ldquo;I am just happy about the Lord. Today the Lord corrected me. I can tell you only this much. At another time I will tell you more. How about you? Are you happy with the Lord?&rdquo; This is the way to have a living fellowship.</p>
<p>We have the living Lord, we have the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit, and we have a regenerated spirit. We need to do our best to use all these. We should not come to the meeting in a habitual way. When we enter into the meeting place, we should do it purposefully. As you are ascending the stairway you may say, &ldquo;Lord, how good it is to ascend with You.&rdquo; Whether others hear or not does not matter. We need to get out of our habit. This depends on how much we realize concerning ourselves. We need to pray to Him and allow Him to lead us and guide us in every way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRAINED FOR THE GOSPEL VISITATION</h2>
<p>The training concerning the vital groups will have many points. From the matter of fellowship we will go on to the gospel visitation for gospel preaching. This will require much training. In order to preach the gospel, you must know the proper verses concerning God. However, if you visit a person who appears to be very knowledgeable concerning God and very talkative about God, you should not talk with him concerning God. His being talkative about God may indicate that he is a very sinful person. A sinful, wrongdoing person who is somewhat religious is the kind of person who likes to talk about God. If you talk with such a person concerning God, you will fall into a snare. Instead, you should talk to him about the conscience.</p>
<p>We all need to learn by being trained. If we are going to visit people, we must know what kind of people there are in this world and what to speak to each of the different kinds of people. If we would learn all this, surely our visitation will be very effective.</p>
<p>Those in the groups need a time with their group to practice what they have heard: the prayer, the real revival from within, and the fellowship. This will affect their attending of the meetings. May the Lord have mercy on us that we could have a real revival in Him and through His Spirit.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 5:6-7a; Lev. 2:1-13; Matt. 16:24; Phil. 2:2; Eph. 4:3; Acts 1:14; 4:24; Num. 6:1-4; Rev. 2&mdash;3; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 1 Thes. 2:7; Eph. 4:12-13; 1 Cor. 14:1-5, 23-26, 31, 39a</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS AND THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>There are two crucial matters in the New Testament that we all need to pay attention to: the oneness and the one accord. In the New Testament the first time that the oneness among the believers is mentioned is in John 17. In that chapter oneness is covered by the Lord Jesus in His prayer. The Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 followed His discourse in John 14&mdash;16, in which He released the mystery of the Divine Trinity. In the entire Bible there is no higher and deeper revelation of the Divine Trinity than the revelation released by the Lord Jesus in those three chapters. After the Lord completed His work on this earth in contacting His disciples, He was ready to die on the cross. It was at that juncture that He prayed to the Father. The prayer that He prayed was very particular. No mere human being could pray such a prayer. In His prayer to the Father, He used the word <em>We</em> (or <em>Us</em>), referring to Himself and the Father, with the Spirit also implied (vv. 11, 21-22). In verses 20-21 He said, &ldquo;I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word, that they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me.&rdquo; Here the Lord prayed that all His believers would be one &ldquo;in Us,&rdquo; that is, in the Divine Trinity. This is the genuine oneness. The genuine oneness is simply the mingling of the Triune God with His believers. This oneness is also the Body of Christ, for the Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His believers.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:19-20 the Lord said, &ldquo;Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; Here the Lord said that if His disciples pray in one accord, their prayer will surely be heard and answered.</p>
<p>Now we need to ask, what is the one accord? One accord appears to be a less significant matter than oneness. Apparently, oneness is a great thing, whereas one accord is a smaller matter. It is easy to define oneness: oneness is the Triune God mingled with all His believers, and this oneness is just the Body of Christ. However, it is difficult to define one accord.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:19 the Greek word <em>sumphoneo</em> is used for one accord. It means &ldquo;to be in harmony, or accord&rdquo; and refers to the harmonious sound of musical instruments or voices. Eventually, the one accord, or the harmony of inward feeling among the believers, becomes like a melody, like music. Every proper melody is harmonious. When we have the one accord, in the eyes of God we become a melody to Him. We become a poem not merely in writing but in sound, in voice, in melody. Our one accord must be like a harmonious melody. Such a one accord is the nucleus of the oneness. In other words, oneness is like a nut, and the one accord is like the kernel of that nut. In Acts 1:14 another Greek word, <em>homothumadon,</em> is used for one accord. This word is from <em>homo,</em> same, and <em>thumos,</em> mind, will, purpose (soul, heart). The word denotes a harmony of inward feeling in one&rsquo;s entire being.</p>
<p>Today some Christians may claim to have oneness. I have heard some pastors say that since all the denominations have one God, one Savior, Christ, and one Bible, they are one. According to their concept, denominations are not divisions; they are merely means used by Christians to carry out their work. In their view denominations are like the different kinds of bowls and utensils that people use to eat their food. They argue that since different kinds of eating utensils, such as chopsticks and forks and spoons, do not divide people, denominations do not divide Christians. I am afraid that some of the saints in the recovery may not be able to withstand this kind of argument. After listening to such an argument, they may be subdued and agree with the claim that the denominations are not divisive. Those in the denominations may also turn the matter to us and ask, &ldquo;Are you not a division? Before Watchman Nee and Witness Lee were on this earth, there might have been one thousand one hundred divisions, but now you in the local churches have become another division. Now there are one thousand one hundred and one divisions on the earth.&rdquo; It seems difficult to know how to respond to such an argument.</p>
<p>My response to them is this: &ldquo;Yes, you may have the oneness, but do you have the kernel? Do you have the one accord? The families who use forks and chopsticks for eating also use the same utensils to fight with each other. You may have oneness, but where is the one accord?&rdquo; Some among the denominations may turn the question to us: &ldquo;Do you have the one accord among you?&rdquo; If we examine our situation, we will have to admit that even now we are not adequate in the matter of one accord.</p>
<p>If among those in a group there is no one accord, what can the Lord do with them? This is why my burden concerning the vital groups is so heavy. I am very clear that we do not have the full and complete one accord among us. Therefore, in a sense it is hard for the Lord to move freely among us. If we are not in one accord, God has no way to answer our prayer. If God does not have a way to answer our prayer, what can He do with us? Without the one accord, it is difficult to get people saved, converted, and regenerated by the dynamic salvation of God. Thus, our inadequacy in the one accord is a sickness that is more than serious. We have been sick for years, yet we might have been unconscious of our sickness. We may come to the meetings, praise the Lord, and prophesy, but we may do all these things without being conscious of the fact that we do not have the adequate one accord.</p>
<p>Although I have studied the Bible for many years, I did not see until recently that oneness is like the body, and one accord is like the heart within the body. Our sickness is not just like a sickness in the outward, physical body; our sickness is like a sickness in the heart within the body. I am speaking the truth frankly and honestly, according to what the Lord has shown me and according to my pure conscience. We need to know what our sickness is. The sickness among us is that we do not have the one accord adequately. Therefore, we maintain only a oneness with a sick &ldquo;heart.&rdquo; In these past four or five years even this unhealthy oneness has been broken by the dissenting ones. They would not even care for the oneness. We are still here for the oneness, yet within us there is an inadequacy in the one accord. Because of this, it is hard for the Lord to answer our prayer, especially in the matter of fruit-bearing for the increase of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. For this, surely we need to humble ourselves before Him.</p>
<p>The grouping of the saints together in the vital groups is to recover us, and to recover us means to heal us, to cure us. We have become sick; thus, we need the healing. The healing that we need is to be grouped together in the adequate accord. The way to touch the sickness that is among us is to have the vital groups.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING AN INTIMATE AND THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP IN CHRIST AS THE ELEMENT AND SPHERE, BY EXERCISING YOUR SPIRIT WITH MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER, CONCERNING YOUR STATUS, SPIRITUAL CONDITION, AND PRESENT SITUATION IN AND WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>The word <em>fellowship</em> is used in the New Testament first in Acts 2:42: &ldquo;And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; This verse mentions the fellowship of the apostles. Among the apostles there was an intimate fellowship. In the beginning of Acts the apostles were with a group of about one hundred twenty saints (1:15). We may say that that was the apostles&rsquo; group. Among them there was an intimate fellowship. The one hundred twenty stayed together for at least ten days. They ate together, prayed together, and did everything together. Surely they had an intimate fellowship. The day of Pentecost was a day produced by ten days of this kind of fellowship. Among us there is a shortage of such an intimate fellowship.</p>
<p>Our fellowship should be not only intimate but also thorough. We may know one another, but we may not know one another thoroughly. If this is the case, we cannot say that we have thorough fellowship with one another. In the vital groups the members first need to know one another intimately and thoroughly.</p>
<p>Fellowship is the flowing, the current, of the oneness. Ten days before Pentecost, on this earth there was a group of people who were in the fellowship; they were in the current, in the flow, of the oneness. According to Acts 1:14, they were also in one accord.</p>
<p>The intimate and thorough fellowship is in Christ. Christ is the element, and Christ is also the sphere, the limit, of that fellowship. That fellowship actually is Christ Himself, because Christ is the element of the fellowship, and He is the sphere of the fellowship.</p>
<p>The way to have an intimate and thorough fellowship is to exercise our spirit. Whenever we speak something in fellowship, we need to exercise our spirit. According to my observation, a number of saints have the teaching concerning exercising the spirit, but in practice they do not have the reality. For the proper fellowship we need to exercise our spirit with much and thorough prayer. In the vital groups we need to fellowship concerning our status, our spiritual condition, and our present situation in and with the Lord.</p>
<p>We need to build up an intimacy with all the members of our group. To do this, one sister may call another during the day for a few minutes of contact and fellowship. If we love one another, we will always feel that we miss one another. If we would contact one another in this way, we will see the difference. We will be enlivened and stirred up to love the Lord. Our hearts will also be softened toward one another, and we will be able to receive something from one another.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus built up the oneness between Peter, John, James, and all the others who followed Him for three and a half years. They left their families, their nets, their boats, and their jobs just to follow the Lord every day. The outsiders might have thought that to follow Jesus was a waste. In their view, wherever He went, a group of people followed Him doing nothing. It seems that the Lord did nothing, but actually He trained His disciples for three and a half years. Every day when He spoke, He trained them. When He did not speak, He still trained His disciples. His silence was also a kind of training. At the end of the three and a half years, when the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem to die, while they were on the way James and John and all the twelve were quarreling concerning who would sit on the Lord&rsquo;s right hand and on His left hand in His kingdom (Matt. 20:20-24). It seems that they did not gain anything during those three and a half years; but something was built up within them. After witnessing the Lord&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, they became different persons. Among them there was the fellowship, the oneness, and the one accord. At that time they were ready, qualified, prepared, and equipped to receive the outpoured God upon them. The outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4) was the greatest thing that ever took place in the entire universe. Even the creation of the heavens and the earth was not as great. The Triune God poured Himself out upon these people who were in the oneness and in the fellowship and who had the genuine one accord. To build up such a one accord is not an easy thing. My intention is to build up this one accord through the vital groups within the next several months.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BLENDED BY MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER, AS FINE FLOUR OF THE WHEAT, WITH ALL<br />
THE MEMBERS OF YOUR GROUP, WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
AS THE OIL, THROUGH THE DEATH OF CHRIST<br />
AS THE SALT, AND IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST AS THE FRANKINCENSE, INTO A DOUGH FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>In the vital groups we need to be blended by much and thorough prayer, as fine flour of the wheat, with all the members of our group, with the Spirit as the oil, through the death of Christ as the salt, and in the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense, into a dough for the Lord (1 Cor. 5:6-7a; Lev. 2:1-13). To be blended is not merely to be put together as a couple, like a husband and wife. Being &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; is not as advanced as being blended. It is possible for a couple to be married for a number of years and yet never be blended. In human society there are often quarrels between husbands and wives, between brothers and sisters, and between children and parents because they have never been blended with one another.</p>
<p>The New Testament tells us, first, that we are grains of wheat. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus was the unique grain. Through His death and resurrection He released His life into us, making us the many grains. This is very good. However, the New Testament goes on to tell us that as grains, eventually we need to become a lump (1 Cor. 5:6-7a). This means that we need to become dough. The making of dough requires the blending of grains of wheat; but before being blended, the grains need to be ground into fine flour.</p>
<p>The New Testament also tells us that eventually we all become a loaf (1 Cor. 10:17). In a sense, the grains, the fine flour, the lump, and the dough are nothing until they become a loaf. After we become a loaf, we mean something and we are something in the hand of the Lord. The loaf is the group. At the Lord&rsquo;s table, we often praise the Lord for the loaf, the bread, yet in actuality we may not be a loaf. A number of saints among us may never have been ground or broken. Although we are grains, it is possible that we have never been broken and ground into fine flour. On the other hand, we may be broken, yet we may never have been blended together. Thus, we are far from being a loaf. The way to become a loaf is to be blended together in the groups. The loaf is the group.</p>
<p>The way to be blended is by much and thorough prayer, as fine flour of the wheat, with all the members of our group, with the Spirit as the oil, through the death of Christ as the salt, and in the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense. We need to pray over all these points with much and thorough prayer. We need to be blended into a dough for the Lord. Our becoming dough implies our being broken, our being ground, and our being blended. According to the type of the meal offering in Leviticus 2:1-13, to be blended requires the adding of oil so that the flour will not be dry. It is impossible to blend fine flour that is dry; oil is needed to make the flour moist. In the same way, we need the Spirit as the oil to &ldquo;moisten&rdquo; us so that we can be blended together.</p>
<p>To be blended together, we also need the salt, that is, the death of Christ, to kill all the germs within us. We need to realize that we have many germs in our being. All these germs need to be killed by the death of Christ. Then, we also need to be in the resurrection of Christ. In the blending we need to experience the Spirit as the oil, and we also need to pass through the experiences of the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we are able to experience such a blending, we will be absolutely different from what we are today. It is not enough just to put people together and call them a group. That can be done very quickly. The proper grouping with the blending of the members will take time.</p><h2 class="head2">Confessing the Sin of<br />
Individualism and Individuality</h2>
<p>In order to be blended together, we need to confess the sin of individualism and individuality. Our individualism is a kind of principle, a kind of policy, with us. Every one of us has his own policy, his own human logic. Our individualism becomes our logic. The educational system in America educates the young people to be individuals. The logic of being an individual, or the logic of individualism, is a sin in the eyes of God. We need to condemn individualism and individuality. In our church life we may be full of individuality. We may not care for others but may care only for ourselves. Even though we may love others, we may not care for others. In loving others we may still care for ourselves. This is individuality. We need to confess this sin. As long as such germs remain within us, we cannot be one and we cannot be blended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing All Your Defects, Shortcomings,<br />
Wrongdoings, Mistakes, Transgressions,<br />
Trespasses, Outward Sins, and Inward Evils,<br />
and Asking for the Lord&rsquo;s Forgiveness</h2>
<p>To be blended by the Lord, we also need to confess all our defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, mistakes, transgressions, trespasses, outward sins, and inward evils. We need not only to confess these things but also to ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness. The New Testament is full of the promise of the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness (Acts 2:38; 10:43; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 John 1:9). The Lord is willing to forgive and even to forget (Heb. 8:12), but we need to confess. We should make a thorough confession so that we can be forgiven and justified. Then we can be blended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing Your Sinful Nature, Its Defilements,<br />
Its Attachment to the Contamination of the World,<br />
and Its Oldness, and Asking for the Lord&rsquo;s<br />
Cleansing with His Precious Blood</h2>
<p>We also need to confess our sinful nature, its defilements, its attachment to the contamination of the world, and its oldness, and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing with His precious blood. Although we have been regenerated, we still have the old sinful nature with its defilements and its attachment to the contamination of the world. Our inward filthy nature is easily attached to the outward world. The reason that we are so easily attracted to the department stores is that within us something corresponds with the department stores. The department store managers have prepared the merchandise in their stores to correspond with our sinful nature. We all need to experience the death and resurrection of Christ to annul our sinful nature with its defilements and its attachment to the contamination of the world.</p>
<p>We also need to confess the oldness of our sinful nature. As long as we are natural, we are old. We need to confess all this and then ask for the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing with His precious blood. We need the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness, and we also need His cleansing. Forgiveness is to justify us, whereas cleansing is to purify us, to make us clean. Then we can be blended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing Your Dispositional Problems<br />
and Your Peculiarity in Your Character</h2>
<p>We also need to confess our dispositional problems and our peculiarity in our character. We have many problems because of our disposition. All these problems prevent us from being blended together. We also have our peculiarity in our character. In general, a rough person does not have many peculiarities; the more fine a person is, the more peculiarities he has. The peculiar traits in our character also prevent us from being blended with others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Denying Your Self, Your Habit,<br />
and Your Old Way of Doing Things</h2>
<p>We also need to deny our self, our habit, and our old way of doing things (Matt. 16:24). This will afford us the way to be blended together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having No More Confidence in Yourself<br />
and No More Trust in Your Natural Ability</h2>
<p>After so much confessing we will have no more confidence in ourselves and no more trust in our natural ability. All these things need to be dealt with; then we can be blended together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving All the Members of Your Group<br />
with an Equal Love in the Love of God</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we need to love all the members of our group with an equal love. It is common for us to prefer certain saints over others. This shows that we do not love all the saints with an equal love. Philippians 2:2 says that we should have the same love for all the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT,<br />
THE ONENESS OF THE BODY, IN THE ONE ACCORD ACCORDING TO THE LORD&rsquo;S DESIRE<br />
WITH MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>To build up the vital groups, we need to keep the oneness of the Spirit, that is, the oneness of the Body, in the one accord according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire with much and thorough prayer (Eph. 4:3; Acts 1:14; 4:24). Without the one accord we cannot keep the oneness. The one accord is the heart, the kernel, of the oneness.</p><h2 class="head2">Condemning All the Self-exalting Views and Dropping All the Divisive Opinions</h2>
<p>To keep the oneness of the Spirit we need to condemn all the self-exalting views and drop all the divisive opinions. We all have some self-exalting views. Some of the saints may feel confident that they are more knowledgeable and can do things better than the elders of the church. This is self-exaltation. Every member of the church, whether old or young, has some self-exalting views. Whoever has a self-exalting view surely has opinions. No one is without opinion. We need to condemn all the self-exalting views and drop all the divisive opinions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Forsaking All Self-preferences and<br />
Disregarding All Personal Tastes</h2>
<p>To keep the oneness of the Body in the one accord, we need to forsake all self-preferences and disregard all personal tastes. The sisters are often stronger in the matter of personal tastes than the brothers. Our self-preferences and personal tastes are a great hindrance to the keeping of the oneness of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following the Spirit&rsquo;s Direction and<br />
Respecting Your Fellow Members&rsquo; Feeling</h2>
<p>Finally, to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we need to follow the Spirit&rsquo;s direction and respect our fellow members&rsquo; feeling. Regardless of our view or opinion, we should always follow the Spirit. We must turn to the spirit to follow the direction of the Holy Spirit within us, and we must respect and take care of others&rsquo; feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING, WITH MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER,<br />
A CORPORATE NAZARITE&rsquo;S CONSECRATION FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>For the building up of the vital groups, we need to make, with much and thorough prayer, a corporate Nazarite&rsquo;s consecration for the Lord (Num. 6:1-4). We need to do this until we are blended, until we become dough. All the members of a group should come together to consecrate themselves as one entity, as a group of Nazarites, to give the Lord a corporate consecration. We need to let the Lord gain our whole group as one entity for the carrying out of His New Testament economy. Our corporate consecration should not be to fulfill any kind of formal duty, but to serve the Lord according to the organic leading of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BE OVERCOMERS IN THIS AGE<br />
WITH MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>For the building up of the vital groups, we need to be overcomers in this age with much and thorough prayer. According to the New Testament principle, all the believers are and should be overcomers (1 John 2:13, 14; 4:4; 5:4-5), but the majority have become degraded. Thus, in the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord called the overcomers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">According to the Lord&rsquo;s Calling in His<br />
Last Words to the Saints in the Churches</h2>
<p>We need to be overcomers in this age with much and thorough prayer, according to the Lord&rsquo;s calling in His last words to the saints in the churches. The Lord&rsquo;s calling of the overcomers in Revelation 2 and 3 was not only to the church, nor only to the saints, but to the saints in the churches. It is difficult for the entire church to be a corporate overcomer, but individual saints within the churches should be overcomers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Replace the Degraded Church</h2>
<p>We need to be overcomers in this age to replace the degraded church. Because the church has become degraded, it is not what it should be; hence, there is the need of the overcomers to replace the degraded church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING MUCH AND THOROUGHLY FOR<br />
THE FOUR STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>For the building up of the vital groups, we need to pray much and thoroughly for the four steps of the God-ordained way. When we come together in the groups, we need to forget the old way and the old things in our prayer. We need to learn the new way and the new things, which are the four steps of the God-ordained way. The first step of the God-ordained way is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel to seek, visit, and contact sinners for God&rsquo;s salvation to make the sinners organic members of the Body of Christ and offer them to God as the New Testament sacrifice (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). The second step is to nourish and cherish the newborn babes in Christ in home meetings as nursing mothers (1 Thes. 2:7). The third step is to perfect the saints by mutual teaching in group meetings for the work of the ministry to build up the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12-13). Finally, the fourth step of the God-ordained way is the prophesying by all the saints in the church meetings for the direct and organic building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the processed Triune God (1 Cor. 14:1-5, 23-26, 31, 39a).</p>
<p>Day and night we need to pray for these four things. After several months of preparation we will pay our attention to the carrying out of these four things. Before that time we need much prayer. Therefore, day and night, morning and evening, we should not forget these four items. This is the purpose and the goal of our being grouped together. Our being grouped together is to make us a corporate Nazarite and the overcomers to replace the degraded church to carry out these four things.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE FELLOWSHIP<br />
 TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE BLENDING</h2>
<p>If we would practice the blending, we should not forget the matter of fellowship. Fellowship is the basis for blending. Thus, we must practice the fellowship. By so doing we will lay the foundation for the blending. However, instead of practicing the fellowship, we have practiced hypocrisy for years; we have all been hiding ourselves under a mask. Without the foundation of intimate and thorough fellowship, there can be no blending.</p>
<p>We should not be afraid of being known by others. The more we are known in a proper way, the better. This will put down our pride, take away our boasting, annul our superiority complex, and even put aside our inferiority complex. However, most of us are not willing to expose ourselves. Instead, we prefer to cover ourselves by pretending to one another. Because of this, it is difficult for us to have an intimate and thorough fellowship that results in our being blended together.</p>
<p>Without the blending, the Lord has no way to go on with us. Blending is the Body, blending is the oneness, and blending is the one accord&mdash;it is all these things. But we prefer to remain untouched and unknown by others. Because we do not like people to know us, we have become very sensitive, and our being sensitive causes us to be very touchy. Such a condition has forced us to be very cautious in our speaking, for fear of offending one another.</p>
<p>Among us there is a great need for a breakthrough to allow the Lord to carry out the grouping. From the very beginning in the four Gospels, when the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He did not send them one by one; rather, He always sent them two by two, grouping them together. From the time the recovery came to the United States the Lord has not been able to carry out the grouping among us. A number of saints came into the recovery in a very strong way and remained with us, but at a certain point they left. That indicated that they were not willing to be grouped together in the recovery. We who have remained in the recovery all have the problems of our disposition and character that keep us separate from one another. Although by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we are still together, among us there has been very little grouping. Because of this, we do not have the impact. The impact is with the one accord, and the one accord actually is the blending.</p>
<p>If we do not have the one accord, God cannot answer our prayer, because we do not practice the Body. Our not being in one accord means that we do not practice the Body. According to the proper interpretation of the New Testament, the one accord is the one Body. We must practice the principle of the Body; then we will have the one accord. Although we may not fight with one another, we still may not have the one accord. Because we have remained together, we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, but only in a limited way. Therefore, we need to have the one accord to practice the Body.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to open ourselves to one another, but it is even more difficult, after listening to one another&rsquo;s fellowship, to speak something in response in a way that is frank and full of love. After coming together in our groups, we should be free to tell the others concerning our inward situation with the Lord. Likewise, the others should be free to respond. Because we are afraid to expose ourselves and are afraid of offending others, we pretend with one another and are unwilling to let people know our real situation. We need the intimate and thorough fellowship. Of course, we need to be careful concerning what we open to one another in public. In certain cases the public confession of sins has caused serious trouble in the past. I do not mean that we should open ourselves in a careless way. Nevertheless, we need to find a way to be blended. Otherwise, the Lord has no way out of our present situation. We need to be blended until we have an intimate love for the members of our group. If we continue to hide ourselves and keep a distance from one another, when we go out to visit people, we will not have the impact. The people whom we visit will sense that we are not one.</p>
<p>Our situation today is very different from that of Peter, James, and John. When they were together following the Lord as His believers, they were genuine, as seen in the fact that they fought with one another. In Matthew 20, while the Lord Jesus was unveiling His death and resurrection to them (vv. 17-19), it seems that they did not hear what He was speaking. After the Lord Jesus finished His speaking, they had a contention among themselves (vv. 20-24). This indicates that they were very genuine.</p>
<p>If we do not practice the points in this message, there will be no way for us to be grouped. Grouping is an urgent need among us. We are trying to break through in this vital matter. We all need to pray much concerning the building up of the vital groups.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>Our burden is still concerning the grouping. We may have been Christians for many years, yet we must admit that we are too natural. We may think that we are very spiritual, yet we have to realize that we are &ldquo;naturally spiritual.&rdquo; This means that we have not been dealt with by the Lord that much.</p>
<p>A number of you who have prayed a lot in the church meetings should learn to stop yourselves from praying. Your natural prayer has been a very strong frustration to the church life. If you desire to pray, you must learn to pray a real prayer that is not initiated by you. You must learn that in the matter of prayer, you need to be crossed out. Not to pray is a defeat, but to pray by yourself is a mistake.</p>
<p>Some of you pray much in a habitual way in the prayer meetings, but in your prayer it is hard to realize any unveiling or revelation. Our prayer should be full of revelation. The Lord&rsquo;s prayer in Matthew 6 is a simple prayer, but it is full of revelation and without explanation. His prayer in John 17 in also full of revelation. Probably no chapter of the entire Bible bears as much revelation as John 17 does. The apostle Paul&rsquo;s prayers in Ephesians 1 and 3 are full of revelation. This shows us that we have to learn to pray. We have been going on for a long time in a natural way.</p>
<p>Not only in the matter of prayer but also in the matter of the church life, we are too natural. This is why we need to have the grouping, hoping that the Lord would give us a new start. We should not do anything naturally, nor should we be silent. We should tell the Lord that we do not want to be silent or natural. This forces us to learn what it means to exercise our spirit. We have a saying among us that we need to exercise our spirit, but how many of us do it? This saying has become popular among us, but in our meetings it is difficult to see the genuine exercise of the spirit. To exercise our spirit, we need a lot of dealing. We must first deal with our natural way and our natural person, our natural being, which includes our natural prayer and our natural speaking.</p>
<p>The vital groups must be something absolutely new with a new start. A few saints among us can be either silent, not doing or saying anything, or when they do function, they can be very expressive. In their prayer, they cover a lot of things. This is a big shortage; this is also a defect. We should not believe that in one prayer the Lord would burden us with that many aspects and with that many items. When some of us pray or prophesy we cover perhaps as many as twenty small points. In a short prayer of less than one minute, the Lord would not burden us with twenty points. That is our habit. When we open up to pray or to prophesy, we like to cover every direction. After our prayer, we may even forget what we have prayed because we covered too many points.</p>
<p>We should not compose a prayer in which we really have not prayed for anything. Our prayer must not come out of any kind of composition but out of a burden. In this message my burden is much, much heavier than what I can speak. My only burden is for the groups. If I pray, I will pray only for one thing&mdash;the vital groups. The Lord does not need us to train Him, teach Him, or explain to Him in our prayer. He knows everything already.</p>
<p>Some of you, on the other hand, are naturally silent. You do not say anything in the meetings and you do not pray. If all these habitual ways are not broken in us, we cannot be grouped together in a vital way. To be grouped together is to be blended together. According to our experiences, there is no other way to be blended except by thorough and much prayer. We should not talk too much. We should not think that if we talk together, we will be blended. This is wrong. Blending can be accomplished only by praying together. We must be persons of prayer.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was working on this earth in His ministry for three and a half years. In those three and a half years, He worked day and night. Many thousands of people were helped by Him in His ministry, but eventually out of His work only one hundred twenty remained for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s economy. All the rest, including Nicodemus, were not there for the economical filling of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. All of the one hundred twenty were Galileans. Here we can see the principle of grouping. These one hundred twenty were not separate individuals, but they were all grouped together to be one group. On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit came down on one group. The Lord Jesus was the One who grouped them together.</p>
<p>From the first day that the Lord Jesus began to call the disciples, He started the grouping. The Lord was like a big magnet, drawing the disciples to Himself to become a group. In the four Gospels, we can see that the disciples were quarreling and competing with one another. At times they were in rivalry with one another (Matt. 20:20-28; Luke 22:24). The Lord Jesus dealt with each one of them. All those dealings were for one thing&mdash;to group them together. Eventually, those who remained in an absolute way for God&rsquo;s purpose after the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry were the one hundred twenty. The others were not grouped but scattered. The Lord gained only one group, and this group prayed in one accord for ten days (Acts 1:14-15). They stayed together, they lived together, they ate together, and they lodged together for ten days, doing nothing but praying. Then they experienced the outpoured Spirit on the day of Pentecost. On earth at that time, there was only one group whose prayer touched the heart of God and His throne in the heavens.</p>
<p>The church actually was initiated from the first day that the Lord Jesus came out to work at the age of thirty. He gathered Peter, John, Andrew, and James, those Galilean fishermen, along with other disciples. He brought them together and grouped them together. He never let them go. In a sense, they all were &ldquo;jobless&rdquo; for three and a half years. They gave up their jobs to follow the Lord Jesus and be with Him. Wherever the Lord Jesus went, they went. The Lord did not need them mainly to help Him to work, but He wanted them to be dealt with. The Lord did not give them a program or a schedule to follow. He just wanted them to be with Him (cf. Mark 3:14). The Lord Jesus dealt with them day after day. The one hundred twenty were a group of dealt-with people. Before their ten days of prayer, they had been with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years.</p>
<p>They also witnessed the Lord&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension. They saw how the Lord was betrayed, was judged, was brought to Calvary, was put on the cross, and was buried. They saw all of these processes. They saw the empty tomb. Then on the evening of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to them, breathed into them, and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). From that day, the day of resurrection, the one hundred twenty became persons with the Triune God in them. That revolutionized, changed, their entire being.</p>
<p>After His resurrection, the Lord appeared to them over a period of forty days (Acts 1:3). The resurrected Christ dwelt in the disciples because He had breathed Himself as the Spirit into them on the day of His resurrection. His appearing does not mean that He had ever left them; it simply means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and enjoy His invisible presence all the time. Thus, they experienced the Lord&rsquo;s death, the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, and the Lord&rsquo;s training them for forty days. Then the Lord ascended right in front of their eyes on the Mount of Olives (Acts 1:9-12).</p>
<p>After seeing all of these things, could they still be natural? Surely they were no longer natural persons. The Lord ascended, but they still had the Lord within them, and they prayed together for ten days. Do you believe that they prayed naturally? Would they pray a prayer with many items, instructing the Lord and telling the Lord what to do? Surely they did not do this. Would some of them be silent, not uttering a word in prayer to the Lord? Surely they were not like this. Rather, I believe that each one of them prayed for ten days.</p>
<p>Prayer is really powerful, but in order to be powerful, our prayer must be a prayer that touches the throne of God and the heart of God, and it must be a prayer that can move the very God. We have to pray, but we should not pray lightly. We should not pray by composing a prayer.</p>
<p>We do not want to go out to reach others until our grouping is consummated. Otherwise, we may go out, but go out powerlessly as we did in the past. We need to pass through a period of time in which we can be blended with all the members of our group and allow the Lord to gain our group as one entity for the carrying out of His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen that we need to be blended together, we may still not know what to do in order to be blended. Now that we have been charged not to do anything naturally, we may wonder what to do. I hope that from now on in our group meetings we would not pray our old, natural prayers. Then we may say, &ldquo;What shall we do? We do not know what to do!&rdquo; Actually, this is wonderful. The first thing we have to do is to cry to the Lord in this way. We should cry to the Lord, even with tears, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I never imagined that it is so hard to be a Christian. I cannot make it, Lord.&rdquo; This is the best prayer. If we pray this way, even once, our entire person will be changed.</p>
<p>Some of us are very nice persons, but that naturally nice person should be condemned. We are nice yet we are cold like a piece of ice. We cannot be blended with others. Some nice people have set themselves up as a pattern, hoping and expecting that others in the church would be like them. But if everybody in the church were like them, the church would become like a big piece of ice.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BLENDED BY MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>For us to pray merely in our vital group meetings is not adequate. For the blending we need to pray day and night. First, we need to pray by ourselves privately. We can be blended by much and thorough prayer, as fine flour of the wheat, with all the members of our group, with the Spirit as the oil, through the death of Christ as the salt, and in the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense, into a dough for the Lord (1 Cor. 5:6-7a; Lev. 2:1-13). We need to pray, on our knees if possible, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, blend me. Blend me, Lord. Grant me the proper prayer I need. I really don&rsquo;t know what much and thorough prayer is, but grant me this experience to be blended. Lord, blend me as the fine flour of the wheat.&rdquo; We should pray to get through on every point so that we can be blended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing the Sin of<br />
Individualism and Individuality</h2>
<p>We need to confess the sin of individualism and individuality. Individualism is a kind of logic, and individuality is a kind of living. We do have a kind of logic by which we live, and that logic is individualism. This &ldquo;ism&rdquo; has become a kind of living, and that living is individuality. We have to pray, maybe for more than ten days, to get through on this point.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing All Our Defects, Shortcomings, Wrongdoings, Mistakes, Transgressions, Trespasses, Outward Sins, and Inward Evils,<br />
and Asking for the Lord&rsquo;s Forgiveness</h2>
<p>We need to confess all our defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, mistakes, transgressions, trespasses, outward sins, and inward evils and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness. We have to get through all of these points by prayer. I have been doing this for years. What I am sharing here is altogether from my experience. We may confess that we are wrong in a certain matter, but the Lord would not let us go. He wants us to make a detailed confession of our transgressions and trespasses. In the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we should itemize the things in which we have transgressed and trespassed. We have to get through with the Lord. We are so natural and rough. We have never been washed by the Lord finely. We need a fine washing. We need to get through all these items by prayer. If we pray in this way, even once, we will sense that we are different.</p>
<p>We need to confess our outward sins and inward evils to the Lord, asking for His forgiveness. We may be able to count our outward sins, but it is hard for us to enumerate our inward evils. Our inward evils are countless. We are the totality of evil. If we are under the Lord&rsquo;s enlightening, we will realize that our thinking, our intention, and our desire are all evil. Our good intentions are not pure. Our motive is not pure. Even our laughing is not pure, but with a hidden motive. We have to be enlightened and dealt with by the Lord to such an extent.</p>
<p>Eventually, we would realize and tell the Lord that we cannot enumerate all our inward evils. Under His light we would realize that we are just evil. When we look at people, we look at them with an evil purpose. When we go to see people, to visit people, our visit is not that pure but is a mixed thing. If we have not been dealt with to such an extent in our contact with the Lord, we can never be blended with others. We need to be dealt with to such an extent that we lose our confidence in ourselves. We will then realize that in ourselves we cannot be pure. When we pray, we pray with an impure intention. When we speak for the Lord in the church meetings, we have a desire to get more &ldquo;Amens.&rdquo; That intention is impure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing Our Sinful Nature, Its Defilements,<br />
Its Attachment to the Contamination of the World, and Its Oldness, and Asking for the Lord&rsquo;s Cleansing with His Precious Blood</h2>
<p>We also need to confess our sinful nature. Our nature is our very being, and this being is altogether dirty and rotten. It has been corrupted. This nature has its defilements and its attachment to the contamination of the world. The entire world is a contagious ball. If we become attached to it, we are immediately contaminated. We must be dealt with by the Lord to such an extent that we dare not touch anything worldly. To our feeling, to our consideration, the entire world is a big contagious ball.</p>
<p>We also have to deal with the oldness of our sinful nature. Our nature was inherited from Adam, so it is almost six thousand years old. A young person may think that he is only twenty-four years old, but actually he is almost six thousand years old according to his Adamic nature. This is why the Bible says that we need to be renewed (2 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 12:2). We need to be renewed because we are old.</p><h2 class="head2">Confessing Our Dispositional Problems<br />
and Our Peculiarity in Our Character</h2>
<p>Then we need to confess our dispositional problems. We have many problems with our disposition. Quite often we take an excuse by saying, &ldquo;I was born that way.&rdquo; This is the excuse of our dispositional problem. We need to condemn our natural disposition, not excuse it. Many of us pray according to our disposition. For certain brothers and sisters to pray short prayers is very difficult. If some of the saints prayed short prayers of two sentences in the prayer meeting, that would be a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; because this is not according to their disposition. We do not realize how bad we are naturally and dispositionally. We also have the peculiarity in our character. We have to deal with this by thorough and much prayer. We cannot have such a thorough dealing within a short time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Denying Our Self, Our Habit,<br />
and Our Old Way of Doing Things</h2>
<p>We also need to deny our self, our habit, and our old way of doing things (Matt. 16:24). There are so many troubles related to us which need to be dealt with. As fallen beings, we are a composition of troubles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having No More Confidence in Ourselves<br />
and No More Trust in Our Natural Ability</h2>
<p>Do we believe that today we have no more confidence in ourselves and no more trust in our natural ability? If this trust were taken away from us, we could not live. We live because we have confidence in ourselves and trust in our ability. But if we trust in our ability, we cannot be blended with others. If we have even a little bit of self-confidence, self-trust, we cannot be blended with others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving All the Members of Our Group<br />
with an Equal Love in the Love of God</h2>
<p>We need to love all the members of our group with an equal love in the love of God (Phil. 2:2). It is difficult to find anyone who loves others with an equal love. We always love according to our preference and our taste.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER<br />
FOR OUR BLENDING AND FOR OUR DYNAMIC ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord, we have learned not to criticize or condemn others. On the other hand, to build up a church, the most needed thing for the leading ones is to know the saints. If we do not know the saints, how can we build them up? Some of us came together to study every saint in our arranging of the vital groups. Because of the peculiarities of the saints, this was a difficult task. One saint is too strong, while another is too soft. One saint has a habit of praying too much to kill the meeting, but another never prays. All of us have our dispositional problems and the peculiarity in our character. All of us are descendants of Adam. Then what shall we do? We must go to the Lord and pray.</p>
<p>In these coming weeks, we have to go to the Lord in prayer every day to deal with all the above items. We need to pray thoroughly. The more we pray, the more we will be dealt with in these items and the more we will be blended. Then no one will be able to offend us. Today we are very sensitive because we have not allowed the Lord to deal with us.</p>
<p>When we come together in these days, we need to pray mainly for the blending. The blending implies all these dealings. If the fine flour is to be blended into dough, we cannot have any hard pieces remaining in the flour. There are many &ldquo;hard pieces&rdquo; still remaining in our being. Since this is the case, how can we be blended with others? There is no other way for us to be blended except by prayer. If we are dealt with to the extent which we have talked about, we will not be able to be offended. Someone may tell us that we are not so nice. We may respond, &ldquo;You are right. I am even worse than what you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we come together, we should pray for our being blended together. The second thing we have to pray for is our dynamic activities. We need to pray for our function, for our activities. Eventually, we need to go out to bring people to Christ and to keep people in Christ and in the church. We need something dynamic, and this needs our prayer. Before the day of Pentecost, the one hundred twenty prayed together for ten days. We cannot do anything without prayer. We need to be blended together by thorough and much prayer so that we can go out dynamically. We have to pray for our blending and for our dynamic activities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>QUESTION: I realize that we need much and thorough prayer, but when I start to pray, it seems that I do not have that much to say. How do we pray thoroughly?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Our concept is that thorough prayer is to explain. Paul, however, said that we do not know what to pray but the Spirit helps us in our weakness, interceding for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (Rom. 8:26). We do not know how we should pray; hence, we groan (v. 23). In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us. In our dealing with the Lord, we may groan, &ldquo;O Lord, my character. My character, Lord! What shall I do, Lord?&rdquo; This is thorough prayer.</p>
<p>We need to cry out to the Lord. Many of us are too nice. When the Spirit is on us, however, we will forget about being nice. The less words we speak the better. But the more we groan and cry out to the Lord, the better. If we could kneel for thirty minutes, groaning and crying out to the Lord, this is the best prayer.</p>
<p>We need the Lord&rsquo;s breaking through His cross. Otherwise, it will be hard for us to exercise the spirit because we are too much in the mind. The many items we have in our prayer are evidence that we are in our mind. Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 8 concerning coming to the Lord to groan is very meaningful. We might pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I don&rsquo;t know what to pray, but I know my natural man is condemned and my character has a lot of problems. Have mercy upon me.&rdquo; If we try to explain things in our prayer, we may be able to do this for only ten minutes. Then our speaking will be exhausted. But we can never graduate from groaning. We have to learn to shout, to cry out, and to groan.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Is it wrong not to be able to pray in a group if you feel like someone has done something against you?</p>
<p>ANSWER: As long as we can be offended, we are a failure. We have to pray, &ldquo;Lord, save me from the feeling that I have been wronged. Lord, I am still so natural. I am still so much in myself.&rdquo; This is a good prayer, a genuine prayer. Such prayer always conveys a certain amount of enlightenment and revelation. When we pray in our natural way, our prayer is darkening; it does not enlighten.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What should we pray for when we come together in our vital groups?</p>
<p>ANSWER: In this period of time, we should pray only for our blending and for the activities of the vital groups. We should pray for these two things privately and when we come together. We cannot pray too much for them. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, blend us. Blend me with the others in my group so that we can have the impact in our activities.&rdquo; We should forget about all other things and focus on this.</p>
<p>Confessing is a very crucial part of the blending. Without confessing, we cannot be blended with others. A prayer life is a life that revolts and rebels against our natural being. If we are naturally nice, this may prevent us from crying out by the inspiration of the Spirit. According to our natural being, we may pray too much and too long, not caring for others but only for our own feeling. Others are naturally silent. We have to rebel against our natural being. A prayer life is a rebellion. Some who were born so bold have to rebel against themselves to be silent for a period of time. The real prayer life stops our natural being.</p>
<p>Prayer is the release of the spirit. If you do not release your spirit, you can never receive the Spirit. This may be likened to a water hose. When water is coming out of the hose, this means that water is coming into it. Thus, to release our spirit is to receive the Spirit. But a number of us would not care for the release of the spirit but only for our habitual prayer. Some bold and talkative ones should not pray in the prayer meetings for a period of time. This is what it means to rebel against our natural life.</p>
<p>Sometimes we pray so fast that no one can follow us. Paul indicated that we need to pray in a way that others can say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to our prayer (1 Cor. 14:16). Based upon this principle, we have to pray audibly so that others can hear our prayer. We have to pray by crying, by shouting, or in a proper, audible way. Some of us need to slow down our speaking so that others can hear us and say, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this fellowship we all can realize that our habitual way is the killing way. We have killed the church life without any awareness. The Christian life is a life of the Spirit. To pray is to exercise our spirit, to release our spirit, that we may receive more of the Spirit. When more water goes out through the hose, more water comes in. If we stop the &ldquo;going out,&rdquo; the &ldquo;coming in&rdquo; is also stopped. The release of our spirit is the receiving of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have been building up ourselves for too long, so it is really hard for the Spirit to do anything through us. Also, it is hard for us to exercise our spirit because we are so natural. We do not have the habit of using our spirit. We are habitual in using all the other parts of our being, but not our spirit.</p>
<p>QUESTION: When we pray corporately, does it matter if we say &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; in our prayer?</p>
<p>ANSWER: This question indicates that you are in your mind. When you are releasing the spirit, the Spirit leads you. If He leads you to say &ldquo;I,&rdquo; you say &ldquo;I.&rdquo; If the Spirit leads you to say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; you say &ldquo;we.&rdquo; There is no legality.</p>
<p>When you try to pray in the meeting, you must get yourself prepared. You are not going to speak something common. You are going to say something particular. This is a petition expressed to the throne in the heavens. It is a great matter. Do not pray in a light way. It is the same thing in speaking for the Lord. We must get ourselves prepared to speak for the Lord. This is to rebel against our self. If we are willing to be corrected and rescued from our habitual ways, this will be a big blessing to the church meetings.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE ACCORD, PRAYER, AND<br />
THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT FOR BLENDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:42; 6:4; Eph. 6:18</h1>
<h1 class="scripture"><em>Hymns,</em> #846</h1>
<p>I would recommend that we pray-read all of the verses cited above in the Scripture reading so that we can enter into the burden of this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>In these days we are burdened for the blending of the saints in the vital groups. We may pray for this blending and talk about it, but how can we be blended to have the real one accord? The Greek word for one accord is <em>homothumadon,</em> from <em>homo,</em> meaning same, and <em>thumos,</em> meaning mind, will, purpose (soul, heart). The one accord refers to the harmony in our inner being, in our mind and will. In Matthew 18:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; <em>In harmony</em> here is as musical sounds are in harmony. We need this harmony as our one accord. How can we have this?</p>
<p>We have to realize that according to God&rsquo;s ordination our soul should not direct our entire being. Of course, all fallen men are either directed by the flesh to live a fleshly, sinful life or directed by the soul to live a kind of philosophical life, logical life, or ethical life. A fleshy and fleshly man is a person who lives in the flesh under the influence and nature of the flesh (1 Cor. 3:1, 3a). A person whose soul dominates his entire being is what the Bible calls a soulish man (1 Cor. 2:14). Such a person attempts to control the lusts of his flesh by his logic of ethics. That kind of control is directed by the soul. But according to the God-ordained way, it should be our spirit that is strong to direct our soul, even to control our entire being. A person who is dominated, governed, directed, moved, and led by his mingled spirit is a spiritual man (1 Cor. 2:15). Today we desire to be blended, and our being blended will surely produce a one accord in our spirit under the direction of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in harmony. In the book of Acts, we can see that the one hundred twenty practiced the Lord&rsquo;s command to pray in harmony, to pray in one accord (1:14). Their one accord was produced by their being in the spirit. In the four Gospels, none of the disciples understood anything about being in the spirit. The Lord called James and John &ldquo;Sons of Thunder&rdquo; because of their impetuosity (Mark 3:17). When the Lord and His disciples were not received by the Samaritans, James and John said, &ldquo;Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&rdquo; The Lord rebuked them and said, &ldquo;You do not know of what kind of spirit you are&rdquo; (Luke 9:54-55). They did not care for the Spirit because their spirit had not yet been regenerated. But in the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them (John 20:22). The Lord became a life-giving Spirit on the day of resurrection and was breathed into His disciples.</p>
<p>With the spiritual things in the Bible, there is first the position and then the reality. The birthright is first a positional matter and then the reality follows. First Peter 1:3 says that we all were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. When Christ was resurrected, we were also resurrected (Eph. 2:6) and regenerated. The position of our regeneration was fully gained by Christ on the day of His resurrection. Thus, we were positioned into the resurrection almost two thousand years ago. But we did not receive this reality until the day that we confessed our sins and believed in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Only the Lord Himself knew about the position of our regeneration. We did not realize anything about this until the day we received the Lord in time as the reality of regeneration. This may be compared to a small child having the position to receive his birthright. He does not know anything about his birthright until he becomes twenty-one years old. Then he receives the reality of his birthright. In the morning of the day of His resurrection, the Lord gained the position of regeneration for His disciples. But that evening the Lord breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples. That was when they received the Lord as the life-giving Spirit for the reality of their regeneration.</p>
<p>By reading the New Testament we can see the difference between what the disciples were in the Gospels and what they were in Acts. Even though the disciples followed the Lord quite faithfully in His earthly ministry, they were either in the mind or in the flesh. Peter even acted in a way that caused the Lord Jesus to call him &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; (Matt. 16:23). But in Acts their situation was entirely different. In Acts they were spiritual persons. How could the one hundred twenty pray together for ten days in one accord? Only people who are in the spirit could do this. They were people in the spirit because the Spirit had been breathed into them. A number of times in the Gospels, Peter spoke in a nonsensical way and was rebuked or corrected by the Lord. But in Acts 1 he could expound and interpret the Bible (vv. 15-22). This proves that the disciples were in the spirit in Acts 1. This is why they were able to pray together in one accord for ten days. They prayed in one accord, and they prayed to build up the one accord. There was a very strong one accord among them.</p>
<p>We cannot say that there is no one accord among us today. To say this is not fair. We do have the one accord, but everything has its degree. There may be many graduates in a school, but their graduation is in different degrees. Some graduate as &ldquo;straight A&rdquo; students. Others graduate as &ldquo;C&rdquo; or even &ldquo;C&#150;&rdquo; students. All of these students graduate but they graduate in different degrees. We have the one accord today, but how high and how deep is our one accord? This is a problem. The one hundred twenty prayed in one accord for ten days. Probably on the tenth day, their one accord went to the heavens. It became the strongest and the highest one accord. At that time the heaven opened and the Spirit was poured out.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING SHORT PRAYERS</h2>
<p>Today we need to be blended together by much and thorough prayer. In our prayer we should not merely exercise our spirit but also release our spirit. Praying is the unique way for us to exercise our spirit and even the more to release our spirit. When our spirit is released, we can be blended together in this released spirit. Actually, when our spirit is released, there is no need to talk about blending. The released spirits are a kind of blending.</p>
<p>When we come together to pray, we need to release our spirit by praying short prayers. Our prayers are too long. The long prayer is a prayer of composition. It is not prayer out of a burden. The real burdened prayer would not be a long composed prayer. At one time in the 1960s when we were in Los Angeles in Elden Hall, our prayers were very short. Sometimes we had over two hundred in our prayer meeting. Each saint would pray one sentence, and we were like one person praying together. We coordinated together in our prayer, and there were no long prayers. In one recent meeting, I pointed out to some of the co-workers that their prayers were too long.</p>
<p>Soon after I was saved, I met with the Brethren. We always had a long prayer meeting with long prayers. In that long meeting, there were only four or five who prayed. Four or five occupied the entire time, and the composition of their prayers was mostly the same. Furthermore, among these four or five who prayed, we usually knew in what order they would pray. When the prayer came to the last one, everyone knew that after his prayer, we would soon be dismissed. Our church prayer meeting has reached this kind of situation with long prayers. Long prayers kill, but short prayers stir us up. Short prayers fan our spirit into flame.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for the brothers and sisters who are used to praying long prayers to have a change to pray in a short way. Those who pray long prayers always lay a foundation of much explanation in their prayer. They explain to the Lord why they need to pray, or they give the Lord directions about how to answer their prayer. They may say, &ldquo;Lord, You are so good. We are not praying for ourselves. We are not on this earth. Lord, we are today in the heavens. Even we are at Your throne....&rdquo; We need to drop this way of explaining in our prayer to the Lord. In order to blend ourselves together in the vital groups, we must drop the old way of praying long prayers. We should pray short prayers, simply telling the Lord what we want Him to do for us (cf. Mark 10:51).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTINUING STEADFASTLY IN PRAYER</h2>
<p>Acts 2:42 shows us the importance of such prayer. The three thousand who entered into the church life all continued in four things: the teaching of the apostles, the fellowship of the apostles, the breaking of bread, and the prayers. Prayer was one of the four critical items in which they continued. Today I would say that we have the first three items. We remain in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, and we have the breaking of bread, the remembrance of the Lord at His table, every Lord&rsquo;s Day. Today our best meeting is the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, but our prayer is inferior. Even our attendance in the prayer meeting was very low at one time, and the persons who prayed mostly were dead and dying. They prayed in a dead and dying way. Thus, many of the saints lost the appetite to come to the prayer meeting.</p>
<p>The prayers in the prayer meeting have been long prayers, full of explaining to the Lord and of giving the Lord descriptions and instructions. Very few would ask the Lord directly what they wanted Him to do. There was also very little commanding in our prayers. It was rare to hear anyone pray, &ldquo;Lord, we give You the word. We give You the command. You have to come in to do it.&rdquo; This kind of commanding prayer is needed (Isa. 45:11). We need to learn to pray in a proper way in the prayer meetings. We should pray slowly, pray emphatically, and pray spiritually. We should practice this kind of prayer in all of the vital groups.</p>
<p>The three thousand who were gained on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the prayers of the Spirit with a real burden. First, the one hundred twenty continued steadfastly in prayer for ten days. Then the three thousand continued steadfastly in prayer. Acts 6:4 also tells us that the apostles made the decision to continue steadfastly in prayer and the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WATCHING UNTO PRAYER</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:18 Paul said that we need to pray at every time in spirit and watch unto this in all perseverance. We need to be watchful, on the alert, for the maintaining of our prayer life. Praying must be followed by watching. We have to add watching to our praying. After we make the decision to pray, many things will rise up to keep us away from praying. This is why we have to watch unto our prayer in all perseverance. To watch means that we are on the battlefield. The battle is raging, and there are enemies around us.</p>
<p>If we want to continue steadfastly in prayer, we need to schedule and even to budget our time in the way that we would budget our money. If we do not budget our money, we will spend it without any control. Since we budget our money, we should also budget our time. In the budget of our time, we should set up at least two or three times for prayer. In the morning, we could pray for at least fifteen minutes. Then according to our schedule, we could budget another time for prayer in the mid-morning, noon, or afternoon. Then we can budget another time in the evening before going to bed. We should budget these three times for prayer.</p>
<p>If you make a decision beginning from tomorrow to pray at certain times, be prepared for things in the environment rising up to frustrate you. As you begin to pray, someone may knock on the door. Throughout the days of the year, no one knocked on your door at this time except after you made the decision to use this time to pray. When you go to the door to see who it is, you may find out that the person knocked on the wrong door. That may cause you to be angry and lose your heart to pray. Thus, the fifteen minutes which you set aside for prayer will be annulled. If you decide to pray at 10 A.M., three friends may come to visit you at that time to spend an hour with you. We have to realize that such things are the attack of the enemy against our prayer.</p>
<p>It is best not to answer the door or the telephone during our prayer time. Actually, we are too busy to go to the door or answer the phone during our time of prayer. We are busy in contacting our Lord, our King. Since we are with our King, how can we go away from Him to attend to other things? We should not allow anything to interrupt our prayer time, our time with our King. In one sense, we should consider that we are away from home during our prayer time. We are away from home taking care of our King. The Lord could say to us, &ldquo;You are here occupied by Me. How could you leave Me here, go to answer the door, and be occupied by your friends for one hour?&rdquo; Surely this is not right. We need to pray at every time in spirit and watch unto this prayer in all perseverance. <em>Perseverance</em> means to be very strong in our insistence. Our attitude in our prayer should be that we are now with our King and that we would not be interrupted from having this time with Him.</p>
<p>We have to watch. The enemy will always do things to annul our prayer time. If this were not the case, the apostle would not have charged us to watch unto prayer in all perseverance. We should not allow our prayer to be spoiled, captured, or annulled. We need to watch and be on the alert to maintain our prayer time. We should always keep our prayer time. During this time we should consider that we are away from home because we are busy with our King, with our Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">RELEASING OUR SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>The proper prayer always releases us. If we pray and our spirit is not exercised and released, our prayer is wrong. Prayer must exercise our spirit and release our spirit. When our spirit is released by our prayer, we are released persons. When we are no longer bound but released, we are always happy. This is why Paul said, &ldquo;Always rejoice, unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:16-17). To rejoice all the time is related to praying unceasingly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we are not released, we cannot be blended with others. If we come to the meeting with a quiet spirit, we are bound. If we attend the vital group meetings in this way, there is no possibility of our being blended. When you are released, when I am released, and when everyone is released, that is the real blending. The way for us to become blended is through prayer that releases our spirit.</p>
<p>Acts 1:14 says that the one hundred twenty continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, &ldquo;together with the women....&rdquo; We need to consider why the Bible says &ldquo;with the women&rdquo; in this verse. Every word in the Bible is written with a purpose. I hope the sisters would give me the permission to speak a frank word. The one accord is always troubled by the women. When the sisters have no problem in the church, the church will most likely have no problem. In the church life there are generally more sisters than brothers. In the home in Bethany spoken of in John 12, there were two sisters and one brother (vv. 2-3). We can see from this that the church life greatly depends upon the sisters. When the sisters are okay, the church life will most likely be okay. The vital future of the vital groups greatly depends upon the sisters. If the sisters are blended, the blending of the groups will be successful.</p>
<p>In order to be blended, all of us need to release our spirit in our prayer. We may pray together without being released in our prayer. Instead, all of us may be bound. Most of the good composers of long prayers are sisters. Few among the brothers would pray long prayers full of explanations and descriptions. I would advise some of the sisters not to pray that many times. Also, we should not pray too fast because the saints will not be able to follow our prayer. Paul indicated that we need to pray in a way that the saints will be able to say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to our prayer (1 Cor. 14:16). We should pray so that others can hear our prayer, understand our prayer, realize our prayer, agree with our prayer, and thus say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to our prayer.</p>
<p>I realize that all of us in this training love the Lord. To find a group of people loving the Lord and loving the recovery so much is a treasure. But we have all been annulled by our shortcomings. We all have our particular shortcomings which annul us and forfeit our proper function. We all have defects which prevent us from being fully profitable to the church. But in spite of all our disadvantages, the Lord is still with His recovery.</p>
<p>Our cooperating with the Lord to move to Russia has been a great encouragement to me. Within less than one year we raised up churches in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Lord has blessed us with the laborers, with the material supply, and with the fruitful result in His move in Russia. This shows that in spite of all of our shortcomings and defects, the Lord has still blessed His recovery.</p>
<p>I appreciate that all of us love the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we did not love the recovery, we would not be here. But we need to see that in the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the first dealing of the Lord is concerning the recovery of the first love (2:4). Do we love Him? Surely we do. But do we give Him the preeminence, the first place, in all things? To give the Lord the first place in all things is to love Him with the first love, the best love. In order to give Him the preeminence, we must be willing to be adjusted, to be broken, to be made nothing, so that the Lord can have a way in us, through us, and among us for the building up of His organic Body.</p>
<p>In this message I would also like to recommend <em>Hymns,</em> #846. It will help us to read, pray, and sing this hymn:</p>

<p>This hymn has six stanzas, and each stanza has a particular word. In the first stanza it would be good to highlight the word <em>independence</em>. The second stanza has the word <em>seclusion,</em> the third stanza has the word <em>self-deception,</em> and the fourth stanza has the word <em>pretension</em>. Independence, seclusion, self-deception, and pretension are four things we have to overcome. These are the elements of our spiritual cancer. Verses 5 and 6 are on the positive side. Verse 5 mentions coordination and verse 6 has the word <em>building</em>. After the four negative things are cut off, we have the positive things&mdash;coordination and building. We need to sing #847 with the release of the spirit. We should not sing in a dying way. We need to sing in a releasing way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING OUR PRAYER<br />
WITH THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT<br />
AND THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we attend the meetings, we should always pray. We have pointed out that many of us have a bad habit of explaining in our prayer. We need to learn to drop this explaining from our prayer. We come to the Lord in prayer to ask, to beseech, to petition, to beg, Him, not to explain to Him. The Lord does not need us to explain things to Him. He knows everything. You may say, &ldquo;Lord, You know we are so poor.&rdquo; But you do not need to say this, because the Lord already knows. It is better to change your prayer by saying, &ldquo;Lord, have pity upon my poverty.&rdquo; This is a real prayer. To say, &ldquo;Lord, You know we are poor&rdquo; is explanation. Turn your prayer, from the first word to the last word, into petition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of us are used to praying too fast. Because of this, others are not able to follow our prayer. We have to pray in an audible and clear way so that others are able to hear us clearly. Then they will be able to say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to our prayer. We need to learn to pray without description, without explanation, and slowly and clearly enough so that others can follow us.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that we should not pray according to our natural way. When we pray, we have to exercise our spirit with every word. This does not necessarily mean that if we shout, we are exercising our spirit. But whenever we pray, we must exercise our spirit and the Spirit should be released out of us.</p>
<p>Most of us have never been disciplined in spiritual things. This is the reason for the poverty of the church. In the entire United States, it is hard to see an elder who really knows how to be an elder. This is because we have never found the time to have a training in specific things. We need such a specific training for the vital groups.</p>
<p>I hope that we would drop all of our old habits and our old thoughts. We should remember two things. First, when we pray, we need to petition, to supplicate, not to explain. Second, when we pray, we should pray by and in our spirit. Paul said in Ephesians 6:18 that we should pray at every time in spirit. A number of translations translated &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in this verse with a capital &ldquo;S.&rdquo; But the spirit here is not the Spirit with a capital &ldquo;S,&rdquo; but our spirit. We need to pray at every time in spirit, and watch unto this kind of prayer in our spirit. If we pray without being in the spirit, we have to adjust ourselves. When we pray, we must pray from our spirit. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). Whenever we come to the Lord, we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>We should learn to exercise our spirit to such an extent that even when we are quiet our spirit is exercised. According to Romans 8, we do not know how to pray as is fitting, so we groan. In our groaning, the Spirit groans also, interceding for us (vv. 23, 26). Our groaning in this way with the exercise of our spirit is the top prayer.</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s parable in Matthew 13:33, Christianity has been fully leavened. We have been contaminated by this leaven. The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 13 that He came to sow the seed of the wheat, but then the enemy came in. First, the enemy came in to devour the seed sown beside the way. Then some of the seed fell on rocky places which did not have the depth of earth. Other seed was sown among the thorns. The fourth category was the seed sown in the good earth to yield the proper fruit. The seed of the wheat eventually becomes the fine flour, but the fine flour became leavened.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:33 the Lord said that the entire three measures of meal, of fine flour, became leavened. This means that Christendom has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. The truths concerning such items as the name of Jesus, the gospel, salvation, regeneration, justification, and sanctification have become leavened. These items of the truth were not received by us in a pure way because they had become leavened. The Lord said in Matthew 13:33 that the woman took and hid the leaven in the three measures of meal until &ldquo;the whole was leavened.&rdquo; We must realize that in Christianity everything has been leavened. Even the way to pray has been leavened. In our prayer we have to be purified and purged.</p>
<p>We must learn to exercise our spirit in everything that we say and do. We must learn to exercise our spirit when we are shouting or when we are quiet. We must learn to exercise our spirit when we are praying by speaking or when we are praying by groaning. Our spirit should be exercised in everything. This takes practice. Even if people are going to play basketball properly, they need the continual practice.</p>
<p>After attending some of the group meetings we have established, I realize that all the saints need to be re-educated, to be purged. Now is the time for us to learn to drop the old way and the old things and to release our spirit. When we pray, we are not only praying to God. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 told us clearly that when we are praying to God, we are also praying for other people to understand (vv. 15-17). Not only God but also other people are listening to our prayer because they have to respond by saying &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Whenever we come to the meetings of the church, we should exercise our spirit to pray.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the members of the vital groups should endeavor to attend the prayer meeting of the church. In the 1960s when we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, at least seventy to eighty percent of those who attended the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting also attended the prayer meeting. Why could we have such a highly attended prayer meeting at that time, but not today? Some of the mothers may take their children as an excuse, but I would encourage the mothers to get together for babysitting so they can attend the prayer meeting on a rotating basis. Of course, the mothers need to care for their children, but they should not take this as an excuse for always missing the prayer meeting.</p>
<p>We need to care for the Lord and His interests above our consideration for our family (Luke 14:26). Abraham is an example of this. The Lord asked him to come out of Chaldea and from his relatives into the good land. But Abraham came out of Chaldea with his father Terah and with his nephew Lot, and they stopped at Haran. Eventually, Terah died, and then Abraham came into the good land (Acts 7:2-4). When Abraham was asked by God to get out of that idolatrous country, he could not leave his father or his nephew.</p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s nephew Lot also became a source of trouble to him. Lot eventually separated from Abraham and drifted into Sodom, where he became settled. He was captured and Abraham had to fight to defeat the capturing ones in order to recover Lot (Gen. 14:14-16). Later, Sodom was destroyed by God.</p>
<p>Before His destruction of Sodom, God came to Abraham, in Genesis 18, in the form of a man. Abraham prepared water for Him to wash His feet, and He had a meal with Abraham, prepared by Sarah. He stayed with Abraham in such a way for the purpose of rescuing Lot. We can see from the life of Abraham that we need to take care of our relatives, including our parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews, nieces, and children, in a proper way. Otherwise, we will suffer some dealing.</p>
<p>I am saying this to encourage all of us to attend the prayer meeting of the church. I would propose that four mothers come together for the purpose of babysitting so that they can attend the prayer meeting in a rotating way. Every month one sister among the four can take care of the babysitting for one Tuesday night. Then the three other sisters can be released to come to the prayer meeting. Even the church can consider doing something to help the mothers take care of this babysitting burden. We should not easily take an excuse for missing the prayer meeting. We have to be careful before God. To please God by attending the prayer meeting is the best thing. I hope that all of us would promise the Lord that we would attend the prayer meeting of the church.</p>
<p>Also, when we come to the prayer meeting, we must endeavor to pray. To come to the prayer meeting and not pray is meaningless. I would suggest that each of us pray at least three times in the prayer meeting. The Lord Jesus prayed three times in Gethsemane (Matt. 26:44), and Paul prayed three times (2 Cor. 12:8). Thus, we have to come to the prayer meeting, we have to pray, and we should pray three times. Whenever we pray, we must remember that we need to exercise our spirit for the release of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Even the sisters who play the piano in the meetings need to exercise their spirit when they play the piano. Your playing of the piano may sound like the playing of someone who is either sick, sleepy, or dormant. You need to play the piano livingly by exercising your spirit. When you play the piano, your whole being, all your muscles and all your cells, have to coordinate to release your spirit.</p>
<p>The practice of Christianity kills the living functions of the members of the Body of Christ. In Christianity only one person is cultivated to speak. They think that this has more impact. But actually the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ has the most impact. If we take this training for half a year, all of us will become living ones.</p>
<p>When we come together to meet, our whole being with our spirit should be living. Then if any visitors come to our meeting, they will be touched and inspired. A meeting full of the exercise of the spirit and the release of the spirit is the real church meeting. This is the meeting of the Body of Christ. When we come to a meeting, we should not sit there in a dead, dying, dormant, and sleepy way. Even when we are sitting in the meeting, our entire being should be living. We should be exercising our spirit and releasing our spirit all the time, even when we are not praying aloud.</p>
<p>We can say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in two ways: without the exercise of the spirit or with the exercise of the spirit. When we say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in the meetings, we should always say it with the exercise of the spirit and the release of the Spirit. Even the way we come to meet must be living. If we are not shouting, speaking, or praying, we should still exercise our spirit and release our spirit. If we look at someone with the exercise of our spirit, something living from us will penetrate that person. If we are living, we will inspire other people. If we are in the presence of a living person for even a short time, it will be hard for us to avoid being inspired by him. Therefore, we all have to learn how to exercise our spirit, how to stir up our spirit, and how to release our spirit. Even if we are merely sitting in a meeting, we should release our spirit. All of us have to rise up to function in a living way in order to annul the system of one man speaking and the rest listening. We have to come to exercise our spirit and to release our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELEASE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
AND THE PARTICIPATION IN THE OUTPOURING<br />
OF THE SPIRIT OF POWER</h2>
<p>The release of the Spirit leads us to the outpouring of the Spirit. We need to pray by exercising our spirit for the release of the Holy Spirit. If we do not exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit is locked and imprisoned inside our being. He has no way out because we have cheated Him. We believed in the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit, and the Spirit came into us. But when the Spirit entered into us, He entered into a prison. We imprison Him all the time. Now we have to exercise our spirit to release Him. When we exercise our spirit, that means we unlock the Holy Spirit. Today the key is not with the Holy Spirit. The key is with us. With the Holy Spirit there is no problem. We need to pray by exercising our spirit so that the Holy Spirit may be released.</p>
<p>This is related to the participation in the outpouring of the Spirit of power. The Holy Spirit first is the essential Spirit, the Spirit of life. Second, the Holy Spirit is the outpoured Spirit as the economical Spirit of power. We need to participate in the outpouring of the Spirit of power as the power from on high and as the dynamic impact. The power from on high is the real dynamic impact, and this comes from exercising our spirit so that the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, can be released. The release of the Holy Spirit will usher us into the participation in the outpouring of the Spirit of power. The outpouring of the Spirit of power as the power from on high and as the dynamic impact is for preaching the gospel and ministering Christ to others.</p>
<p>We have to see that the one divine Spirit is of two sides: the inner side and the outer side, the essential side and the economical side. The essential side refers to the indwelling Spirit as our spiritual essence, our spiritual life, and our spiritual person. The Triune God Himself as the Spirit is the very essence and base of our spiritual life. Based upon this, we can go on to participate in the outpouring of the Spirit of power, who is the economical Spirit for God&rsquo;s economy. The Spirit within is for our essence; the Spirit without is for God&rsquo;s economy. The Spirit without is with us based upon the fact that He is the essential Spirit of life within us. Since we are regenerated, we have the first aspect of the Spirit within us as a base. Based upon this, when we exercise our spirit, the essential Spirit will be released, and this will lead us to the enjoyment of the outpouring of the Spirit of power. This outpoured Spirit is the impact for our preaching and for our ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying by Exercising Our Spirit<br />
for the Release of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Now that we have been regenerated, we need to realize that the Bible charges us to do one unique thing, that is, to pray. This is because to pray is to release the spirit. We may wonder what spirit we are releasing&mdash;the human spirit or the divine Spirit. My answer is this&mdash;when you release your human spirit, the divine Spirit is released, because these two spirits are no longer separate; they are one. &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). The divine Spirit and the human spirit are now altogether mingled as one spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Continuing Steadfastly in Prayer<br />
with One Accord</h2>
<p>Acts 1:14 reveals that the one hundred twenty continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer. This is not the private prayer, the individual prayer, but the corporate prayer. In our corporate prayer, we need the one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Continuing Steadfastly in the Teaching<br />
and the Fellowship of the Apostles,<br />
in the Breaking of Bread and the Prayers</h2>
<p>Acts 2:42 tells us that the early church continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. We should not think that prayer is the smallest item here since it is mentioned last. Actually, the last item is the conclusion, and the conclusion is the most important part. The prayer is more important than the teaching, than the fellowship, and than the breaking of bread. Without the prayer, we may have the teaching, the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, but we do not have a conclusion. In doing everything we need a conclusion. The prayer is the spiritual conclusion to our entire spiritual career. To our life, to our work, to everything within us, and to everything outside of us, the prayer is the conclusion. Thus, we have to continue steadfastly in this concluding prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Continuing Steadfastly in Prayer<br />
and in the Ministry of the Word</h2>
<p>Acts 6:4 tells us that the apostles made the decision to continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word. Here prayer is mentioned first. In Acts 2:42 prayer is at the end. Therefore, the prayer is both the ending and the beginning. It is both the conclusion and the start. We have to continue steadfastly in prayer.</p><h2 class="head3">Praying at Every Time in Spirit<br />
and Watching unto This<br />
in All Perseverance and Petition</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:18 the apostle Paul charges us to pray at every time in spirit and watch unto this in all perseverance and petition. While we are persevering in prayer, we have to petition. On the one hand, we are persevering, and on the other hand, we are petitioning.</p>
<p>Many things rise up in our environment to swallow up our prayer time. This is why we need to persevere. When we are praying, we should forget about answering the telephone or the knocking at our door. We are busy praying. We are taking care of the business with our King. In our prayer time we should have the attitude that we are with our King and we are fully occupied with Him. Because of this, we do not have the time to answer the phone or the door. This is an illustration of what it means to persevere in prayer and watch unto prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Always Rejoicing, Unceasingly Praying,<br />
in Everything Giving Thanks, and<br />
Not Quenching the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must always rejoice, unceasingly pray, give thanks in everything, and not quench the Spirit (1 Thes. 5:16-19). Paul puts these four things together. If you want to pray, you have to rejoice. If you want to pray, you have to give thanks in everything. And if you want to pray, you must not quench the Spirit. Rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, giving thanks in everything, and not quenching the Spirit go together. If you do not rejoice, you quench the Spirit. If you do not pray, you quench the Spirit. If you do not give thanks, you quench the Spirit. All the day long, you have to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; All the day long, you should give thanks in everything.</p>
<p>Suppose that you broke a cup in your kitchen. Would you say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, for the breaking of this cup&rdquo;? It may not be normal for us to give thanks in everything. But actually, not giving thanks is abnormal. We need to become normal Christians. To be silent in the meetings is abnormal, but to be exercised and living is normal. Christians have to shout, to rejoice, to sing, to praise, and to give thanks. This is normal.</p>
<p>Not many of us give thanks to the Lord when negative things happen. We have to learn to give thanks to the Lord in everything&mdash;in good things, in bad things, in positive things, in negative things, in gain and in loss. If someone heard you thanking the Lord when you break a cup, they might think that you are crazy. However, when someone says you are crazy, that means that he was inspired by you. He would never forget what he saw. The Bible charges us to give thanks in everything. To give thanks to the Lord in everything is actually very normal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Participating in the Outpouring<br />
of the Economical Spirit of Power</h2>
<p>We need to participate in the outpouring of the economical Spirit of power as the power from on high and the dynamic impact for preaching the gospel and ministering Christ to others (Acts 2:17-18, 33; Luke 24:49).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Based upon the Triune God as the Essential Spirit</h2>
<p>Our participation in the outpouring of the economical Spirit of power is based upon the Triune God as the essential Spirit dwelling in us, operating in us, living in us, making His home in us, supplying us, and filling us. We have such a Triune God working within us to carry out His career. God the Father as the Spirit dwells and operates in us (John 4:24; 1 John 4:13; Phil. 2:13); God the Son as the life-giving Spirit lives and makes His home in us (1 Cor. 15:45b; Gal. 2:20a; Eph. 3:17a); and God the Spirit dwells in us, supplies us, and fills us (Acts 5:3-4; Rom. 8:11; Phil. 1:19b; Acts 13:52). We have such a wonderful fact as a base.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All the One Hundred Twenty<br />
Being Filled with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>All the one hundred twenty were filled with the Holy Spirit for the Pentecostal preaching (Acts 2:4). This is the outward filling with the Holy Spirit as the economical Spirit for the preaching of the gospel with the dynamic impact.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Peter Being Filled with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, the economical Holy Spirit, for the preaching to the rulers and elders of Israel (Acts 4:8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">All the Disciples Being Filled<br />
with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>After beseeching, all the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit for speaking the word of God with boldness (Acts 4:31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Saul Being Filled with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Saul was filled with the Holy Spirit at the beginning of his Christian life to receive his sight and be baptized (Acts 9:17-18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Paul Being Filled with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit to rebuke the devilish magician (Acts 13:9-11).</p>
<p>For all of the above ministries in preaching the gospel and ministering Christ to others, we need the outward filling of the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit. Our participation in the outpouring of the economical Spirit of power is based upon the Triune God as the consummated Spirit dwelling in us, operating in us, living in us, making His home in us, supplying us, and filling us. But why do we not experience the outpouring of the Spirit? This is because we are short of prayer. Prayer is the bridge that bridges these two aspects together. We have the inward filling of the indwelling Spirit, but we do not have the outward power because there is no connection, no bridge, between these two things. Prayer is our bridge.</p>
<p>Some Pentecostal people would say that you have to fast and pray for many days for something to happen to you. But this is against the teaching of the Bible. The Bible says that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit came into us, Christ came into us, and God the Father came into us. All three of the Divine Trinity are now in us as our life, as our essence. They have become one with our person, our constitution, our being. The Bible unveils to us that the Triune God is now within us to be our essence, to be our element, and to be our constitution, mingling Himself with us to make us one with Him. Today we are divine persons. We are the mingling of humanity with divinity.</p>
<p>Since this is the case, why are we so silent, so useless, and so powerless? This is because we do not touch the outward aspect of the Spirit, the economical Spirit. In order to touch this outward aspect, there is the need of a connection, a bridge, and this bridge is our prayer. We should abandon the Pentecostal concept of having to pray for many days with fasting in order to receive the power from on high. We need to pray not just for a period of many days but every day. We need to pray every day of the year. In other words, we need to pray unceasingly. We may wonder what we should pray for, but we do not need to make up our mind to pray for anything. To pray unceasingly is to have uninterrupted fellowship with God in our spirit. When we pray unceasingly, rejoice always, and give thanks in everything, this will make us &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo; When we are crazy, we have the power and the impact.</p>
<p>If we go to visit a candidate of the gospel in a religious way, we are through. To go in this way is to go as a corpse. But when we go to visit people in a crazy way, we have the power and the impact. On the one hand, we should be the most crazy people, but on the other hand, we should be very formal and proper. The real impact comes from our prayer. In the entire New Testament, you cannot find a person who received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit without first receiving the essential Spirit within. If we exercise our spirit to pray, the outpouring will be ours, making us different persons.</p>
<p>If we do not pray, we will be abnormal. In the past we were very abnormal, because we were not living. We have the Spirit within us, Christ within us, and God the Father within us, but we are not living because we do not pray. Only one thing today can make us living, and that one thing is prayer. We must pray unceasingly.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 shows us that the church is the Body of Christ and that the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father are within the Body and mingled with the Body. Thus, these four have become one: the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father. This oneness is the impact. This oneness is actually the power from on high. As the Body of Christ, we have the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father, and we are mingled with the Divine Trinity. Through our prayer, we will be ready to go to reach people, because we will participate in the power from on high as the dynamic impact.</p>
<p>When we participate in the outpoured Spirit, our meetings will be dynamic, our prayer will be dynamic, our preaching will be dynamic, and our ministry will be dynamic. Everything we have will be dynamic because the Triune God mingling Himself with us is the dynamo. He is the dynamo&mdash;the &ldquo;pum, pum, pum&rdquo;&mdash;within us. But today we cannot hear the &ldquo;pum, pum, pum.&rdquo; Instead, when we come to the meeting, it seems that everyone is dying. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s epistle to the church in Sardis, in which He told them that they had a name that they were living, but actually they were dead (Rev. 3:1-2). They were not only dead but also dying. Their death had not yet been accomplished, so they were dying. We have to admit that our meetings were often dying. Even our visitation and our preaching were dying.</p>
<p>The key to make you living is for you to pray, and to pray mainly is to exercise your spirit. When you teach the Lord in your prayer, when you explain to Him, and when you describe a lot in your prayer, there is no impact because that kind of prayer is not the unlocking of the Spirit. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I want to be living. Give me the impact, Lord.&rdquo; The Lord in Gethsemane prayed three times, and each time the prayer was short. We all have to pray in these days, &ldquo;Lord, I want to be living.&rdquo; While the sisters are in the kitchen cooking or washing the dishes, they should say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to be living. I want to have the impact, Lord.&rdquo; Do not pray for too many things and do not explain to the Lord, because He already knows. Just petition Him and tell Him what you want according to His desire. We also need to give thanks in everything. On a dark day, give thanks; on a shining day, a bright day, give thanks. If good things take place, give thanks; if bad things take place, give thanks. This is what it means to pray.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">SOME VITAL POINTS CONCERNING<br />
THE VITAL GROUP PRACTICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR TRAINING TO<br />
CARRY OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>In order for us to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we need to be trained. In our practice of the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are very free. If we are too free in doing things, we are through. The proper things to be accomplished must have a definite goal with the strict control. If we each have the freedom to work according to what we feel is right, the work is finished.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we pay much attention to spirituality. Brother Nee and I have given hundreds of messages on this line, stressing that we should not do anything according to our way or by our energy, but by prayer and by trusting in the Lord. This is very good, but we may use prayer and trusting in the Lord as an excuse for taking the freedom to do what is right in our own eyes. We may say that because we do not feel a certain matter is of the Lord, we will not do it. Thus, we have the freedom to do what we want. In the recovery today, there is freedom everywhere.</p>
<p>The United States is a country of freedom, but those in the United States military service give up their freedom. When you enter into the military, they cut your hair and give you new clothes to wear. In the military, you have no choice, no preference. You have no freedom to do what you want. Those who are in the military suffer the loss of their freedom for the sake of defending the whole country. They are under a strict training. To raise up the vital groups properly, there is the need of training. We have formed these vital groups because we have no way to get through with the church in a general way.</p>
<p>The training meeting is not a church meeting. To a church meeting, you may come late, and no one will say anything to you, but to a training meeting, you are obligated to come on time. We should be aware of the difference between the training and the church meetings. In the training we are willing to give up our freedom so that we can be perfected to be more useful to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING BY RELEASING OUR SPIRIT<br />
UNCEASINGLY TO REDEEM OUR TIME</h2>
<p>In this message I would like to begin to have some practical training for the vital groups. Prayer is greatly needed. We should pray not only when we come together in our vital groups but also in our private time. We have to learn how to use our time for prayer. We might take the excuse that we are too busy, but everyone on this earth is busy. Even a beggar might tell you that he is busy. We may think that when a person loses his job, he will no longer be busy. When he loses his job, however, he may be busier.</p>
<p>Many things on this earth need us and demand our time. Because many things require our time, we must exercise to redeem it. We can waste time in many small things. A person may take either two minutes to comb his hair or twenty minutes. It depends upon which way he does it. Some young people may spend twenty-five minutes to comb and style their hair. This is an illustration of how we can waste our time.</p>
<p>We may say that we do not have the time to pray because we are too busy. But when we receive a phone call, it seems that we are no longer busy. We have much time to talk on the phone freely. Quite often, I told people that the telephone is very &ldquo;sticky.&rdquo; It seems that when people get on the phone, they cannot get off. If we would love prayer and consider prayer the way that we consider talking on the telephone, we would have much time to pray. It is a lie to say that we do not have the time to pray. We have the time to do many other things, but we have a kind of habitual idleness when it comes to prayer.</p>
<p>In order to be useful, functioning members of the Body of Christ, we must learn how to redeem our time (Eph. 5:16). Day by day, we are losing our time, so we have to redeem it. We must cut off our long conversations on the telephone. Furthermore, when we are having a time with the Lord to pray, it is best to take the phone off the hook. Our prayer time is very important, so during that time we should not accept any phone calls. In the vital groups, the first thing we need to learn is to pray. In order to redeem our time, we need to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). If we do not pray, our groups cannot be vital.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR OUR CONCEPT TO BE CHANGED<br />
TO REALIZE THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME AND LABOR<br />
TO GAIN REMAINING FRUIT IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>First, we need to learn to pray. Second, we have to change our concept, the concept of thinking that people can be saved and brought into the church life in a quick way. Of course, people can be regenerated in an instant. But it is difficult to find a proper believer who has not had the adequate care. As members of the vital groups, we have to drop the thought of gaining quick and easy results.</p>
<p>We need the adequate time and labor to raise up the new believers. We must be prepared to spend two years to get someone saved, nourished, fed, raised up, and to some extent perfected to be one who is fully in the church life. If you can gain one sinner to the extent that he is fully in the church life as a normal member within two years, this is wonderful. We have to get ourselves prepared psychologically to take the laboring way.</p>
<p>We should not think that we can have an overnight &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; in the gospel. You may think that you are being trained to be &ldquo;magicians&rdquo; who can instantly bring in big results, but this concept is wrong. We are being trained to be the laboring ones. To gain someone and care for him until he is fully established in the church life is not an easy thing. We must realize that we probably will need more than two years to get a person saved, nourished, and growing up to such an extent that he would remain in the church life. You need to get yourselves prepared. Do not go out hoping that you could make an instant fortune.</p>
<p>When someone is saved by you, that person becomes your spiritual child, your babe. If you do not have this consideration, you will not be able to keep that person in the church life. In January of 1993, we hope to begin to go out for the preaching of the gospel. We should not expect that within 1993 we will gain one person who is solidly in the church life. I am not speaking of merely getting someone to believe in Christ and be baptized within one year. That is not very difficult. But to gain one who would remain under your care, learn the teachings of the Bible, be willing to be nourished by you, and be fully brought into the church life is not easy.</p>
<p>We need to gain someone whom we consider as our child. This makes a big difference. Before some sisters have children, we may wonder how they could have the ability to raise up children. But when they have children, they become different. When they have a child, they are for nothing but that child. We must take care of our new ones by considering them as our babes.</p>
<p>Paul told the Thessalonians that he was like a nursing mother cherishing them as his children (1 Thes. 2:7). He told the Corinthians that he was their spiritual father who had begotten them through the gospel (1 Cor. 4:15). His Epistle to Philemon shows us the way to take care of a new one. We all have to change our concept. In the Lord&rsquo;s work, we should not expect quick results. Actually, in the physical realm, it takes eighteen years to take care of one child. Then that child is considered as an adult. Since it takes this long to raise up a child in the physical realm, how can we expect to raise up a child of God, a Christian, within half a year? If we want the increase and the remaining fruit, we have to realize two things: first, we need to pray for our child; then we have to take care of this child.</p>
<p>For the long run, it is not profitable to beget many children in a quick way. God ordained that people bear children in a slow way. God created only one man, and God told this man to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the entire earth (Gen. 1:28). Man has filled the earth to such an extent that many people are concerned about the increasing population. Spiritually speaking, however, we are short of children because we do not practice the God-ordained way to gain the increase. We just practice something according to our way, according to our taste.</p>
<p>We may go out to preach the gospel and save someone. After spending some time with this new one, however, he may not have any desire to go on with the Lord. Then we may go out and get another one saved, but after three months this one moves away. These kinds of experiences may discourage us and cause us to lose our desire to gain the increase. We may want to forget about endeavoring to gain the increase because we have tried and failed. This is the reason we need the training. This training will prepare us to gain people for the increase and building up of the church. If we take the way of labor, laboring and laboring without focusing on the results, we will be very fruitful. If a brother is thirty years old today and the Lord gives him forty more years to live, he could gain fifty people as remaining fruit within these forty years. We need to labor and labor according to the way of the training.</p><h2 class="head1">DROPPING OUR OWN WAY<br />
TO PICK UP THE TRAINED WAY</h2>
<p>Another point I would like to make is that we must drop our own way. If someone wants to learn a trade like carpentry, he must drop his own way and pick up the trained way. He must learn the trade of carpentry according to his instructor&rsquo;s way. Otherwise, he will be a failure. We should not think that it is easy to preach the gospel to get sinners saved. We should preach the gospel, but we cannot do it according to our natural way. We have to learn to preach the gospel in a trained way, not in a way that is according to our disposition, character, and peculiar traits.</p>
<p>All of us have our particular disposition, character, and peculiar traits. These three things annul us in everything. Some sisters among us are nurses. They cannot be good nurses if they work according to their disposition, their character, and their peculiar traits. Depending upon the nurses&rsquo; disposition, the patients can be either helped or damaged by them. A nurse with a proper disposition can make the patient happy. Many nurses, however, do not make their patients feel happy and pleasant, because of their particular disposition. This shows us that in taking care of people for the gospel, we must learn to deny our self, which includes our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. We must learn to preach the gospel, not according to our way but in the trained way.</p>
<p>In our prayer these days, we need to pray for three things. First, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, teach me how to redeem my time.&rdquo; The only way to redeem our time is to pray. Thank the Lord that nothing is as convenient as prayer. We can pray everywhere. While we are driving our car, we can pray. We can redeem the time throughout the day by prayer.</p>
<p>Second, we need to pray that our psychology would be changed. We must be prepared to realize that it will take time to gain people as remaining fruit in the church life. But there is a principle in the whole universe that as long as we preach, people will believe. This is a principle set up by God. Thus, we have to pray and to preach in a laboring way.</p>
<p>Third, we also need to pray that we will not preach according to our way but according to the trained way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ATTENDING THE MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH, ESPECIALLY THE PRAYER MEETING</h2>
<p>The members of all the vital groups also have to attend the regular church meetings. In particular, all of us have to endeavor to come to the prayer meeting. We have to do something to rescue the prayer meeting. We have been practicing the church life in the United States for about thirty years. Over this period of time a negative habit has been built up. This negative habit is that most of the church members despise the prayer meeting.</p>
<p>All of us need to do our best to come to the prayer meeting. Because of this training with the vital groups, the church prayer meeting here has been greatly helped and rescued. I have been praying nearly every week that the Lord would increase the attendance in the prayer meeting.</p>
<p>Also, when we come to the prayer meeting, we are obliged to pray and to pray not just once. Do not pray long prayers. You do not need to compose anything. Simply tell the Lord what you want. Some saints&rsquo; prayers have too much composition. Their prayers are not spontaneous. Never forget that it is easier to get an answer to a short prayer. The best prayer is one with short sentences. Some saints have long sentences in their prayer. But we do not need to give the Lord reasons and explanations in our prayer. He already knows these things, so we should simply tell Him what we want.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DENYING OUR DISPOSITION IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Some saints among us are too bold in the meetings. They are bold to direct others to sing a certain hymn and then direct them to sing it over again. But the hymn that they called and asked the saints to sing again was the wrong hymn. If we ask the saints to do this, we must have a sense that the atmosphere of the meeting indicates that all the saints would like to sing this hymn again. Then when the saints are asked to sing it again, they will be happy about it. We need to learn to sense the atmosphere and taste of the meeting. If certain bold ones would cut off their long prayers and stop giving instructions in the meeting until they learn how to sense the taste and the atmosphere of the meeting, their spirit would be built up.</p>
<p>The bold ones among us need to deny their bold disposition. Likewise, the timid ones among us need to deny their timid disposition. Their timidity greatly annuls their function. When they speak, they should exercise boldness to speak in a stronger tone. When they speak and function softly, that does not build up their spirit. If they try to function in a stronger way, that will build up their spirit and cause them to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We have to realize that the meetings are the coming together of God&rsquo;s children to worship Him. John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit. Every church meeting is a time for us to do things in the spirit, because that is the time to worship God. The only principle, the basic, strict principle, in worshipping God is that we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>We need to exercise our spirit all of the time in the meeting. Whether we speak or not, we must exercise our spirit. If we do not speak, this should be because the Spirit leads us not to speak. When we speak, we speak also because of the leading of the Spirit. Thus, all that we do in the meeting should be the issue of the exercise of the spirit. But we are so neglectful about this matter. We may exercise our spirit only when we feel we have to pray or speak something, but we must exercise our spirit at all times. I am nourished in every meeting because regardless of whether or not I function, I am in the meeting in the Spirit with the exercise of my spirit. Because I exercise my spirit, I enjoy others&rsquo; spirits. When you are in the spirit, I sense it. When you are not in the spirit, I also sense it. We all need to learn and build up the habit of exercising our spirit at all times.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ANOTHER EARNEST TALK CONCERNING<br />
THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF REGENERATION, TRANSFORMATION,<br />
AND CONFORMATION TO BE A NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>The basic revelation of the New Testament is that we, the descendants of Adam, regardless of whether we are sinful or righteous, of whether we are good or bad, are altogether the old creation. Whether you are good or bad, you need to be regenerated. Even if we were not sinful, we would still need to be regenerated. Many have the concept that we need to be regenerated because we are evil. But all people, regardless of whether they are good or evil, need to be regenerated.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 we see two trees&mdash;the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (v. 9). This shows that good does not belong to life. Good belongs to Satan. God&rsquo;s intention is not to have a good man. His intention is to make a new man out of the old man. This is why we need to be reborn, to be regenerated with the divine life. The basic thought of the New Testament revelation is that we need to be a new person.</p>
<p>Nicodemus was a moral, high-class person who considered Christ as a teacher who had come from God (John 3:2). This indicates that he might have thought that he needed better teachings so that he could improve himself. But the Lord Jesus responded to him by saying, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). To be born anew is to be born again, which is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life different from the human life received by natural birth.</p>
<p>After being born again, we are still mostly in the old creation, so the Bible continues to show us that after regeneration we need to be renewed (Eph. 4:23; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 4:16). Second Corinthians 3:18 shows us that as we behold the Lord with an unveiled face, we are being transformed into His image. Romans 8:29 tells us that we need to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. The model to which we are being conformed is Christ as the firstborn Son of God. He is altogether different from the natural man, from us. We need to be renewed, transformed, and eventually conformed to Christ&rsquo;s image. After we have been regenerated, we may be loving the Lord and seeking after Him. We may be very religious, pious, and even &ldquo;godly,&rdquo; but we are in the old creation. We all need to be renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMATION NEEDED<br />
IN THE WAY OF OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p>This is why I have done my best to adjust the way you pray. Our former way of prayer was not the prayer from the new creation but the prayer from the old creation according to the old and natural way. Now I would like to read and comment on something Brother Watchman Nee spoke in his fellowship concerning the prayer ministry of the church. Brother Nee said:</p>
<p class="indent1">During our prayer, we must also guard against the prayers that are not prayers.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, in prayer we must be broken. To be broken means to be finished. To be broken means &ldquo;No more I, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20a).</p>
<p>I want to emphasize Brother Nee&rsquo;s word that we should guard against the prayers that are not prayers. We may pray much, but what we pray may not be real prayer. This is why I have adjusted our prayer. We may think that as long as one prays, that is wonderful. When someone prays, we may feel that merely because he has prayed, that is prayer. But Brother Nee said that during our prayer, we must guard against the prayers that are not prayers.</p>
<p>Brother Nee continues:</p>
<p class="indent1">Satan will not only take away our time of prayer, but also strip us of the strength to pray. He will come in even while we pray to make us speak many unrelated, confused, unimportant, and vain words. He will cause us to ask in vain and to waste our time of prayer.</p>
<p>These unrelated, confused, unimportant, and vain words can be uttered when we pray long prayers. Long prayers are full of such words. Satan uses these long prayers to exhaust us, to strip us of our energy. We may pray for ten minutes, but these ten minutes could be a waste of our time.</p>
<p>Brother Nee continues:</p>
<p class="indent1">He will try to occupy our time of prayer so that the effect of our prayer will amount to nothing. Many fleshly, old, long, mundane, heartless, and aimless prayers are time-consuming and wasteful prayers.</p>
<p>The word <em>mundane</em> does not merely mean commonplace but worldly, natural, and fleshly. Something mundane is not spiritual but fleshly, not sanctified or heavenly but worldly. Such mundane and long prayers are time-consuming and wasteful prayers. We should realize that many times in our meetings in the past, our prayers were like this.</p>
<p>Brother Nee went on to say:</p>
<p class="indent1">It may seem that we are just praying out of habit. But actually within these prayers are suggestions, instigations, and deceptions of Satan.</p>
<p>Brother Nee was more strict than I am. He considered that in these long prayers, there were even suggestions, instigations, and deceptions of Satan.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p class="indent1">If we are not watchful, our prayer will become meaningless and fruitless. One brother mentioned a story he read in the biography of Evan Roberts. Once a few people were in his home praying for something. Halfway through one brother&rsquo;s prayer, Mr. Roberts went over and covered that brother&rsquo;s mouth, saying, &ldquo;Brother, don&rsquo;t go on. You are not praying.&rdquo; The brother reading this story said within himself, &ldquo;How could Mr. Roberts do this?&rdquo; But later he realized that Mr. Roberts was right. Many words in our prayers are spoken by the flesh through the instigation of Satan. These prayers may be long, but many of them are impractical and useless. Brothers and sisters, this is a fact. Many times in our prayer, we seem to circle around the whole world. Time is wasted and strength is exhausted, yet nothing that is to the point is prayed about. We cannot expect God to answer this kind of prayer. This kind of prayer does not have any spiritual value. Hence, when we pray, we have to be watchful and not spend too much time or give too many reasons.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should not give too many reasons. Instead of giving the Lord a description with many reasons, we should simply tell Him what we want. Recently in a co-workers&rsquo; meeting, I told the brothers that their prayer was much improved. But a few co-workers still like to give the Lord many reasons in their prayer. We do not need to give the Lord the reasons why we need power. We should simply pray, &ldquo;Lord, give us the power.&rdquo; The reasons are just a decoration to our prayer. We decorate our prayer with many reasons which make our prayer wasteful.</p>
<p>Brother Nee goes on to tell us how we should pray:</p>
<p class="indent1">Rather, we should speak what is in our heart to God in a sincere way. We must never fill up our prayer with many empty words.</p>
<p>This shows us that we need to be transformed not only in our daily life but also in our prayer in the meetings. A few saints among us were used to praying many times in the prayer meeting with long prayers. This means that their prayer was short of transformation.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO BE TRANSFORMED IN EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>A number of you have outwardly been adjusted in your prayer, but I am concerned that you have not been transformed and conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. I am concerned that you may be outwardly behaving. To behave in this way is to pretend, and pretense is a lie with nice clothing. You may have a certain outward appearance as a cloak, but there is no real transformation taking place within you. We need to be transformed in our prayer, in the way that we worship, and in our meeting life. We need to be transformed in everything.</p>
<p>The New Testament requires us to be regenerated, to be renewed, to be transformed, and to be conformed to another One&rsquo;s image, to the image of the firstborn Son of God. Who is this firstborn Son of God? He is the One who, as both God and man, has passed through death and resurrection. As the very God, He became a man, and He was a perfect man; but even this perfect man had to pass through death and resurrection. Death and resurrection transformed Him.</p>
<p>Before His incarnation Christ, the divine One, already was the Son of God (John 1:18; Rom. 8:3). By incarnation Christ put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity. That part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity (Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5). We need to be transformed and conformed to the image of such a One who has passed through death and resurrection to become the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SELF NEEDING TO BE DENIED</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus also told us that if we want to follow Him, we have to deny ourselves (Matt. 16:24). The self includes all of our seclusion, individualism, disposition, character, and peculiarity. The self is our entire natural person. We have to deny ourselves not only in prayer but also in everything. In the church life, a number of us behave and act according to what we are, and what we are is absolutely natural.</p>
<p>You might be a very nice person, but your niceness is an offense to the Spirit. You are nice, but you are not in the Spirit. You are nice, but you are nice in your self, in your natural life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REAL CHANGE IN TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>Some have been in the recovery for years, but there has been no real change within them. They may have changed a lot from being bad to being good. That was the change we saw. But this is not the change by transformation from the old creation to the new creation. We welcome the change that comes by transformation. But we do not welcome the change from being bad to being good. We need a change from the old creation to the new creation. We do not want a mere outward change. Transformation is something inward, dealing with the constitution of our being. Transformation implies a kind of metabolism; it is an inward change by the addition of a new element into the very essence of our being.</p>
<p>There are many things related to us and to our service in the church life which are not in the Spirit. They may be nice things and even good things, but they are not in the Spirit. We need transformation. Otherwise, the church life cannot exist as it should. What is existing among us to a great extent is something natural, from the old creation.</p>
<p>We may have many good things in the church life, but the Bible puts good together with evil in the category of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Both good and evil are of the same category, of the same tree. There is another tree which is so simple&mdash;the tree of life. Life is purely God, so the tree of life is the tree of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S PATTERN</h2>
<p>Paul told us that before he received the Lord, he had attained to the top of his religion (Gal. 1:14). He even said that he had become blameless with respect to the righteousness which is in the law (Phil. 3:6). Paul was blameless according to man&rsquo;s judgment, but eventually he said, &ldquo;I have been crucified.&rdquo; Regardless of whether I am bad or good, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20a). Thus, in our prayer and in everything we do in the church life, we should have the assurance that it is not our doing, but the doing of another One, who has passed through death and resurrection and who is now living in us. This is what it means to live a life of transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE CRUCIAL POINTS FOR OUR SEEKING</h2>
<p>The vital groups have been in existence for nine weeks. Thus far, I have passed on mainly five things for you to seek after.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking to Be Blended</h2>
<p>First, we need to be blended by much and thorough prayer in love. This blending is not once for all. We have to practice this blending until we see the Lord. We are not yet thoroughly blended. In order to be blended, we need to release our spirit.</p>
<p>Actually, when I say that we need to be released, this does not only mean to pray. When we come together in the vital groups, we should release ourselves by opening up to one another. We may have been with one another for years, but we do not really know one another. Instead, we like to hide ourselves in certain things from the saints. I am afraid that not one of us is really open. All of us are pretending to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; members of the vital groups. We may show up on time and behave ourselves as nice ladies and gentlemen, but this is seclusion. We do not want to talk openly with the saints in our vital group because we are secluded. To talk openly with the intimate and thorough fellowship in Christ is to be released.</p>
<p>We do not open up to others, because we are afraid to be known by them. As a result, we cannot receive the inner healing from the Lord. We may be sick of &ldquo;gangrene,&rdquo; but we want to cover and hide our sickness from others. We need to realize that the other members of our vital group are our doctors. If we open ourselves up in a proper way to the other saints in our group, we will be healed. But instead of opening up, everyone is hiding. Some of us are released, but we are not absolutely released, because we are not used to being open to others. We are not open, but closed and secluded.</p>
<p>When we come together, we may feel that there is not much to do. I have said that the group meetings are eighty percent of the church life, and the first item of the group meetings is to come together to fellowship in an intimate, thorough, and spontaneous way. Maybe a sister would open up by saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tolerate my children. Would you tell me how to overcome my temper?&rdquo; Why would we not open up to one another in this way? Instead of seeing a scenery of intimate fellowship in the vital groups, I see a very behaving scenery. Everybody behaves. No one wants to make a mistake. Everyone wants to be a &ldquo;good boy&rdquo; and a &ldquo;good girl.&rdquo; I have seen this for many years, and I am disgusted with this. I want to see a group of seeking saints coming together to gain the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>But where can we see a group of saints practicing the New Testament revelation today? Who is denying himself? Who is being renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of the One who has passed through death and resurrection? Gradually, we have drifted into practicing a routine church life, but where is the Spirit and where is the leading of the Lord? There is not much leading of the Spirit among us. Instead, you act by your way, and I act by my way. You pray by your way, and I pray by my way. Who is going to be adjusted? Who is going to learn? If we are not inwardly adjusted and transformed, then where is the church life?</p>
<p>We have lost the impact in winning the sinners because we are a group of behaving people. We do not have the real spirituality as the power from on high, as the impact. In nearly everything, we have lost our spiritual impact. This is why we need a strict training. Otherwise, there will be no remedy to our situation. We love the recovery, we love the Lord, we love the church, and we are so good. We behave ourselves so that we do not offend anyone or make mistakes in the church life. But this is not the church life. This is a kind of top social club. The church life, however, is a group of Jesus-lovers who seek after Him.</p>
<p>These lovers of Jesus are ones who, after being regenerated, go on to learn the lesson of denying themselves in everything so that they can be renewed. They are living, serving, and meeting not by their doing and adjustment but by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s leading. They are being renewed even in the way they deal with their children and in the way they talk to their spouse.</p>
<p>A brother who is in the process of being renewed might confess, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I am wrong in my attitude, my inner feeling, my expression, my word, and my tone to my wife. All of these things are from the old creation.&rdquo; Our word might be right, but the tone in which we speak may be wrong. The tone is not in the Spirit. The husbands need such a confession to the Lord of their inner feeling, attitude, expression, tone, and word toward their wives. We need to confess to the Lord that our speaking to our wives is not in the Spirit. The brothers may be able to pretend before the saints, but they cannot pretend before their wives. Many times the husbands&rsquo; word to the wives is not spiritual.</p>
<p>This shows that we need to be transformed in everything. The Lord needs a group of people who have been regenerated, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the firstborn Son of God so that they can be built up together. This building is the Body and the practical church life.</p>
<p>I appreciate that the Lord has raised up so many churches on the earth, but the actual situation of the churches with respect to the practice of the God-ordained way is not that much up to the standard. This is why we need to raise up the vital groups. The remedy is here. In our vital groups, we must have much and thorough prayer to get ourselves blended with others in love. Whenever we come together, we should open up to one another to have an intimate and thorough fellowship.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking to Be Filled with the Spirit<br />
Inwardly and Outwardly</h2>
<p>First, we have to pray that we may be blended with others in love. Second, we must seek after the Spirit. We should pray continually, &ldquo;Lord, fill me up. Transfuse Yourself as the Spirit into my being, my constitution, and pour out Yourself as the Spirit of power upon me.&rdquo; We have to pray every day. This should be our practice until the Lord comes back.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying Unceasingly by Exercising<br />
Our Spirit to Redeem the Time</h2>
<p>Third, we have to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17) by exercising our spirit (1 Tim. 4:7) to redeem the time (Eph. 5:16). We need to practice this every day. A sister who is a housewife can pray while she is cooking or washing the dishes. This is to pray unceasingly.</p>
<p>We need to watch unto prayer because we are in a warfare every day. A mother may lose her temper with her children, but even if she would confess her defeat to the Lord, it is not a good model. The children may receive an impression that they cannot forget. Thus, they are offended, and the mother is a defeat before Satan. Daily our Christian life is a warfare. We are not fighting against blood and flesh but against the principalities, powers, and rulers in the heavenlies (Eph 6:12). Satan and his subordinates are observing what kind of life we live. They are watching to see how a sister treats her children and deals with her husband. This is why we need to pray all the time.</p>
<p>The unique way that we can release our spirit is to pray. We should not pray in our habitual, natural, repetitious, and composed way. We need to pray new items. If a sister has children, she can mention her children&rsquo;s names to the Lord three times a day. We can also pray for all the saints in the vital groups. Each saint should have a printed list of the names of all the saints who are in the vital groups. While a sister is washing the dishes, she can have this list nearby and pray, &ldquo;Lord, remember Sister So-and-so; remember Brother So-and-so....&rdquo; This is real prayer. This is not a composition. This is not long prayer that wastes our time and exhausts our energy. We can pray for the churches in Orange County, the churches in Southern California, the churches in the rest of California, the churches all over the United States, and the churches throughout the world. We need to pray unceasingly.</p>
<p>We should also pray to be renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ. Then we will gain a certain amount of transformation every day. We will not be the same as we were three years ago or even three days ago. Every day we need to be renewed, transformed, and conformed. This is the way for us to live Christ and to be built up as the organism of the Triune God. This is the real church life.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is enough to have left the denominations and to be meeting together on the ground of oneness. What about the content of the church life? Should we be satisfied with a church life in which we have a routine way to meet and a scheduled way to serve with all things done in our natural way according to ourselves? The elders may know that they need to do something, but they may not dare to touch or adjust some of the saints because these saints are easily offended. This is why I was forced to have such a training to raise up the vital groups. I have been speaking about the new way, the God-ordained way, for eight years, but not many practice it in a full way. In this training I must be faithful to speak the truth to you. I cannot cheat you. I hope that you would receive mercy from the Lord not to be offended but to be perfected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Doing Things in Our Own Way<br />
but in the Coordinated Way</h2>
<p>Fourth, we need to be perfected to do things in the coordinated way, not according to our own way. We cannot become qualified and equipped members of the vital groups overnight. We need months to build ourselves up. We have to pray that we can be blended, that we can be filled with the Spirit, that we can redeem our time by unceasing prayer, and that we can do things in the service, not according to our own way but according to the coordinated way, willing to give up our freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dealing with Our Disposition,<br />
Character, and Peculiar Traits</h2>
<p>Fifth, we need to pray for the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. These three things are the hardest things to deal with in the church life. We all have our self, and our self is constituted with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits.</p>
<p>I was glad recently to see some of us function who have been used to being silent in the meetings. Some of us have been coming to meetings for years in a silent way. We need to receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to have an inward, metabolic change of our quiet disposition. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me. Renew me and transform me. Transform me in every part of my being, in my daily life, and in my service to You in the church life. Transform me in the way that I pray, especially in the meetings.&rdquo; We need to realize that whatever we do out of our natural man is not acceptable to the Lord.</p>
<p>Some of the saints have been faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years, but they have remained the same. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:16 that we need to be renewed day by day. We should not be the same as we were three days ago. We need to become different daily by being renewed. If we never shout, we should be transformed to shout, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because we are remaining in our natural disposition, we cannot see the real church life among us. We have lost our impact and our influence. We are a group of people serving the Lord faithfully, but we are serving and meeting in a mere routine and scheduled way. As a result, there are no new ones under our care, and the church has come to a standstill. The remedy to this situation is with the vital groups. We all have to be transformed.</p><h2 class="head1">GAINING THE CANDIDATES<br />
FOR OUR GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<p>We need to begin to pray to gain the candidates for our gospel preaching. We need to make a list of our close relatives and acquaintances. Then we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, among these, who are the ones that I should take first as my candidates for Your gospel?&rdquo; The Lord will lead us. We should not take more than five people on our list as our initial candidates for the Lord to gain. It may be that out of these five, three would not be available. Regardless, we have to learn how to prepare ourselves and how to prepare our candidates, the objects of our work. We need to pray for them for about two months. Then we can go out to contact them.</p>
<p>This kind of selection and prayer for those whom we select will give us the impact with them. It is not the best thing to knock on &ldquo;cold&rdquo; doors, the doors of people we do not know. We must find a way to get &ldquo;warm&rdquo; doors, doors of people whom we know or who have been recommended to us by others.</p>
<p>We need to realize that the coming out of our labor can be counted rightly only in the future. Presently, all five whom we choose as our candidates may not be available. But after three years, they all will be available due to our prayer. We do not know when the Lord will fulfill our prayer. We should just labor. The apostle Paul promised us that our labor in Christ is not in vain (1 Cor. 15:58). I believe that every minute we spend for laboring in the Lord&rsquo;s service is recorded by the Lord.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament principle, not one person is saved directly. A person is saved through someone else or through someone else&rsquo;s prayer for him. God may have chosen your cousin and decided to save him. But if you do not pray for him, no one will pray for him. Thus, God will have no way unless you pray. Your prayer will pave the way and lay the tracks on which God&rsquo;s &ldquo;train&rdquo; can move. Prayer means a lot, so we have to pray for about two months. Then we will go out. Every day we must spend some time to get ourselves equipped, qualified, and prepared to do our duty in gaining sinners for the increase of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR TRAINING AND LEARNING<br />
IN ORDER TO PRACTICE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>After we choose our gospel candidates, we have to consider what book or what verses of the Bible we can use with them. This is why we need to be trained with the appropriate verses from the Scripture. Certain verses are good for one kind of person, and other verses are good for another kind of person. Then we have to be trained how to use these verses. John 3:16 is a good verse, but many do not know how to use it.</p>
<p>We also have to be trained in how to take care of the new ones we gain. Maybe the Lord would not give you a new one for one year. Then you will question the Lord by saying, &ldquo;Lord, why wouldn&rsquo;t You give me new ones?&rdquo; The Lord would say, &ldquo;I gave Sister So-and-so five new ones, and she cannot care for all of them. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you go help her by taking care of them?&rdquo; The mothers know that taking care of children properly requires much learning. We lost many new ones in the past because we were not the proper nursing mothers to take care of them. Eventually, we will come up to the point where we and the new ones under our care learn to prophesy.</p>
<p>I hope that we would consider this fellowship seriously. If the Lord cannot have a way with the vital groups, it will be difficult for us to go on. How many among us live according to what we have heard from the ministry? Many saints are not much in the process of being renewed, transformed, and conformed. Instead, they live and serve in the natural way. This is quite serious. We love the Lord so much, but we still keep our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. Since this is the case, there can be no real building among us. We need to receive the fellowship in these messages so that we can be renewed, transformed, and conformed to Christ&rsquo;s image. I hope that this fellowship will be fully apprehended and realized by us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO DENY OURSELVES<br />
AND FOLLOW THE INNER SPIRIT</h2>
<p>One brother told me that when he opens up to the saints, he feels that he deadens them. This is because he is too much in his natural life. When you open yourself up to others and in everything you do, you need to learn to follow the inner Spirit. In your prayer and in your activities in the meetings, you do not follow the Spirit. It is just your doing.</p>
<p>A brother may love the Lord to the uttermost, but it is hard for the Lord to get through in him because he is so strong in his natural life, in what he is. When he prays, he prays according to what he is. When he calls a hymn in the meeting, he calls it according to what he is. This shows that there is a great need for us to deny our self. In Matthew 16:24 the Lord told us that we must deny our self. But in Luke 14:26 the Lord told us further that we must hate our self, our soul-life. We are so natural. This means that we are out of the old creation. Anything that comes out of the old creation is fleshly and offensive to the Lord.</p>
<p>A brother who is strong and very bold in his natural life will take over the meeting. When he hears that we need to open up to one another, he will be the first in opening up. But he opens up to the saints in his natural life. To open up is right, but you have to open by following the inner Spirit. Do not forget that God is Spirit and those who worship God must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). You have to open to me and I have to open to you, but we all have to do this by following the Spirit. Therefore, there is much need to trust in Him.</p>
<p>Paul said that we should work out our salvation with fear and trembling because it is God who operates in us (Phil. 2:12-13). I have an operating One within me, so I am fearful that I may miss Him. I am trembling that I may offend Him, because He is not only with me but also operating within me. Thus, I am fearful, waiting, and on the alert, looking to Him. Paul uses the word <em>watch,</em> saying that we need to watch unto our prayer (Eph. 6:18). Even the matter of prayer needs the watching. Otherwise, I may pray wrongly. If I do not watch in my prayer, I may pray long prayers; I may pray prayers which are not prayers.</p>
<p>If we get into the revelation of the apostle Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles without seeing how the Triune God is the practical grace to us, we can be fully disappointed. This is because no one in himself can practice what Paul saw and taught. Who can live Christ and magnify Christ as Paul did? We can do this only by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21a). The all-inclusive, bountiful Spirit is within us, enabling us to live and magnify Christ.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING BURDENED WITH GOD&rsquo;S LOVING CONCERN FOR SINNERS AND WITH CONVERTING<br />
SINNERS INTO MEMBERS OF CHRIST<br />
FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h1>
<p>In the previous message, we pointed out five crucial points for our seeking in the vital groups. First, we need to seek to be blended with the other members of our vital group by having an intimate and thorough fellowship with much and thorough prayer. Second, we need to seek to be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly. Third, we need to pray unceasingly by exercising our spirit to redeem the time. Fourth, we need to learn to serve and work not in our own way but in the coordinated way by giving up our freedom. Fifth, we need to pray for the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. These five items are not like lessons which we can study and courses from which we can graduate. They are five daily necessities like our drinking, eating, breathing, sleeping, and exercise.</p>
<p>If we practice these things, our gatherings will be living and released. Spontaneously, we will be persons in the meeting who are releasing the Spirit in our praying, praising, singing, and speaking for the Lord. We will be enlivened and enlivening persons. We need the vital groups because of our dead and dying situation. Instead of enlivening others, we may deaden them. Our coming to the meeting may deaden the meeting. This is wrong. We should be those who enliven the meeting. Everybody should be released in the meeting. In order to be released persons, we must practice the above five items.</p>
<p>We need to exercise our spirit to pray unceasingly. This means that we should not waste our time. Instead, we need to fill up the gaps in our time with prayer. No one can say that they redeem and use every moment of every day. Today, generally speaking, Americans have much free time. This is why they spend time pursuing entertainment and worldly pleasures. Whenever our time is empty, we should fill it with prayer. This means that we should pray unceasingly. A person who prays unceasingly is a released person.</p>
<p>We have been helped in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to realize the daily spiritual practices we should have. We know how to call on the name of the Lord and how to talk to the Lord for the release of our spirit. The only need is for us to fill up our time with these practices.</p>
<p>Whenever we pray, we must release our spirit. I do not mean that we need to shout all the time, but when we pray in the meetings, our prayer should not be voiced in a common way. Even our voice must be exercised when we pray. Prayer means to release our spirit. If there is no release of our spirit, that is not prayer.</p>
<p>To pray and to praise are different. Praise requires us to be more released in our voice than prayer. In our translation of the Psalms, we use the term &ldquo;ringing shout&rdquo; (Psa. 71:23). According to the Bible, we people of God must be &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; ones who are joyfully praising Him every day (Phil. 4:4; 1 Thes. 5:16). If someone gave you a very expensive diamond as a present, you might be very excited, but we have something tremendously more valuable than this. We have Christ. Christ is so worthy and so rich. He is immeasurable, unsearchable, and untraceable. We have such a Christ, but do we have Him as our reality? We sing about how wonderful and rich Christ is, but do we really see and experience Him in such a way? Are we really crazy about Christ? We should not be old, cold, and stale, but fresh, living, young, and new in the Lord. In order to be living and vital members in the church life, we must practice the five aforementioned items all the time. Then our meetings will be filled with joyful shouting and rejoicing.</p>
<p>We need much preparation before we can have the impact in going out to reach people for the increase of the church. Although we may know the truth concerning the four steps of the God-ordained way, we have not properly practiced them. Few among us have properly practiced the preaching of the gospel. If we do not know how to do something, we cannot be interested in it. When a child is at the beginning stages of learning how to play the piano, it is difficult for him and he may not be that interested in it. But eventually, as he practices and learns more and more, he will become addicted to playing the piano. This shows that the more we practice, the more we learn, and the more we learn, the more we become addicted.</p>
<p>It seems that presently few among us have a real interest in the God-ordained way. We agree that the group meetings are eighty percent of the church life, but how many are really interested in the group meetings? We are still mostly in the old way. We have been practicing the vital groups for about ten weeks, and I am concerned that there are still some saints in your group whose full names you do not even know. This shows that we surely have not entered into a thorough and intimate fellowship with one another in order to be blended together. I hope that we would know not only the names of the ones in our particular group but also the names of the saints in all of the vital groups.</p>
<p>In these days I am greatly burdened for the raising up and the going on of the vital groups. We need to get ourselves prepared to go out to gain people for the increase and building up of the church. We should get ourselves prepared by making a list of our relatives and close acquaintances. Then we need to pray and ask the Lord which ones we should concentrate on first as candidates for our gospel service. The Lord will lead us. In these months we need to continually pray for them, and then we can go to contact them.</p>
<p>In order to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s burden in the vital groups, we must be renewed persons and we must learn how to serve the Lord in every way. To learn to be a medical doctor is difficult, but to learn how to serve the Lord according to His way is much more difficult than studying medicine. I have been learning how to serve the Lord for over sixty years, and I have still not graduated.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BURDENED WITH THE LOVING CONCERN<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S HEART TOWARD THE PERISHING SINNERS</h2>
<p>We have to learn to be burdened with the loving concern of God&rsquo;s heart toward the perishing sinners. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes into Him would not perish but have eternal life. God does have such a love. Now we as God&rsquo;s children should be one with our Father in His love for sinners. We need to have a loving concern for the salvation of sinners. The concept of preaching the gospel merely to win souls is too shallow. We need a loving concern for fallen man. According to my feeling, most of the saints among us have lost this concern and care for the sinners.</p>
<p>George Whitefield is an example of one who had a real concern for sinners. One day he was preaching concerning the eternal perdition of those who do not believe in Christ. He portrayed the lake of fire to such an extent that some in the audience were grasping the columns in the building in fear that they would fall into that lake of fire. He had such a heart, burden, and real concern for sinners, but we have mostly lost this concern.</p>
<p>Our vital groups should learn how to be burdened with our Father&rsquo;s loving concern toward the sinners. First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved. Before we go out, we must be equipped with this kind of feeling. Otherwise, we are hypocrites performing something. If we do not have a heart for the sinners, why would we go out to visit them? This would be a kind of performance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BURDENED TO CONVERT<br />
SINNERS INTO MEMBERS OF CHRIST<br />
FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In Romans 15:16 Paul said, &ldquo;That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Paul was a priest of the gospel who offered all the Gentiles to God as sacrifices. Paul was burdened to fulfill his ministry to convert the sinners into members of Christ. In the Old Testament, the priests offered cattle sacrifices as types of Christ. But Paul said that he offered to God the sinners saved by his gospel preaching as spiritual sacrifices, as members of Christ (1 Pet. 2:5). He did this for the building up of the Body of Christ to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>This is not just to have God&rsquo;s loving concern for sinners, but to pick up the burden to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. God has an economy, and that economy is centered on Christ with His desire to have a Body. Today it is difficult to see many who have a real burden for the Body of Christ. Today&rsquo;s evangelical work is just for soul-winning, but who cares for the building up of the Body of Christ? Paul preached the gospel for the increase and building up of the Body of Christ. He was a priest offering saved ones to God as the living members of the Body of Christ. We need to have such a burden.</p>
<p>In his first Epistle, Peter said that we are the living stones being built together into a spiritual house, and this spiritual house is a priesthood (2:5). A house is a corporate unit of many materials built together. We have to be such a built-up house. This is why we have to be blended. Then we can be a &ldquo;-hood,&rdquo; a priesthood, a Body. The word <em>priesthood</em> bears two denotations. First, the priesthood is the priestly service. Second, the priesthood refers to the priestly body, a group of priests serving together. In 1 Peter 2:5 the priesthood is not the priests&rsquo; service, but the priestly body, and that body surely is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says that the function of such a priesthood, the priestly body, is to tell out the virtues of the One who saved us, calling us out of darkness into His marvelous, wonderful light. God&rsquo;s virtues are His love, His kindness, His grace, His mercy, His patience, His forgiveness, etc. To tell out God&rsquo;s virtues is the preaching of the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in His virtues according to our experiences. The results of our preaching are the spiritual sacrifices, the saved sinners, mentioned in verse 5.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel is to tell out the virtues of our Savior, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. In order to preach the gospel in this way, we need much learning. The most basic thing is that we all have to be blended together. We are pieces of material who must be built up together into one house. Otherwise, we are not a priesthood. We might be priests, but not a &ldquo;-hood.&rdquo; This is why the first thing I told you to do is to get yourselves blended. How can scattered pieces of materials be a house? If we are not built up together to be a house, we are finished. God cannot use scattered or piled up pieces of material. God can use only a built-up house as a vessel in which He can dwell. Then this house is a &ldquo;-hood,&rdquo; a priesthood, and all the pieces of material are the priests built together. Even in the Old Testament, the priests were not scattered. The priesthood was a system. No one in that priestly system could act individually. Each priest had to act as a part of that system corporately.</p>
<p>We should not be burdened merely for the winning of souls. We must be burdened to gain more members for the increase of the Body of Christ and for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy. In Haggai 1:8 Jehovah charges His people by saying, &ldquo;Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house.&rdquo; The material is for the building up of God&rsquo;s temple, His house. This is a picture of the need to gain God&rsquo;s chosen ones as material for the building of His living house, His church, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The ones whom we save are God&rsquo;s chosen ones. Once they are saved, we need to work on them so that they may have a metabolic change in their being. We need to labor in the Lord so that sinners can be regenerated and then transformed and built up. We need to bring the ones whom we save into the church life, which is for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to preach the gospel for the increase of the Body of Christ, not to merely win souls. In John 3:30 John the Baptist declared, &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; At that time John the Baptist&rsquo;s disciples were jealous to see all the people going to Christ. When they reported this to John, he responded by saying that Christ must increase while he must decrease. He was saying, &ldquo;No one should come to me. Instead, all should go to Him to be His increase.&rdquo; The increase in this verse is the bride in verse 29, and the bride is the living composition of all the regenerated people. Regeneration makes us the corporate bride for Christ&rsquo;s increase.</p>
<p>Romans 12 reveals that the regenerated sinners should not be conformed to this world but should be transformed by the renewing of their minds to make them living members of the Body of Christ. Romans 12 shows us the practice of the Body life, and in the Body life we must be transformed. The transformed ones become the proper materials for the Body life. We are burdened to save sinners so that they can be regenerated and then transformed to be proper materials built up into the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Those of us in the vital groups need to have a twofold burden. One is the loving concern of the Father for sinners, and the other is the real burden for converting sinners into members of Christ. We cannot do these things lightly. We have to be very serious.</p>
<p>I am bearing a heavy burden because year by year, we cannot see much increase in the churches. Even when we do save some, it seems that we are merely winning souls instead of converting sinners into the members of the Body of Christ. Our burden is to get sinners converted for the building up of the Body of Christ. It is not an easy thing to convert a sinner into a member of the Body of Christ. This is why we need to get ourselves prepared, trained, and perfected, equipped. This is our burden in this vital group training.</p>
<p>We all need to be inwardly touched by the Lord. Then there will be an echo within us to God&rsquo;s love and to God&rsquo;s economy. Within God&rsquo;s heart are His loving concern for the fallen sinners and His desire to carry out His economy. This is a heavy burden for Him. Who today understands God&rsquo;s heart and is for God&rsquo;s heart? God&rsquo;s heart today is for only two things: to save sinners and to accomplish the building up of the Body of Christ. We know that this will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal. We must pray for these two points which I have mentioned here. If we do not pray and if we do not pick up this burden, it is meaningless for us to participate in the vital groups.</p>
<p>We have to be revolutionized in every way. All the members of the vital groups should not be passive but should be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly and should be exercising their spirit for the release of the spirit. Then we will be equipped, blended together, and ready to go out to gain the increase.</p>
<p>Now I have passed on seven items for us to practice every day. If we are going to participate in the vital groups, we must be willing to pay the price. This is not a common move or action in the church.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">MORE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE LIVING CONTENTS OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<p>We have pointed out that in the group meeting we should have the proper, intimate, and thorough fellowship with one another by exercising our spirit with much and thorough prayer. This is the first section of the vital group meeting, which should occupy about twenty-five minutes. In this section of the meeting, there should be the elements of fellowshipping and interceding, caring, shepherding, and visitation. The second section of the meeting, which should occupy about thirty minutes, is the teaching in mutuality with the mutual asking and answering of questions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING VITAL GROUPS,<br />
NOT FORMAL AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS</h2>
<p>I have stressed in the past that the group meeting should not be a formal, religious worship service. But after attending some of the group meetings, I have observed that we are still somewhat having a religious meeting, a worship meeting, a kind of service. This is because we are too formal. In the group meetings, we should fellowship freely, sing freely, pray freely, and ask and answer questions freely without formality. When we sing a hymn, we do not necessarily have to sing it in order from the first verse to the last verse. We may begin with the last verse or with any verse according to the leading of the Spirit. We should not sing the hymns in a dead way but in a living, exercised way with the release of our spirit.</p>
<p>We need <em>vital</em> groups, not formal, religious, and dead groups. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, make us vital in singing, vital in speaking, and vital in everything.&rdquo; The Psalms tell us that we need to give a ringing shout and make a joyful noise to the Lord (71:23; 100:1). Our habit of being formal limits us in the meetings of the church. We should be &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in the Spirit, but our craziness should be spontaneous and normal, not a kind of demonstration or performance. In our vital groups, we should be living and exercised in our singing and praying.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEACHING ONE ANOTHER IN MUTUALITY THROUGH THE MUTUAL ASKING AND ANSWERING OF QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Through the exercise and release of our spirit, we will spontaneously have some teaching in mutuality. A brother may say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, we recently heard from Psalm 68 about little Benjamin, the princes of Judah, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. Do you know what this signifies?&rdquo; This might become a subject raised up for your fellowship. We can have this kind of fellowship in many ways.</p>
<p>Another person may say, &ldquo;We were told that we need to be dealt with in our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. What is the difference between these three items?&rdquo; We have said that we need to deal with these three items, but how many of us know what they are? Our disposition is what we are in our natural being by birth. Our character is formed mostly according to our habit. We may be a slow person in our disposition according to our birth. But our doing things carelessly is not according to our birth but according to our habit by practice to become a part of our character. A person is careless because he has never been disciplined to do things in a careful way. We need a change in our practice for a change in our character. Our peculiar traits are our biased and warped characteristics as the expression of our natural life. To have the mutual fellowship about the significance of dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits can be very profitable.</p>
<p>In the vital group meeting, someone may say that he has a problem in understanding John 7. He may ask why John 7:39 says that &ldquo;the Spirit was not yet.&rdquo; Then the other members of the group can answer his question in a mutual way. We need this kind of teaching in mutuality with the mutual asking and answering of questions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSIDERING ONE ANOTHER SO AS TO INCITE<br />
ONE ANOTHER TO LOVE AND GOOD WORKS</h2>
<p>Verses 24 and 25 of Hebrews 10 are the basis for our practice of the group meetings. These verses say, &ldquo;And let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo; These verses first say that we need to consider one another. This implies that we have a genuine care for all the members of our vital group. To care for one another means to consider one another. Today we may not care for others. We do not really care whether or not a certain brother comes to the meeting or whether or not a certain sister is sick. The genuine care for one another needs to be recovered among us.</p>
<p>Proper wives always have their husbands in their consideration. A sister may make sure that her husband has a coat to wear as he is leaving the house. This means that she is considering her husband, caring for her husband. We need to have this kind of practical care for one another. To consider one another in a practical way is to love one another. We say that we love one another, but in what way do we love? We may not care for anyone in a practical way. Love means practical care and consideration. When we consider one another, we incite one another to love and good works. We stir up one another. If someone cares for me, that spontaneously stirs me up, incites me, to love and good works. <em>To love</em> here is not an infinitive. <em>Love</em> is a noun just as <em>good works</em> is a noun. We incite one another to love and good works by caring for one another, considering one another.</p>
<p>We need the intimate fellowship with one another with the practical care and shepherding. One sister may point out that another sister in the group is absent because she is having some particular trouble. After sharing with the other group members the nature of the problem, the group can pray for her and fellowship about how to give her the practical care and help.</p>
<p>If a brother has lost his job, we should pray for him. We should also consider his material situation. This is real love. James in his Epistle said, &ldquo;If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food, and any one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?&rdquo; (2:15-16). In his first Epistle, John said, &ldquo;But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness&rdquo; (3:17-18). If we see brothers who are in need and merely tell them that the Lord will take care of them, that is not love. That is vain talk. We should care for one another, consider one another, in a practical way.</p>
<p>This kind of care stirs up our love and our good works. These good works may refer to small things or big things which are related to God&rsquo;s economy. A saint in your group may not think about God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy seems too abstract and unattainable to him. He thinks that we talk much about God&rsquo;s economy, but that this has nothing to do with our present need in our daily life. Through our loving care for this brother, he will be incited to consider God&rsquo;s economy. Without such a loving care and consideration of one another, we may be very indifferent toward the things of God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ and the church. But once a brother is loved in some practical care, that impresses him and incites him to think about the Christian life and about God&rsquo;s economy. When a brother who is Italian cares for another brother who is Chinese, this is a marvelous testimony. This shows that the different races are swallowed up in the new man and testifies of the practical love among the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Paul said that we should consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together. Today our vital group meeting is our own assembling together. For the Hebrew believers at Paul&rsquo;s time to abandon their own assembling together would have been to return to the Jewish way of meeting and to abandon their assembling together as Christians. Paul exhorted them not to abandon their own assembling together as Christians. Hebrews 10:25 says that in the group meetings we should exhort one another, and so much the more as we see the day drawing near.</p>
<p>The first thing we have to do in the vital group meetings is to have a thorough fellowship together so that we can know the members of our group in an intimate way. The more thorough our fellowship is, the better. Do we know the occupations of the saints in our vital group and where each one works? Do we know the first and last names of every member of our vital group with their proper pronunciation? By considering these questions, we can see that our fellowship has not been thorough. To love one another involves a lot. We need to endeavor to know one another intimately in the Lord. If someone is absent from our vital group meeting, we should immediately ask where he or she is. We say that our group should be blended, but our blending has not been completed, because we do not know each other thoroughly. When you take action together in serving the Lord, you will see that this is very important. Week after week we have been meeting together, yet we still do not really know one another.</p>
<p>We should know each other&rsquo;s situation and condition in an up-to-date way. Then we will realize there is the need of practical care. If we realize a sister is sick, we can fellowship about how to render the proper and practical care to her. We can fellowship about who would be burdened to go or about who could and should go. In the larger prayer meetings of the church, we pray in a general way, but the prayer for one another in the groups is specific with a view to the practical care and shepherding. We may pray for a few minutes and then we can arrange for some person or persons to visit our sister. This is the shepherding. Later, the one who visits should let the group know the situation of this sister. This is what is implied when we say that the group meetings are eighty percent of the church life.</p>
<p>The new ones whom we bring to our group meetings will not merely be taught by us outwardly. They will observe our practice. This is similar to the children in a family learning things by observing the way the family lives and acts. The new ones will follow the pattern which they see and hear in our vital groups. This is why we must learn how to fellowship with one another and how to get ourselves released.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH OUR DISPOSITION,<br />
CHARACTER, AND PECULIAR TRAITS</h2>
<p>We also have to build ourselves up according to the seven points covered in the previous two messages. Specifically, we need to pray for the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. A brother may be born as a slow person. That is his disposition, so he needs to allow the cross to be applied to his slowness. He should even condemn his slowness. Sometimes people take the excuse that because they were born a certain way, they cannot help themselves. But we should not take such an excuse. If a person is born slow, he must learn to take Christ to do things quickly.</p>
<p>Our peculiar traits also frustrate our usefulness. In the Far East many years ago, there was a co-worker among us who had an outstanding peculiar trait. Brother Nee told me regarding this brother that if you wanted him to go east, you had better ask him to go west. He was a person who would do the opposite of what he was asked to do. That was his peculiarity. Each one of us has at least ten percent peculiarity in our disposition. When a brother asks his wife to close the door, she might say, &ldquo;Why not leave it open?&rdquo; When he asks her to open the door, she would say, &ldquo;Why not leave it closed?&rdquo; This is her peculiarity. Of course, the husbands also have their peculiarity. Everyone has peculiarities, so we all need the experience of the cross. If our disposition, character, and peculiarity are not dealt with, our group meetings will not be vital.</p>
<p>I believe that the vital group meetings will be greatly used by the Lord. In the church many of us love the Lord, love the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and love the church, but not many are really useful because of the defects related to our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. All these defects annul us, making us useless. This vital group training and the practice of the vital groups will make us useful in saving sinners, in nourishing the new ones, and in feeding the saints. We need to endeavor to put all the things we have covered in this training into our practice in the vital groups.</p>
<p>In order to deal with our disposition, character, and peculiarity, we need to see a vision that we have been crucified on the cross (Gal. 2:20a). We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that on the cross You have crucified my disposition, my character, and my peculiarity.&rdquo; We need to see a vision of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. By His mercy and grace we need to accept this vision and then proceed to live by the Spirit. In our daily life, the Spirit applies Christ&rsquo;s death to all the negative things in our being.</p>
<p>We have to learn practically in our daily life to be dealt with very finely in our disposition, character, and peculiarity. Sometimes we might think certain brothers and sisters have made some improvement, but their improvement is questionable. The real improvement must be because of the particular dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiarity. If we do not have some definite and practical experiences in this, we cannot have the real improvement in life. Over ninety percent of our growth in life depends upon the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiarity. Our daily lives are filled up with these three items.</p>
<p>Each of us has his particular disposition. One brother has his particular way to come to the meeting and to find a seat in the meeting. Even in coming to the meeting and finding a seat in the meeting, he does not obey the Spirit, but he obeys his peculiarity. If the usher would try to seat this brother in another place, this brother might be offended. We need to consider how often we obey the Spirit during the day. Mostly we act, move, and behave according to our disposition, character, and peculiarity.</p>
<p>Some brothers are very active people, so they like to move around in the meetings by helping to usher people to their seats and by caring for the distributing of the bread and wine at the Lord&rsquo;s table. Other brothers are very inactive people. Once they are seated, they do not want to be moved by anything or anyone. If you ask the brother who is active to be an usher, he will be very happy. If you ask the inactive brother to usher, he will say that he does not like this. Both of these brothers are acting and serving according to their disposition and not according to the Spirit. This shows that we have to die to ourselves so that Christ may live in us.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">MUTUAL TEACHING IN THE GROUP MEETINGS<br />
BY MUTUAL ASKING AND MUTUAL ANSWERING</h1>
<p>In this message we will touch the matter of mutual teaching in the group meetings by mutual asking and mutual answering. In the group meetings we do not promote anyone to be a particular teacher; rather, we desire to encourage all the group members to learn how to teach.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS NOT<br />
IN A DOCTRINAL WAY BUT IN A LIVING WAY</h2>
<p>Suppose a new one who has been reading John 8 comes in to your group meeting. As a new one, he may have a number of questions to ask concerning matters that he does not understand, especially from verses 12-36. Verse 12 begins this section with &ldquo;I am the light of the world,&rdquo; and verse 36 ends the section with &ldquo;If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.&rdquo; In this portion of twenty-five verses the new one may have questions concerning a number of matters. First, he may not understand the Lord&rsquo;s word in verse 24: &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.&rdquo; What does &ldquo;I am&rdquo; refer to? Then, he may not know what the light of life is in verse 12. He may also wonder what the truth is and how the truth can set us free (v. 32). Actually, in this portion of the Word the crucial point is that Christ as the great I Am eventually becomes the truth as our reality, and this is the very factor that sets us free from the slavery of sin. How could the great I Am become such a reality to us? In addition to the I Am and the reality, in verse 12 there is the light of life. The light of life is the key by which we can open the door to answer this question. It is the means by which we can have Christ as the great I Am become the reality to us.</p>
<p>We all need to learn how to answer questions like these. First, we need to learn how to interpret the divine title &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; not in a doctrinal way but in a living way. &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; is the meaning of the name Jehovah (Exo. 3:14-15), and Jehovah is the name of God (Gen. 2:7). The name Jehovah actually means &ldquo;to exist.&rdquo; It is similar in meaning to the verb <em>to be</em>. The great I Am is just the verb <em>to be</em>. Nothing is, but He is. I am not, and you are not; we all are not. Only He is. In the entire universe nothing is; everything is not. Only One is; only One exists. Only Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior, exists. He existed in the past, He exists today, and He will exist in the future. Only He is the very &ldquo;is.&rdquo; Therefore, only He is real.</p>
<p>In the whole universe there is only One who is, who exists. Of course, this One is God, but to say that this One is Elohim, God, the faithful, mighty One, is doctrinal. In John 8 the Pharisees asked the Lord Jesus who He was (v. 25). The Lord&rsquo;s response to them was very mysterious. He said to them, &ldquo;Altogether that which I also tell you.&rdquo; The Lord is the I Am, as He told the Pharisees in verse 24. The Lord is; only He is. Thus, He is real; He is true; He is the reality.</p>
<p>In John 8:12-36 we have the great I Am, the light of life, the Son of Man to be lifted up, and the reality. The reality becomes one with the Son because it is the Son who became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Eventually, the Son and the reality are one. Verse 32 says, &ldquo;The truth [reality] shall set you free,&rdquo; and verse 36 says, &ldquo;The Son sets you free.&rdquo; Hence, the Son is the truth, the reality.</p>
<p>How could this One who is, become the reality that sets us free from sin? The key is that He is the light of life (v. 12). He can be the reality that sets us free from sin because He is the light of life. The power of sin is not outside of us; rather, it is inside of us. The slavery of sin is within us; it is not like a chain outside of us. Christ as the great I Am sets us free not outwardly but inwardly from the power of sin. At the time we were saved it might have seemed that some chains fell off from us and we were released from sin temporarily. However, for the long run, every day we are still enslaved to sin, not outside as with chains, but inside with a bondage. A husband may lose his temper toward his wife, and the wife may lose her temper in return toward her husband. After losing their tempers, they both will regret. The cause of their losing their tempers was not a chain that was upon them outwardly but a power, a slavery, in their constitution.</p>
<p>Christ, the great I Am, has become a releasing, setting-free reality to us because He is the life (14:6; 11:25) and He is the light within us. This light is not the outward light; it is clearly mentioned in John 8:12 as the light of life. The light of life is not an outward light but an inward light. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; Christ is life, and He came to give us life. He came that we might have life (10:10). He is also the life-giver (6:63; 1 Cor. 15:45). The very life which is Christ Himself has been given into us, and this life shines and becomes light within us. This light sets us free. Then we have the reality. This is why we must have the instant and constant fellowship with Him, not only every minute but even every second. Every second we need to be one with Him, fellowshipping with Him. Then He as life within us works. When life works, it shines, and when it shines, it sets us free. In such a situation He, the great I Am, becomes the reality to us, and we are set free from the bondage of our temper. The bondage of our temper is not a chain on our shoulders; it is something in our constitution, in our being, in our fallen nature. Nothing outward can set us free from such bondage. Only the inward life which is Christ Himself can set us free from such bondage by working and shining in us.</p>
<p>This life is the life-giving Spirit, and it is even the Triune God (Eph. 4:18). This is why His name is I Am. <em>I Am</em> denotes the ever-existing and self-existing One, who is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In John 8:16 and 29 the Lord said clearly that He was not alone, but the Father was with Him. When the Son and the Father are present, surely the third One, the Spirit, also is present. Thus, together the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the great I Am. They are the verb <em>to be</em>. They are the ever-existing One, the real One, and the true One. Hence, They are the reality. When They live in us, this is life, and this life shines. When it shines, we are released from sin, from darkness, from death, from falsehood, and from the lie (vv. 24, 34, 44). When the Triune God as life works within us and when this life shines, this shining frees us from all these negative things. Then we are no longer slaves of sin, but we are the sons of God. As the sons of God, we can abide in the house of God forever (vv. 35-36).</p>
<p>The key point in John 8 is the inner life working in us. Normally we do not pay much attention to this matter. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me to overcome my temper. Lord, help me to bear my wife&rsquo;s long face.&rdquo; This is usually our way; but this kind of prayer has never been answered. However, when Christ becomes the operating life that lives in us, the living of this life is the shining of the light. This shining sets us free from falsehood, from death, from darkness, and from sin. This is the glorious freedom and the wonderful freedom. This is the freedom from the inner bondage, the inner slavery. In such a freedom we have the reality, and this reality as the great I Am is both the Son of God and the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The Lord as the Son of Man is for His crucifixion (being lifted up&mdash;v. 28). Without being the Son of Man, He could never be crucified, and without being crucified, He could never accomplish the redemption from sin for us.</p>
<p>The Lord as the Son of God is for His resurrection. Without resurrection, He could never become the life-giving Spirit. It was through resurrection that He became the life-giving Spirit, who is life itself (Rom. 8:2). Today He dwells in us in resurrection as this life-giving Spirit, as this life. This life works and shines, and this life saves us and sets us free from the power, the slavery, of sin by its shining. Thus we have the great I Am, who is the Triune God as our reality that sets us free from sin. This is a proper answer to the question of how Christ as the great I Am could become the reality to us and set us free from the bondage of sin.</p>
<p>In speaking concerning Christ as the great I Am becoming the reality that sets us free, we need to stress the matter of shining. Life alone without shining does not work. Life works through shining. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 3 says that all things came into being through the Word. Then verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; When the life becomes the light, the life works, and that working is just the shining. Verse 4 of chapter one is a controlling verse that controls the entire twenty-one chapters of John. In this One who is the Word, in this One who is with God, in this One who is God, in this One through whom all things came into being, in Him was life, and the life was the light of men. When the life shines, the life works.</p>
<p>We may feel that learning to teach in this way is too difficult. However, let me assure you that it is not difficult. As a young child is learning mathematics, every lesson may seem difficult, but after he completes the lessons, they seem very easy. We all have been led by Christianity to believe that we are not qualified to do anything for the Lord. We have been told that only the Pope or the pastor is qualified to do something for the Lord. However, we must change our concept. We must believe that we can speak for the Lord. Otherwise, we have no way to go on.</p>
<p>In 1934 Brother Nee began to see the light in 1 Corinthians 14. He told us that he saw the light, but there was no way to practice it. That was true because we were too much under the covering of Christianity. Christianity had convinced the saints and subdued them to the uttermost, causing them to believe that they could do nothing. When we were raised up by the Lord in China, we spoke concerning the light that Brother Nee had received from 1 Corinthians 14, but people argued with us, saying that they were not qualified like the apostle Paul. At that time Brother Nee waged a lonely battle in China.</p>
<p>We should not believe that we are incapable of speaking for the Lord. We all have the divine life. Within every life there is a capacity. Even the life of a mosquito has its capacity. We have the divine life with the divine capacity. We need to believe in the capacity of that life. We also need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus and fellowship with Him. We need to breathe Him in. Then we will realize the capacity of the divine life. We also need to exercise this capacity without being afraid of making mistakes. One way to learn is to make mistakes. We should always be willing to make mistakes, and we should never believe the negative things. Only Jesus Christ never made a mistake. Paul, Moses, and David all made mistakes. We should abandon fully the influence and the background of Christianity.</p>
<p>We all like to be the best at whatever we do. If we cannot be the best in a certain thing, we will not do it. This kind of attitude is wrong. We should try to do something and not be concerned if we are the worst one. After a period of time we may improve and become one of the best ones.</p>
<p>The best teaching always implies two things: the highest revelation and the rich experience of life. You may give a word perhaps for just two minutes, yet in your word there may be the highest revelation and also the very rich experience of life. This is the best teaching. The speaking of some Christian teachers is full of cleverness, eloquence, and good illustrations, but it is devoid of revelation and lacking in experience of life. We must learn to teach with the highest revelation and the rich experience of life.</p>
<p>The practice of the new way in Russia is very encouraging. The church in St. Petersburg was raised up just a little over six months ago. Recently, they had a general gathering in which the five districts came together, and the number who attended was one thousand one hundred thirty-one. We have received quite a few letters from St. Petersburg saying that although the new ones have been in the church life less than half a year, they can speak as if they had been in the church life for a number of years.</p>
<p>We have been delayed. The enemy, Satan, has been fighting and attacking from the beginning of the recovery in the United States in 1962. From that time the recovery in this country has passed through many troubles. A number of very good brothers came into the recovery and were absolute for a time, but then they changed. If from the beginning all those who came into the recovery in America had remained until today, we would have much more manpower to carry on the work in Russia. However, at the present time we are short of manpower. Some of the manpower in the recovery has been spoiled.</p>
<p>In our group meetings we need to practice teaching by mutual asking and mutual answering. We need to consider how to answer questions on subjects such as God&rsquo;s economy, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, objective justification, reconciliation, subjective sanctification, and the ground of the church. It seems that we understand the doctrines, but when it comes to the matter of teaching, we may think that it is too difficult. However, if we do not do our best to teach, the vital groups will have no way to go on. In the group meetings the main thing is to perfect and equip one another by teaching. If we do not practice the mutual teaching, the group meetings will not be so useful. Sooner or later we must learn to teach in the group meetings. Otherwise, when we come together with the new ones, no one will have anything to ask, and no one will have anything to answer. Since no one will have anything to speak, the group meetings will be of less use. We need to make the group meetings very busy, with much traffic. This depends on our asking and on our answering; it depends on our teaching. If the new ones do not ask anything, we should propose something to ask.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE BREAKING OF THE CROSS<br />
TO DEAL WITH OUR PECULIAR TRAITS</h2>
<p>In the previous message we mentioned the matter of dealing with our disposition, our character, and our peculiar traits. In this message I would like to say a word concerning our peculiar traits. A number of saints among us have strong peculiar traits. To some extent, those traits have spoiled these saints. To deal with our peculiar traits, we all need to receive the breaking of the cross. Brother Nee spoke much concerning character and the breaking of the cross. Peculiar traits are particular characteristics of our character. A good character is one that has no particular traits. Brother Nee said that if a person&rsquo;s peculiar traits could not be broken before he was fifty years old, it would be nearly impossible to break those traits after that.</p>
<p>A peculiar person is always different from others; he is not common. Everyone has some peculiar traits, but some are light, whereas others are very heavy. In our married life the most troublesome thing is our peculiar traits. It is difficult for a person who is strong in peculiar traits to have a good married life, unless his spouse will always give in and allow him to be what he is. Because both spouses have peculiar traits, they must both learn to give in. Whenever we give in to others, our peculiar traits are annulled. However, if we insist on our own way or our habits, we may become more peculiar. How much we can be used by the Lord depends mainly on how much we would receive the breaking of the cross. The breaking of the cross is mainly to break our disposition, character, and peculiar traits. We all excuse ourselves for our peculiar traits, saying that we were born that way. However, we should never say this. We should not make any excuse for our peculiarities. We should not believe that our excuses are right. Actually, no excuse is right.</p>
<p>The practice of praying long prayers may also be a peculiar trait. On one occasion Brother Nee was strong to say that often we pray prayers that are not really prayers. Even in our way of praying, our peculiar traits may be very strong. We should learn to go along with the atmosphere in the church meeting, not insisting on our own way or habit.</p>
<p>The Christian life is a life in which we must always go against ourselves. If we do everything against ourselves, we are right. In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.&rdquo; To deny ourselves is to be against ourselves. Some brothers have the peculiar trait of speaking with many words. They think that the more sentences, phrases, and clauses they speak, the better people will be able to understand them. Eventually, after their speaking, people may not know what they have spoken about.</p>
<p>Some saints are unable to pray without the &ldquo;cane&rdquo; of description or explanation. If we consider Paul&rsquo;s two prayers in Ephesians 1 and 3, we will see that they contained no explanation. In 3:14-17 Paul prayed, &ldquo;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; Paul told the Lord what he wanted, without adding any explanation. A great part of our Christian life and work has been exhausted by our peculiar traits.</p>
<p>We need to prepare ourselves by considering how to teach all the subjects that we have picked up in the recovery. We need to consider how to teach redemption, justification, and reconciliation. If you do not know how to teach these matters, you can look into some of our books in order to prepare yourself. When the groups come together, they should practice this kind of mutual asking, mutual answering, and mutual teaching. We will need this, and we will use this very much.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PAYING THE PRICE TO LEARN THE DIVINE TRUTHS AND PRACTICE THE MUTUAL TEACHING<br />
IN THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the matter of mutual teaching in the vital groups. To speak in a natural way, to gossip, to murmur, and to complain are all quite easy, but to teach the divine truths is not easy. In the vital groups we need to reach the goal of carrying out the mutual teaching through mutual asking and mutual answering. The vital groups must be the teaching organ in the church life. We all need to be willing to pay the price to reach this goal.</p>
<p>The vital groups can be eighty percent of the church life mainly due to the mutual teaching. Of the eighty percent, sixty percent depends on the mutual perfecting by the mutual teaching. Thus far, we are still in the initial stage.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF ALL THE SAINTS<br />
TO LEARN THE BIBLICAL TRUTHS</h2>
<p>More than fifty years ago Brother Nee saw the light in 1 Corinthians 14 concerning all the believers prophesying in the church meetings (vv. 24, 31). Brother Nee published two books&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> (first published in Chinese in 1939 under the title <em>Concerning Our Missions</em>) and <em>Church Affairs</em> (messages given by Brother Nee in 1948)&mdash;in which he spoke of this matter. In both books he stressed that the practice of one man speaking in the church meetings must be put down. In <em>Church Affairs</em> (page 81) Brother Nee said that all the saints need to continually &ldquo;push against&rdquo; the tradition of having a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting in which one man speaks and all the rest listen. Eventually, he said, that tradition would be overthrown. Today, forty-four years later, we have still not fully eliminated that practice. Today as we are practicing the prophesying according to 1 Corinthians 14, the temptation may still rise up within us to return to the practice of one man speaking.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Second World War in 1945, very few renowned speakers have been raised up in Christianity, especially in the United States. Over this period of time, the attempts of a few spiritual men to bring in a spiritual revival in America have not been successful. Even though I am very much for the increase in the churches, I would not place much confidence in well-known speakers and big works. In a certain sense, whether the number of saints in the churches of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is large or small is not very significant. What matters today is that all the saints need to get into the truths of the Bible. This is very difficult; it is not an easy way. In Matthew 7:14 the Lord Jesus told us that the way that leads to life is a constricted way and that not many would find this way and walk in this way. This being the case, we may all be tempted to give up. We may give up, but Someone within us would not give up. The fact that few will enter through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way does not mean that the Lord Jesus will suffer a defeat. On the contrary, He will still succeed. The Lord expects to have a bride, and He will have His bride. Revelation 19:7 says that the day will come when the bride will be ready. Will we be included? To this question we should respond, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; To say &ldquo;I will&rdquo; means that we are still endeavoring. We have not yet arrived, but we are still endeavoring to arrive.</p>
<p>If we mean business with the Lord to participate in the vital groups, from this point forward we must make up our mind with a definite determination that we will endeavor to get into the biblical truths. How we need to thank the Lord that today we have a Bible that has been not only translated but also interpreted. What we have is not perfect, complete, or fully consummated; nevertheless, what we have in the recovery today is vastly different from what I had as a young man. In my youth I tried my best to collect books that would help me to know Genesis, but I was not able to find many helpful books. However, today, if you desire to know Genesis, there is a book called <em>Life-study of Genesis</em> that contains one hundred twenty messages on Genesis. If you read several messages a day in a quick way, without musing on what you read, you should be able to finish this book in approximately one month. I believe that it is possible for nearly all the saints, young and old, to do this. After you read <em>Life-study of Genesis</em> once, your understanding will be different. Reading the one hundred twenty messages on Genesis will make you different.</p><h2 class="head1">CEASING ALL OUR UNNECESSARY TALK</h2>
<p>When you decide to do this kind of reading, you must also decide to cease all your unnecessary talk, your murmuring, your complaining, and your gossiping (Matt. 12:36; Eph. 4:29). When you answer the telephone, you should learn to keep your conversations to as few sentences as possible. In Jeremiah 15:19 Jehovah told Jeremiah, &ldquo;If you bring out the precious from the worthless, / You will be as My mouth.&rdquo; At that time Jeremiah was disappointed, and he complained to his mother and then to Jehovah (vv. 10, 18). It was then that Jehovah told Jeremiah, in reference to his speaking, to bring out the precious from the worthless. In Zephaniah 3:9 in His salvation to the Gentiles Jehovah promised to &ldquo;change the language of the peoples / Into a pure language.&rdquo; This indicates that all God&rsquo;s people need to have their language changed into a pure language. According to my experience, if we talk too much, our talk will annul our capacity to teach. If we will reduce our talk, our capacity to teach will be increased. If we would carry out the mutual teaching in the vital groups, we must terminate our idle talk and concentrate our entire being on one thing: learning the truth so that we will be furnished, equipped, and completed to have the capacity and also the capability to teach.</p>
<p>It is true that capacity comes by birth, but we all need to realize that we have had a second birth, and our second birth is still in the process of the delivery. Although you might have been regenerated many years ago, you need to realize that you have not come out of the womb yet; you are still in the &ldquo;womb&rdquo; of the Holy Spirit. This is why we need to be renewed (Eph. 4:23; Titus 3:5). Renewing is the continuation of our second birth. The result of being renewed is transformation (Rom 12:2). Transformation is the continuation of regeneration. We need to be transformed because we were not thoroughly and completely regenerated. Our regeneration is not entirely thorough. If our regeneration had been thorough, we would not need transformation. Transformation is the continuation of our incomplete regeneration. The more we terminate our unnecessary talking, the more we are reborn, and the more capacity we will have for the learning and teaching of the truths of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING ONLY WHAT IS WORTHWHILE</h2>
<p>We must also learn not to speak any sentence that is not worthwhile. We need to restrict our speaking, especially toward our children and our spouse. Then we will realize that every day the Lord is building us up in one thing, that is, to speak for Him. If you will practice my fellowship for six months, your capacity to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, will be increased.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN AN &ldquo;OFFICIAL&rdquo; WAY</h2>
<p>We also need to learn to speak in the &ldquo;official&rdquo; way. We need to learn to speak loudly, slowly, clearly, and &ldquo;officially,&rdquo; in a weighty way that imparts some definite points of the truth to others. Otherwise, our speaking will not convey anything definite to the hearers.</p>
<p>Whether we are old or young, we should not consider the meetings as a small thing. The meetings are not a small thing. They are gatherings in the Lord, with the Lord, and before the Lord. Hence, whatever we do, we must do it full of reverence, with a holy fear. In the meetings whatever we speak, whether in prayer, in calling a hymn, in offering praise, or in prophesying, we must do it &ldquo;officially&rdquo;; that is, we must speak loudly, properly, and slowly so that everyone can hear and everyone will listen and receive something. Otherwise, we will become a burden and a deadening factor to the meetings. To speak something in the meetings is absolutely different from speaking in any other kind of environment or circumstance. In the meetings our speaking is before God; thus, it is holy.</p>
<p>Too often our speaking is full of wasted words. In contrast, the speaking of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels was brief, fitting, purified, clean, and without wasted words. When we stand up in the meetings to speak for the Lord, we must have the assurance that what we are going to speak is something with weight, with light, and with the life supply. Furthermore, we must learn to speak in an &ldquo;official&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>First, you need to make a decision to read the Life-study Messages in order to learn the truth. I strongly recommend that all the saints read quickly through the Life-studies on Genesis and the fourteen Epistles of Paul. After reading those messages, you will be different. Second, you need to stop all your unnecessary talk. Under the Lord&rsquo;s inner restricting, you should learn not to speak unnecessarily to anyone, but just to talk to the Lord. Often I have the desire to speak to my wife concerning a certain matter. However, many times the inward prohibition is there, telling me that I do not need to speak to my wife concerning that matter. Sometimes I disregard that prohibition, and afterward I regret and confess to the Lord, asking Him to forgive me for speaking something that is unnecessary. We may not say anything sinful, and we may not criticize anyone; we may want only to relate some information to people. However, often the Lord will inwardly prohibit us from doing this. If we will go along with the Lord and cut off our unnecessary talk, the Lord will use our mouth to speak His word. Our mouth will be sanctified for the speaking of the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Third, whether we speak to our spouse, to our children, or to the brothers, we need to learn to speak only what is worthwhile. Fourth, we need to learn to be &ldquo;official&rdquo;; that is, we should learn not to speak lightly, but carefully, speaking every word in an &ldquo;official&rdquo; way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE RECOVERY TODAY&mdash;<br />
TO GAIN THE INCREASE</h2>
<p>In the near future we will train the vital group members to go out to contact people with the gospel. I do believe that we will gain some people. So, immediately we will all need to know how to nourish the newborn spiritual babes that they may be kept and preserved. After a short time, we will all need to bring these babes into our vital groups to perfect them through mutual teaching.</p>
<p>Although in the past we have baptized many people, our rate of increase has been very low. In the past eighteen years, since 1974, the number of local churches has increased substantially. At the present time there may be more than twelve hundred local churches on the earth outside of mainland China. However, the number of members in many of the churches is quite small. In Southern California there are now forty-nine churches, and the total number of saints is approximately three thousand. This means that on the average, each church has only sixty members. In spite of the increase in the number of churches, our rate of increase still has not been satisfactory. Therefore, we must find a way to change our present situation.</p>
<p>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the greatest need, the primary need, is to gain the increase. A house cannot be built without materials. We need to save sinners through the preaching of the gospel that they may become material for the building up of the church as the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15). In general, the rate of increase depends on the way we labor in the gospel, and also on the environment and the people. In Russia, in a short time of approximately one year, two large churches have been raised up, one in Moscow and another in St. Petersburg. There the rate of increase has been very high because the way has been somewhat right, the environment is very favorable, and the people are very suitable. For a number of reasons the rate of increase in the United States has been much lower. The rate of increase among the churches in Taiwan has been similar to that in the United States. The churches in Taiwan have been in existence for more than forty years, yet the number of saints in the churches today indicates that the rate of increase has been lower than ten percent per year.</p>
<p>If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we need to consider our present situation seriously. We should not be comfortable concerning the present situation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, especially regarding the matter of increase. With the exception of Russia, the situation everywhere&mdash;in America, in Europe, and in the Far East&mdash;is about the same with regard to the increase. We need to be aware of the present situation. We should not allow ourselves to be drugged, thinking that the situation among us is so wonderful. No doubt the recovery is wonderful, but some aspects of the recovery are not encouraging, especially the matter of increase. This is why in 1984 I went to Taiwan purposely to study this matter.</p>
<p>I feel that in order for us to be rescued from our present situation, we definitely need the vital groups. The vital groups are a matter of life or death. From now on, none of us should act, move, or do anything in the meetings lightly. When we speak, we must say something that is worthwhile, and we should say it &ldquo;officially.&rdquo; Otherwise, we should remain silent. Even when we are sitting still and are silent, we should do so in a stately manner, not in a light way. If we do things lightly, how could we have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing? We need to bring this matter to the Lord and pray. The recovery is not only yours or mine; it is ours. Therefore, we all should consider it seriously as a matter of life or death.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VISION NEEDED<br />
TO CARRY OUT THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<p>Before we start to move, start to work, start to take action, in the preaching of the gospel, I have a heavy burden with a heavy word to fellowship with you all.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why we use the term <em>vital groups</em>. This is a special term. The reason that we need to have this kind of training with these groups is that for centuries the Lord&rsquo;s church on this earth has become degraded. Then the Lord raised up the recovery. To go down is easy. To go up is not so easy. Even to stand where you are and where you should be is also quite hard. The recovery has been with us for seventy years, but regretfully we have been gradually going down and down to a situation that cannot be considered normal. Rather, it has become abnormal.</p>
<p>When I made the decision to return to Taiwan in 1984, I realized that our rate of increase in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had become quite low. The real situation in the recovery on the earth by that time was not fully exposed to me. Eventually, my going to Taiwan to carry out the God-ordained way to build up the church stirred up much opposition. Ambition became prevailing among certain ones. These ones had a real conspiracy with a plan concerning how to take over the recovery. The speaking of these rebellious ones devastated the truth.</p>
<p>Because of this background, I have a real burden to carry out this training for the vital groups. Besides the full-time training, we need this training. The full-time training is our common church training, but this training for the vital groups is very special. This training is for the rescue of the recovery from degradation.</p>
<p>We need to see that the degradation of Christianity is completely and absolutely due to the absence, the shortage, of the divine revelation. Proverbs 29:18 says that without a vision, the people run wild. This verse can be applied to today&rsquo;s Christianity. Church history shows us that many of those in Christianity are wild, without restriction and without control. The situation in Christianity may be likened to the period of time spoken of in the book of Judges. Judges tells us that during that time every man did what was right in his own eyes (21:25). We need to be rescued from this situation of degradation.</p>
<p>In this message I would like to speak a brief and clear word to you all, hoping that this could be a real vision to you. What I want to share with you is the extract, the very essence, of all the messages given in Atlanta in the Thanksgiving Day conference of 1992. The title of these messages was <em>The Constitution and the Building Up of the Body of Christ.</em> Then I want to share the extract of the two messages given to the elders after the winter training of 1992 on the book of Job. These two messages were entitled <em>The Ministry of the New Testament</em> and <em>The Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles</em>.</p>
<p>In the Thanksgiving Day conference I gave six messages concerning the Body of Christ. These six messages cover four points: the constitution of the Body of Christ, the growth of Christ in His Body so that the Body can grow, the transformation of the saints in the Body of Christ, and the building up of the Body of Christ. Constitution, growth, transformation, and building up are all either by life or with life. The messages I gave to the elders after the winter training of 1992 cover three more crucial points: the ministry of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles. We all need to see a vision of these seven points.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUTION OF<br />
THE BODY OF CHRIST WITH LIFE</h2>
<p>The constitution of the Body of Christ is with life. The Body of Christ as the church has been constituted not with by-laws or by a charter, but with Christ Himself as the element of life. The Triune God in eternity came in incarnation to become a sower to sow Himself as the seed into the human heart (Matt. 13:3, 19-23). This shows the way that the Body of Christ was brought forth or how the Body of Christ was produced. It was produced by a kind of constitution with Christ Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God to be the life seed sown into our being. Then we all became the many grains of this unique seed (John 12:24).</p>
<p>The one grain sown into us eventually became many grains, and the many grains are the components of the Body of Christ but not the constitution. We are only the components, but Christ Himself as life is the constitution. The Body of Christ is composed of the believers, but it is constituted with Christ as the element of life. Not many Christians see or know what the constitution and the composition of the Body of Christ are. The very church in the eyes of today&rsquo;s Christians and in the speaking of today&rsquo;s Christian teachers is merely a kind of composition of believers. They have not seen that the Body of Christ is a real constitution.</p>
<p>Our human body is a picture of the Body of Christ. Our body is not just a composition but a constitution. A wooden stand is a mere composition because it is lifeless, inorganic. But because our physical body is organic, it is a constitution of an inner life. If the inner life is taken away, the components of our body will become a heap of collapse. With the life, our body becomes a constitution. The Body of Christ is just like this.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is not merely a composition of believers of many nationalities. We all have been born into the Body of Christ. Our stomach and our two eyes were born into our body. They were organically constituted into our body. In like manner, we were born, organically constituted, into the Body of Christ. I do not consider each of you as being composed into an organization. Rather I consider each one of you as a living, organic member constituted into the Body of Christ through your regeneration with the very Christ whom you received into you and into whom you believed. The constitution of the Body of Christ is with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element. Today you are not in an organization as a composition; you are in an organism as a constitution. This organism is constituted not just according to the truth but with the very Christ as the all-inclusive life element.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>This Christ, who is the life element with which His Body is constituted, has been sown into us, making our heart the growing earth, the growing soil. In this soil this Christ, who is the element of life to His Body, is growing. We are used to saying that we are growing. Actually, however, He is growing. When He grows in us, we grow. We grow by His growth. Colossians 2:19 reveals that we grow by the growth of God within us. We do have a living One within us who is taking our heart as His soil and growing there. By His growth we grow. This is the growth of Christ within His Body, within the very heart of the believers who are the members of His Body.</p>
<p>In the book entitled <em>The Constitution and the Building Up of the Body of Christ,</em> we saw the building up of the Body of Christ by the growth in life in the writings of John, Peter, and Paul. These three leading writers of the New Testament all touched the matter of the growth in life. This growth has a base, a way, and a goal. Our being in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not just a matter of learning the recovery truths but a matter of giving the indwelling Christ within us a chance to grow. The Lord made this very clear to us in Matthew 13. In order for Christ as the life element to grow within us, we must deal with our heart, the soil. We must deal with the human heart as the wayside, with the shallow heart with the hidden rocks, and with the heart with the thorns, signifying the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches. By His grace we must deal with our heart to keep our heart pure for Him to grow in us. The constitution of the Body of Christ is with life, and the building up of the Body of Christ is by the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFORMATION BY LIFE</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is also by the transformation of the members of the Body of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2a). Transformation is not an outward change by self-improvement. We need to realize the difference between outward improvement and real transformation. Transformation is not an outward change, improvement, or advance. Transformation is a metabolic transaction within us. Through metabolism a new element is added to our being to discharge and replace the old element. Transformation does not mean that someone who is a quick person becomes a slow person. This may be a mere outward change and improvement. Transformation means that we receive more element of Christ into us while He is growing within us to replace all of our old things such as our old life, old nature, old disposition, old character, and old habit. We need a replacement not an outward change. This replacement is the living Christ, the indwelling Christ. Day after day as we love Him more and give Him more ground within us, He is adding Himself into us and growing within us to be the replacing element. He replaces our old creation. This is the real significance of transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP BY LIFE</h2>
<p>When we have the constitution with life, the growth of Christ in life, and the transformation by life, we are ready to be built up. We need to be constituted with life, growing in life, transformed by life, and built up by life. Everything related to the Body of Christ is with life, in life, and by life. Who is the life? The life is the all-inclusive Christ, who is the processed and consummated Triune God (John 14:6a). This processed and consummated Triune God is the constituting life, the growing life, and the transforming life to us. Then this life becomes the very factor of the building up of the Body of Christ within us and among us.</p>
<p>We need to remember these four things: constitution, growth, transformation, and building up. I hope we all can see that the Body of Christ is constituted with Christ as the life element. Then this Christ grows in His Body to add Himself more and more into us that we may have the growth in life. Then with the same life we are being transformed. Our old creation is being replaced by Christ Himself as the element and factor of the new creation. Then we are qualified and are on the proper level to be built up by the same life. This life is the Triune God embodied in Christ. We all have to see this. This revelation will revolutionize our being and will change our Christian being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The last three points we need to see are the ministry of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles. When we speak of the one ministry, we mean the New Testament ministry that builds up the Body of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul said that we, the many, have received this ministry. Then Ephesians 4:12 says that the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers perfect the many saints to do the work of the ministry. The ministry is singular, and the work is also singular. There is only one work on the whole earth. From the day of Pentecost, the Lord began only one work by one ministry, but this work has been carried out by thousands of workers, and this ministry has been carried out by thousands of ministers.</p>
<p>If you read 2 Corinthians 3 and 4, you can see the ministers (plural) and the ministry (singular). The New Testament ministers (3:6) all have a part in the one New Testament ministry (4:1). Peter&rsquo;s ministry was a part of the ministry; Paul&rsquo;s ministry was a part of the ministry; John&rsquo;s ministry was a part of the ministry; and Timothy&rsquo;s ministry was a part of the ministry (2 Tim. 4:5). When I came to this country and used the term <em>the ministry,</em> I meant the unique New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ. I did not mean that this was only my ministry. I hope that we all can see this.</p>
<p>In 1969 a brother who used to be among us said that we received only one man&rsquo;s ministry, whereas he desired to receive all ministries. Actually, however, even though he said that he received all ministries, he at least did not receive my ministry. When I told him this, he said that he received all ministries selectively. But his use of the word <em>selectively</em> meant that he did not receive all ministries. Actually, all the proper ministries of all the proper ministers are the one ministry, which is the unique New Testament ministry (2 Cor. 4:1; Eph. 4:12).</p>
<p>When the Lord brought me into His recovery, from the first day my eyes were opened. I saw that what Brother Nee was ministering was in the line of the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s eternal plan. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is His economy, His eternal arrangement, His plan of the ages. Brother Nee was in the line of the eternal plan of God concerning Christ and concerning the church in life with the Spirit. My eyes were opened to see that this is the real ministry of the New Testament. It is not just to teach typology or prophecy but to teach concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy so that the Body of Christ can be built up. This teaching is called the teaching of the apostles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Some have wrongly said that the teaching of the apostles is only those teachings which the twelve apostles learned of Jesus and passed on to the believers. The Lord surely taught His disciples much in the Gospels, especially in Matthew and John. But in John 16 the Lord told them that He had many things to tell them which they could not bear at that time. He could not release these things until the Spirit of reality would come and unveil all these things to them (vv. 12-13). That meant that after the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the Spirit of reality would come to the apostles and unveil more to them.</p>
<p>The main apostle to whom the Spirit revealed more was the apostle Paul. So Paul said in Colossians 1:25 that he was charged to complete the word of God. The word of God here is concerning the mystery (v. 26), which is Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Without Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles, the holy word concerning the divine revelation of this mystery could never have been completed.</p>
<p>The Spirit of reality also revealed more things to the apostle John in the book of Revelation. Who could write a book like Revelation with the seven lampstands, seven Spirits, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls? It was written by the Lord Jesus as the Spirit through His disciple John. John received the revelation of the mystery of Christ in his spirit (Rev. 1:10). Thus, John said that after the book of Revelation, no one can add anything or subtract anything (22:18-19). From Matthew to Revelation is the entire teaching of the New Testament as the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>At Paul&rsquo;s time some people were teaching the Old Testament genealogies and the law. Others were teaching Gnosticism and asceticism. These different teachings surely were not the ministry. All the works (the ministries) of teachings other than the teaching of the apostles for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are not counted in the unique ministry of the New Testament (1 Tim. 1:3-4). The so-called ministries are the factors for so many denominations today. The teaching of baptism by immersion resulted in the Baptist denomination. The teaching concerning the management of the church by the presbytery, a body of elders, issued in the establishment of the Presbyterian denomination. All denominations have their own ministries. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not have many different ministries; we have only one ministry. If we received all the so-called ministries as the ministries of the denominations, we would have to receive the ministries of the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Methodists, the Episcopalians, etc. These different ministries and teachings issue in divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>In the New Testament there is only one ministry with one kind of teaching and one fellowship. The early believers continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the apostles&rsquo; fellowship (Acts 2:42). This fellowship of the divine life is between the apostles and the believers (1 John 1:1-3a), between the apostles and the Triune God (1 John 1:3b), and also among all the believers (1 John 1:2-3, 7). This fellowship is not like that of a school fraternity. The students in a school may have their fraternity, but this fraternity does not have the flow of the divine life, the growth of the divine life, and the produce of the divine life. The divine fellowship is flowing, growing, and reproducing. It is the issue of the eternal life and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in all the believers (2 Cor. 13:14), and the fellowship of the Body of Christ in the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3-4a).</p>
<p>We need to pay our full attention to the seven items we have mentioned above: constitution, growth, transformation, building up plus one ministry, one teaching, and one fellowship. If all the Christians would stick themselves to these seven things, who could make a division? As the members of the vital groups, we must be clear about this. If we are not clear about this, we are not qualified to be members of the vital groups. We may be in a certain group, but that group may not be vital.</p>
<p>When I came into the recovery, I made a strong determination to pick up the ministry for the building up of the Body, that is, the ministry in the line of God&rsquo;s eternal plan with life by the Spirit. For sixty-one years I have not changed. I have been absolutely one with the ministry.</p>
<p>Since we all have seen this, we must be persons who live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, and do everything in the Spirit. How can we be victorious? How can we be overcoming? We must live, walk, and do things in the Spirit. How can we be holy? We must live, walk, and do things in the Spirit. How can we be spiritual? We must live, walk, and do things in the Spirit. Whatever we are going to do, we should not do it until we realize that we are in the Spirit. We should not talk until we can say, &ldquo;Yes, I am in the Spirit.&rdquo; Degraded Christianity makes things so complicated, but actually the Christian life, the church life, is the simplest life. It is a life in the Spirit. We must stand fast in the divine revelation and practice this one point of the Christian life, that is, to live, to walk, and to do everything in the Spirit.</p>
<p>If we are such people, we are ready to move with the Lord. We have to realize that we, the members of Christ, are the New Testament priests of the gospel. The first thing the priests should do is to offer the sacrifices to God. Today in the New Testament, our sacrifices are not cattle, are not sheep and oxen. Our sacrifices are the saved sinners becoming the members of Christ (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). We are offering them as members of the Body of Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes, they are the living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). This is the first thing we have to do.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO CONTACT AND GAIN PEOPLE</h1>
<p>In this message I would like to coach you in how to contact people and gain people for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO DISCERN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>We are contacting people all the time. We are in contact with our relatives, our neighbors, our classmates, and our colleagues. The first thing we have to learn in our contact with people is how to discern them, to know them. We have to discern what kind of character and disposition they have. We also should know their mood and temperament at the time we are speaking to them. We need to discern whether they are happy or mad. Sometimes people will try to hide their temperament when they talk to you. If a person is too mad or too excited, it will be difficult to talk to him. This is why we need to discern a person&rsquo;s situation when we talk with him.</p>
<p>We may realize that certain persons are too proud, too much in their mind, too philosophical, or too emotional. We may realize that others have a strong will and that whatever they think cannot be changed. Whatever they say must be followed. Our proper discernment of people will help us to reach them and have the proper contact with them. We should not let people know that we are discerning them, measuring them, and testing them. We should simply be with them in a normal way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT CORRECTING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Although we may know someone&rsquo;s character, disposition, and situation, we should never try to correct him. If you find out a certain person is emotional with a bad temper, you should be very careful not to touch his temper. If you touch his temper, you are wrong. Always say something, do something, and express something to others in a very natural way, without trying to correct them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING PEOPLE<br />
IN THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>In addition to this, we have to learn how to trust the Lord at the very juncture we are speaking to people. We should pray inwardly, &ldquo;Lord, here is this person. Lord, what should I do?&rdquo; While we are praying inwardly, we should simply follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to speak something in a very natural way.</p>
<p>This kind of contact with people is altogether in the principle of incarnation. Incarnation is a matter of two natures&mdash;the divine nature and the human nature. Incarnation means that these two natures come together and are mingled together. When we contact people, we must practice the principle of incarnation.</p>
<p>The principle of the apostles&rsquo; writing of their Epistles was altogether in the principle of incarnation. Romans was written in this way. No doubt, that was a human writing. But this writing was not purely or merely of the man, Paul. Paul was writing with the Spirit. In his Epistles, Paul told us that he was the one writing to the saints. He did not say, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord....&rdquo; This is the thinking of the Pentecostal movement according to the Old Testament way. This is not according to the New Testament principle of incarnation, which we all must practice.</p>
<p>This is why we need much preparation to make ourselves one with the indwelling Triune God. Wherever we are and wherever we go, we should be able to say that we are one with God. Whenever we speak, we should speak in the principle of incarnation. We should not speak to others by ourselves, but we should speak together with our indwelling Lord. It is our speaking, yet the Lord speaks. This is according to what the apostle Paul expressed in 1 Corinthians 7. He gave his opinion (vv. 10, 12, 40), even though he said he did not have the Lord&rsquo;s commandment (v. 25). Then eventually he said, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (v. 40). This shows that he and God the Spirit spoke together. We should always practice this principle.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet (Jer. 1:2; Ezek. 1:3), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus the two speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. This is the principle of incarnation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF HOW TO CONTACT PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Now I would like to mention a few practical points. In contacting people, we should not start our conversation in a particular way. Rather, we should speak in a very common way. Out of our common talk, we can speak something of the Lord to them.</p>
<p>One brother told us that he contacted a person on his job who was a young engineer. He read some notes to this young man out of the Recovery Version concerning the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1. He was hoping that this young man would be attracted by the truth in Matthew 1. But when that young man realized that this brother was meeting in a local church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, he became critical. Also this brother has a neighbor who is a pastor. This pastor also became critical when he found out where this brother was meeting. When you come across rejecting and criticizing cases like these, you should not be disappointed. There are many cases like these.</p>
<p>You have to exercise your patience. You should not argue with others. When someone says something in a negative and contending way, it is best to try to turn the subject to something else in order to calm him down and maintain your friendship with him. You need to look to the Lord for the appropriate time to speak to him about his concerns or misconceptions. The next time you spend with him may be the right time. Of course, before that time, you should pray much. You should pray for the right time to be able to speak to people. Then you can open the talk with them naturally.</p>
<p>If the Lord would arrange for you to have another time with this young engineer, you could change the subject from the genealogy of Christ to the book of Philippians. This young man is a Christian, and he knows today&rsquo;s situation among the Christians. He is surely seeking after the Lord. Otherwise, he would not be concerned about your situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. With such a person, you can share Philippians 1:19. This verse is a very sweet word concerning the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is a pleasant subject and a sweet item. You should not talk with him about the genealogy of Christ. Instead, you should just speak to him about the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>After another period of time you can share Philippians 1:21a with him. Here Paul said, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; Paul lived Christ so that he could magnify Christ, whether through life or through death (v. 20). This is another sweet word. If you can speak to him every two or three days and show him many pleasant things from the Scriptures, that young man&rsquo;s heart will be touched and moved.</p>
<p>Through your prayer and speaking, you will win his trust and he might eventually express his concerns to you again about the false rumors he has heard about us. You must learn to be wise. You should not respond by merely saying that these things are false and nonsensical. You could say, &ldquo;We all know the principle of cause and effect. If there is an effect, there must be some cause. I have been listening to the ministry in the local churches for a long time, and you know that I am not foolish. How could the Lord gain such a result among us with such a rich deposit of the truth? What is the cause?&rdquo; You should not say anything else to him after this. He might want you to share more with him, but you should wait for another time to speak more. We should not be in a hurry. We should not think that we have to finish our talk to gain a person in one day. A good fisher is always very steady. If a fisherman acts too quickly, he will drive the fish away from him. A good fisherman knows that the more the fish bites at the bait, the more it gets caught.</p>
<p>At another time you may be able to say more. You may say, &ldquo;In the past month, I shared with you concerning the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and concerning our living Christ that we might magnify Christ through life or through death. I was a Christian for years and I never heard these truths. I did not realize that these things were in the Bible. The more I listened to the ministry in the church, the more truths in the Bible I discovered. Hundreds of people have had the same experience as I have had.&rdquo; This is the way to erase the doubts in his mind from the false rumors he has heard.</p>
<p>In principle you should deal in the same way with the pastor. He may ask you if you have a pastor. You may respond by saying that you have many pastors and that you also are a pastor. You may say, &ldquo;I am working at a job, but I am also a pastor without receiving any pay for it.&rdquo; Then you may proceed to tell him about the particular new ones or saints whom you have pastored. He may go on to ask how your church is organized and how you raise funds for your church and your work. You should always exercise to answer him in an interesting way. Do not be too quick to get people.</p>
<p>Eventually he might ask you if he can come to a meeting, but you should not respond to this until you feel that the time is ripe for him to come. When you realize that the time is ripe, you may tell him, &ldquo;Now I will bring you to my meeting, but you have to do me a favor first. Bring me to your church to see your meeting first.&rdquo; It would be best if you could go to his meeting place two or three times before bringing him to our meeting. Then you can see their practices. This will prepare you to bring him to our meeting. Then you will know how to share with him and direct him to see some things, and he can have a comparison. Such a comparison will be helpful to him. These are illustrations of how we can care for people in ministering Christ to them. We need to apply the principle of incarnation with all the people we contact.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING OFF OUR DEBT OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>As the members of the vital groups, we need to pay off our debt of the gospel (Rom. 1:14-15) to our relatives, who are our first inner circle, our closest circle of contacts. Many of our relatives are still not saved. We have to pray for them. Starting from today, the Lord may lead you to pray for them for six months. You do not need to pray too long. Every day after rising up, you may say, &ldquo;Lord, my mother is still not saved.&rdquo; This is your prayer. After work in the afternoon, when you get in the car, you may say, &ldquo;Lord, my mother is still not saved.&rdquo; Cry to the Lord in this way for half a year, and see what will come out.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, George M&#252;ller told us that he prayed for hundreds of people. Sooner or later all of these people were saved. He prayed for one person on his list for a long time, and that man was eventually saved after George M&#252;ller died. We have to believe that our concern for sinners is of the Lord. He chose and predestinated people, and now our prayer is required for their salvation. Thousands of people in our localities were chosen and predestinated by our Father God, but without any prayer, without any concern by God&rsquo;s children for His chosen ones, He will not save anyone. He cannot save anyone until we pray. In principle all of us have been saved through someone&rsquo;s prayer. I was saved through my sister&rsquo;s prayer. We all need to pray for our relatives continually until they all are saved.</p>
<p>We do not need to pray long prayers. A number of us have a habit of praying long prayers with long sentences. Much of what we pray in this way is full of wasted words. The Lord desires to hear our genuine prayer, without our explanations and teachings. We should cry to the Lord in a simple and direct way for the salvation of all our relatives, one by one. This is the way to clear up our debt of the gospel with our relatives, our first circle of responsibility. Our neighbors should be considered as our second circle, and our classmates and colleagues as our third circle. The Lord told His disciples that they would be His witnesses in Jerusalem (the inner circle), in Judea (the second circle), in Samaria (the third circle), and to the uttermost parts of the earth (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>This does not mean that while we are clearing up our debt of the gospel with our relatives, we do not need to contact anyone else. As we are laboring with the Lord in the gospel, He will sovereignly give us people. We should not forget the case in Acts 8 of Philip with the eunuch from Ethiopia. This eunuch was returning to his own country from his worship to God at Jerusalem, and he was reading the book of Isaiah. The Spirit led Philip to this eunuch for his salvation. That eunuch was not someone intimately related to Philip. If we are persons loving the Lord and willing to sacrifice everything for others&rsquo; salvation, the Lord will sovereignly bring us to those whom He has chosen and predestinated.</p>
<p>The Lord is hunting for those who will be His lovers. In order to be vital members of the vital groups, we must be lovers of the Lord. In our hearts the Lord should have the first place, the preeminence. We need to be those who live Him and who live to Him. If we are such persons, would not the Lord use us? Surely He would use us. Every day He would use us to contact people. As lovers of the Lord we will spontaneously be concerned for others&rsquo; salvation.</p>
<p>We all need to be burdened to pay off our debt. Paul said in Romans 1 that he was a debtor to those who had not heard the gospel from him (vv. 14-15). Paul was endeavoring to pay his debt of the gospel. He said that he owed people the gospel. We all owe our parents, relatives, cousins, in-laws, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues. We owe the gospel to every man.</p>
<p>We could tell someone that we owe him something. When he asks us what we owe him, we can say, &ldquo;I owe you Christ.&rdquo; Then we can speak about Christ to him. If we are persons who love the Lord and who are endeavoring to pay off our debt of the gospel, the Lord will use us to bring people to Himself. We have not yet become &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; to such an extent. I was saved through someone who was &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in this way, who loved the Lord to the uttermost. She was a young sister who was six years older than I. We must remember that the people whom we beget will be like us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING PERFECTED UNTO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are under His perfecting to make us useful members of His Body. Ephesians 4:11 and 12 tell us that He gave to His Body, the church, some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherd-teachers to perfect the saints. Verse 12 says that we are being perfected unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. Eventually the perfected ones will do the work of the ministry just as the gifted ones do. The apostle Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years to do this perfecting work (Acts 20:31). He said that he taught publicly and from house to house (v. 20). He also said that he admonished each one with tears (v. 31). <em>From house to house</em> means that Paul taught in all the homes of the saints.</p>
<p>Because the saints in Ephesus had received Paul&rsquo;s perfecting, he was able to write the marvelous Epistle of Ephesians to them. He was present with them for three years to get them prepared so that he could write that Epistle. Chapter one of Ephesians reveals the dispensing of the Divine Trinity and the transfusing of the ascended Christ. Chapter two reveals the masterpiece in God&rsquo;s new creation and the creation of the new man. Chapter three shows us God&rsquo;s eternal economy and Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts. Chapter four unveils the divine mingling and the growing in the Body of Christ. It also shows us the building up of the Body by itself and the renewing in the Spirit. Chapters five and six show us the matters of union and fighting. Our marriage union with Christ is in chapter five, and our fighting the spiritual warfare for dealing with God&rsquo;s enemy is in chapter six. This corresponds with Revelation 19. In this chapter we see the marriage union of Christ and His bride (vv. 7-9). Right away the bride and Bridegroom become an army to fight against and defeat Antichrist and his followers (vv. 14-21). Paul could release the book of Ephesians to the saints in Ephesus because they had been prepared and perfected by spending three years in his presence.</p>
<p>We surely need to practice Ephesians 4:12. All of our brothers and sisters in the Lord in the recovery should be perfected unto the work of the ministry, that is, unto the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. We are not merely winning souls in our preaching of the gospel. We are endeavoring to carry out Ephesians 4:12. Today God is seeking perfected ones. I hope that we would contact people and talk to people in a perfected way according to the principle of incarnation. We need to pay off our debt in the gospel in the way revealed in this message.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BECOMING VITAL THROUGH PRAYER,<br />
PREPARING OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES, AND REDEEMING OUR TIME TO LEARN THE TRUTH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING VITAL THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>Now we have to start our action for the increase. Recently I visited a group of saints, and I made a very positive discovery. I found out that they were not vital and that they do not pray much. They have not gotten into the prayer life. The only way that we can touch the Spirit is by prayer. In the Bible the Spirit is linked with our prayer. Praying and the Spirit are one. If we are without prayer, we will be without the Spirit. Of course, we can also say that without the Spirit, there can be no prayer. This is why we are told that we have to pray in spirit (Eph. 6:18). Since we are regenerated believers in Christ, our human spirit and the Holy Spirit are mingled together as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>If we do not pray even for one day, we have the feeling that we are short of the Spirit. When we pray, even with just a few sentences, we have the feeling that we are touching the Spirit. We all need to have a time with the Lord every morning in prayer. If you do not pray in the morning for one week, you will be dead spiritually. There is no other way to be vital except by prayer. We have to pray and get into a prayer life.</p>
<p>Most of us are living in a situation in which it is difficult to find a solid time of half an hour to pray. Whenever we set aside a definite time to pray, the enemy will always try to disturb us. When we begin to pray, someone may knock on our door or call us on the telephone. We may not have any telephone calls for a long period of time, but as soon as we begin to pray, the telephone will ring. Eventually, after three phone calls, our heart for prayer may be gone. We may have to wait for a period of time until we can be recovered back to prayer. It is not easy for us to pray for half an hour without being disturbed. We need to look to the Lord so that we can free ourselves from all distractions to have solid times of prayer with Him. Prayer makes us vital. We have to take the lead to be vital. If we are not vital, we cannot pray for others to be vital.</p>
<p>To be vital means to be released in the spirit, and this cannot be performed. If we pray for half an hour, we will be released. If we are not released, we are not vital. To contact people we have to be released persons. If we are not bound, we will be able to release others. A dejected, weeping person cannot make other people happy. If we are going to make people happy, we have to be happy persons. We can only help people to be what we are. In order to go out to effectively labor in the gospel, we must be vital.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES</h2>
<p>Before going out, we must have some preparation. First, we must prepare some candidates for us to go to visit. We need to consider all of our relatives, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, and friends. Out of these ones whom we know, we need to choose some to labor on for the gospel. Of course, we have to do this by prayer. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, who are the best two or three right now for me to work on?&rdquo; I shared in a previous message that we all should make a list of the people we know who need to be saved. When we read this list prayerfully, we will have some kind of inner registration of the two or three whom we should labor on now. We have to consider their situation and labor on them appropriately.</p>
<p>We need to consider all of our acquaintances, and we need the proper discernment in our consideration of whom we should labor on. We should spend our time to labor on those whom we consider to be promising and not waste our time on others who are not open. In our group meetings we should pray and study our candidates for the gospel together. We need to consider people&rsquo;s condition, especially spiritually, and then act appropriately to meet their need in the gospel. We need to decide how we should visit a certain person and who would be the right one or ones to go.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE TRUTH<br />
AND LEARNING THE PROPER WAY<br />
TO PRESENT THE TRUTH TO GAIN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>How you talk to a person is crucial, and how you answer his questions is more crucial. Your word may save him, or it could delay him for many years. A person may have a question, and although you may speak many things from the Bible to answer him, he will not receive anything.</p>
<p>If a person asks you what eternal life is, you should not answer him in a complicated way. You should answer him strictly and simply. You may say, &ldquo;Eternal life is God Himself, and God is Jesus Christ. Therefore, eternal life is just Jesus Christ. Today Christ is the Spirit with us. He is waiting for a time to enter into you to be your eternal life. Would you receive Him?&rdquo; Then he may ask, &ldquo;By what way?&rdquo; Then you can lead him to pray and call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. Within a short time this person will be helped to know what eternal life is, who is eternal life, and how he can receive this life. Eternal life is God, God today is Jesus Christ, and He is the Spirit. By praying and calling upon the name of the Lord we can receive Him into us to be our very life.</p>
<p>When we go to visit someone, we should not speak too many points to him. Otherwise, he will be complicated and receive nothing. If we go to visit someone and speak many points to him in a complicating way, our speaking will delay him. He may feel that the things in the Bible are too hard to understand, and his interest will be gone. Then he will not want to have any further contact with us. This will delay him for many years. We should be in fear and trembling when we contact people (1 Cor. 2:3). We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, how should I answer this person? Help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You also need to know the proper Bible verses, especially those verses which are referred to as &ldquo;golden verses.&rdquo; Surely you have to remember John 3:16, but in John 3 there are other crucial verses. Verses 3 and 5 speak of being born anew, being regenerated, to enter into the kingdom of God. You need to know the best verses concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning Christ&rsquo;s blood, concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and concerning all the crucial truths related to the gospel. Your answers to people should be concise and to the point. It is somewhat simple for me to coach you, but for you to do it is not that simple. This needs your practice.</p>
<p>In our vital group meetings, we need to spend some time to study our gospel candidates. After we go to contact a person, the following week we should give a report in the group meeting of our experience. Then we should look to the Lord and fellowship about how to take the next step with this person.</p>
<p>We must remember that in our gospel labor we are fishers of men (Matt. 4:19), and human society is like a big ocean full of fish. Certain fish may be very hard to catch, so we should not spend our time on them. We need to go to the fish that are available for us to catch. This is why we need the proper discernment concerning whom we should labor on. God surely loves everyone, but I am not talking about God loving the world. I am speaking about how to &ldquo;hook&rdquo; people with the limited amount of time available to us.</p>
<p>We must have something to meet people&rsquo;s need. If a person goes to a store to buy something, and the store does not carry what he wants, he will go away unhappy. But if he finds a store that carries what he needs, he will surely be happy. We must have something to meet people&rsquo;s need. Furthermore, we may have something, but do we know how to present what we have? We need to learn to present things to people in a way that they can receive them. We should learn to present the truth of the gospel according to the practical situation of our daily life. This requires our practice. To become proficient in any kind of athletic endeavor, a person must practice all the time. Our success in reaching people with the gospel for the increase of the Body of Christ all depends upon our practice.</p>
<p>I hope that we will get ourselves prepared to come to the following group meeting. We need to come prepared with the gospel candidates whom we feel we should labor on. Then we can consider how to go to them and begin our labor together in the gospel. When we labor on certain ones, we must be consistent. We should not hope that within three months someone will be saved and within another half year another one will be saved. It may be that the three for whom we are burdened will not be saved until two years have passed. In the past we may have been very busy, but we did not bear any fruit. We must pray to get a few definite candidates. Then we need to work on them. We need to learn how to concentrate our work in order to get some definite results.</p><h2 class="head1">ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h2>
<p><em>Question:</em> Would it be more beneficial for us not to invite new ones to our vital groups right away, but rather to spend time with them in their homes first?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Whether or not you invite them to the vital groups should not be a rule, a legal regulation. It all depends on the need. You have to consider whether or not it would be a help to bring a certain new one to your group right away. In certain cases it might be safer for you to go with another brother to see him for a period of time until you feel he is ready to come to a group meeting.</p>
<p>If your neighbor is an open Christian and a seeker after the truth, you need to present the truth to him. It might even be good to spend some time with him to study a book of the Bible together. You could even study the truth concerning God&rsquo;s predestination of us unto sonship from the book of Ephesians. You should not try to do too much at one time. Perhaps just a fifteen minute time with him once or twice a week would be sufficient. Nothing can convince people as much as the truth, especially with a truth-seeking Christian.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Someone asked me what we mean when we say that a believer in Christ is a God-man. They wondered if this means we are saying that we are omniscient as God is. How should we answer this question?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> The Bible reveals that we believers in Christ have God&rsquo;s life (John 3:15-16, 36) and God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4) because we have become God&rsquo;s children and have been born of God (John 1:12-13), but this does not mean that we have His Godhead. Only He is the One to be worshipped. He is almighty, omniscient, and the unique One to be worshipped, but we are not. When you share this with him, make sure you refer him to some verses in the Bible which show that we have God&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<p>Do not merely tell him that we have God&rsquo;s nature. You need to read 2 Peter 1:4 to him to show him that we are partakers of the divine nature. This verse shows that we believers have the way to get away from this age and the lust of this age. The unbelievers have no way, but we believers have the way because we have the holy nature of God. Because we have the nature of God and God&rsquo;s nature is holy, we also can be holy and can be kept from the lusts of this age, from the current of the world. By saying this, I believe he will get the help. That means he will be fed by you.</p>
<p>Since we are lovers of the Lord Jesus, we must realize that we have much to learn in order to be a proper Christian. In order to learn adequately, we need to redeem our time. A brother may come home from work and have ten minutes before he eats dinner. He can spend those ten minutes to read 2 Peter 1:4 and some of the accompanying notes in the Recovery Version. While a mother is taking care of her children, she can look for opportunities to open up her Bible and read a verse. This is the way to learn things. We learn things bit by bit, little by little.</p>
<p>My concern is for your prayer, for your experience of the Spirit, and for your learning. Do you really mean business to learn? Your time in the vital groups is a golden time for you to learn. You can learn with the other members in the vital group and practice what you have learned. With your experience in the vital groups and the coaching you receive in these messages, you can learn much.</p>
<p>I came into the center of the work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in a practical way in Shanghai in 1933. Two years later in 1935 Brother Nee went to another locality to hold a conference. In that conference he said that there was a brother among us by the name of Brother Lee whose progress in the Lord was like a person who was not just running but flying. A brother who was in that meeting reported this to me fifteen years later when I was ministering in Manila. Whenever I heard something out of Brother Nee&rsquo;s mouth which I did not understand, I always studied it right away. Do you all really learn, or do you come to the ministry and training meetings merely to hear? If so, you cannot pick up too much. You have to learn.</p>
<p>Since you heard something about 2 Peter 1:4, you should read this verse and study it with the help of the notes in the Recovery Version. You may remember that this verse speaks of our being partakers of the divine nature, but because you do not remember the entire verse, you may not be able to say too much. Second Peter 1:4 says, &ldquo;Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&rdquo; This verse is really precious. To have or to partake of God&rsquo;s divine nature has something to do with escaping the corruption which is in the world by lust. Also it is through the precious and exceedingly great promises that you become partakers of His divine nature. If you are to partake of the divine nature, you must go through God&rsquo;s promises.</p>
<p>You need to learn what all these things mean. Through these precious and great promises, you can partake of, taste, experience, the nature of God. This verse by itself would need an entire message to expound adequately. What are these promises? Most of you would say that you do not know. Why does the divine nature have so much to do with escaping from the corruption of this world by lust? Even the corruption of the world by lust needs a lot of explanation. If you study this verse thoroughly, you can say a lot to your colleague about it. Then you can convince him. You need to give yourself to learn the truth. Do not say you have no time. Everyone has time. You need to learn to redeem your time.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What is the difference between prayer and petition? Does prayer include fellowship with the Lord?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Petition is more particular, whereas prayer is general. Of course, in your prayer and your petition, whenever you open up your mouth to say something to the Lord, that is a kind of fellowship. Prayer and petition are both a kind of fellowship. Petition implies that you have a particular burden to pray for certain things. You may pray for the vital groups in a general way. But sometimes you may be burdened to petition the Lord concerning the vital groups. You may separate half a day to specifically petition the Lord for all the groups to become vital. Then you may be burdened further to even fast by skipping a meal to petition the Lord concerning the vital groups. You would be burdened to petition the Lord for only one thing&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, make all the groups vital. Make me vital, Lord.&rdquo; The words <em>prayer</em> and <em>petition</em> are used in Ephesians 6:18 and Philippians 4:6. Prayer is mentioned first and then petition.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You mentioned some golden verses which we need to know in order to meet people&rsquo;s need. Can you give us some of these verses?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> There are many of these verses in the Bible, but we can mention some of them. Concerning the existence of God, you must use Romans 1:19-20: &ldquo;Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them. For the invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; This is the top portion of Scripture to show people the existence of God. The creation is a strong evidence of God&rsquo;s existence. You cannot see God, so you do not know His existence, but you can see His creation. In the creation you can see God&rsquo;s eternal power and divine characteristics. Because of the beauty of creation, God must be a God of beauty. God created so many living things, so He must be a God of life. God is living. This is one of God&rsquo;s characteristics.</p>
<p>The best verse for Christ&rsquo;s redemption is Romans 3:24&mdash; &ldquo;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse on Christ&rsquo;s redemption should also be read with verses 25 and 26. Verse 25 speaks of Christ being the propitiation place, which refers to the lid, the cover, of the ark in the Holy of Holies. The lid, the cover, of the ark is a type of Christ. Upon Christ, God justifies us and meets with us. God talks to us upon Christ, because the cover of the ark was the place where God met with man. We pray to God there and God answers us there.</p>
<p>The best verses for justification are in Romans and Galatians. Romans 3:20 says, &ldquo;Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him.&rdquo; Galatians 2:16 also says, &ldquo;Out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.&rdquo; These are the best verses on the negative side, whereas Romans 3:24 is the best verse on the positive side.</p>
<p>The best verse for Christ&rsquo;s blood is 1 Peter 1:19 which speaks of the precious blood of Christ. This is the only verse that refers to Christ&rsquo;s blood as &ldquo;precious blood.&rdquo; The best verses for the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling are Romans 8:9 and 11.</p>
<p>The best verse to tell us that when we believe in the Lord Jesus we receive eternal life is John 3:16. We also need to realize that verses 14 through 16 of John 3 show us that Christ was crucified on the cross that we may have eternal life. Verses 14 and 15 say, &ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; When you read such a verse, you must stress the word <em>that</em>. The Son of Man was lifted up <em>that</em> everyone who believes into Him might have eternal life. If you do not believe that the Lord Jesus died on the cross for you, you could never have His eternal life.</p>
<p>The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses train their people with many verses in order to spread their heresy. They twist the verses regarding Christ&rsquo;s deity because they do not believe that Christ is God. Romans 9:5 says, &ldquo;Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; We all admit that these words refer to Christ&rsquo;s deity. Christ is God, who is over all and blessed forever. But the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses change the punctuation and wording in this verse to change its meaning. They train their people very particularly on Romans 9:5 in order to prove Christ is not God. They also twist John 1:1 which says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; By their twisting they teach the great heresy that Christ is not God. The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses believe this strongly. They train their people with many verses. If they are like this, surely we should be the same with regard to the divine truths. We should be trained with verses to show the truth concerning Christ being God and to show all the precious divine truths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The best verses on God&rsquo;s salvation in life are Romans 5:10 and 17. Verse 10 says that we are reconciled through Christ&rsquo;s death and that we will be saved in His life. Verse 17 shows that we shall be saved by God in life to such an extent that we will reign in life.</p>
<p>How could we prove with verses from the Bible that the tree of life is a figure of God? We first need to read Psalm 36:9 which says, &ldquo;For with You [God] is the fountain of life.&rdquo; Genesis 2:9 speaks of the tree of life. In John 14:6a the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am...the life,&rdquo; and in 10:10 He said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; Furthermore, Jesus told us in John 15:1 that He was a tree, the vine tree. By these verses you can prove that the tree of life must signify God embodied in Christ.</p>
<p>Recently someone who appreciated the life-study of the book of Genesis asked me a few questions. Genesis 3 says that God came to seek after Adam and made coats of skins to clothe him and his wife (v. 21). This person asked whether or not God Himself was clothed when He came to Adam. How would you answer such a question? You should say that God was in His glory, and His glory was His covering. In Isaiah 6, God was sitting on the throne with a robe, and that robe was His glory (vv. 1, 3; cf. John 12:41 and note 1). Furthermore, when God came to Abraham in Genesis 18, He appeared to him as a man with man&rsquo;s clothing. These questions show us how we need to spend our time to learn the Bible, so that we can meet the need of the new ones.</p>
<p>This person also asked another question related to Genesis 3. After man fell God said, &ldquo;Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil&rdquo; (v. 22). So God closed the way to the tree of life. This person said that on the one hand God wants us to be like Him, but on the other hand it seems that God did not allow us to be like Him. He also said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been good if God would have let fallen man eat the tree of life? Then the tree of life would have come into the fallen man to fight against his fallen nature.&rdquo; He asked why God would not do this. How would you answer such a question? (See <em>Life-study of Genesis,</em> Message Twenty-one, pp. 281-282, for God&rsquo;s reason for closing the way to the tree of life after man&rsquo;s fall.) This shows that in order to help people, you need much learning. Otherwise, you will only be able to tell them that you do not know.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FRUIT-BEARING AND<br />
THE DESPERATE PRAYER LIFE</h1>
<p>In this message we want to consider the purpose of the vital groups. Many of the groups have been coming together to pray earnestly and have been laboring for about seven months, but what has come out of this? The outward situation among us may not seem that encouraging because we have not yet seen some definite results. The saints in the book of Acts prayed together for ten days. The result was the outpouring of the Spirit (2:2-4) and three thousand added to the church (v. 41). We may expect a similar great result after we pray together for a short period of time. We may be discouraged since we have not yet seen much of a result.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD IN MATTHEW, MARK, AND LUKE<br />
REGARDING PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We need to consider the Lord&rsquo;s word to us in the Gospels regarding preaching the gospel and gaining the increase. At the end of Matthew, the Lord charged us to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (28:19). At the end of Mark, He charged us to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation (16:15). Mark tells us that miracles would follow the disciples&rsquo; preaching of the gospel (vv. 17-18). At the end of Luke, the Lord told the disciples to wait at Jerusalem until they would be clothed with power from on high (24:49). Then they would have the impact for people to receive the gospel of the forgiveness of sins (v. 47).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF FRUIT-BEARING<br />
IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>We may expect such power and instant results in our gospel labor, but we need to go on to see what the Gospel of John says. There is not a charge to proclaim the gospel at the end of John as there is in the synoptic Gospels. The last chapter of John describes a situation in which Peter became disappointed. Because of his disappointment, he went fishing, going back to his old occupation (21:3). When he took the lead to go fishing, the other disciples followed him. They fished through the entire night and caught nothing, but in the morning the Lord suddenly appeared to them and told them to cast their net on the right side of the boat. When they did this, they caught an abundance of fish (v. 6).</p>
<p>John tells us they caught one hundred fifty-three fish (v. 11). But without these fish, and even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord prepared fish and bread for His disciples (v. 9). In John 21 the Lord Jesus did not come to charge the disciples to go and disciple the nations. He was training them to have faith in Him for their living. The first word the Lord uttered to them was this: &ldquo;Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?&rdquo; (v. 5). This shows that He was caring for their daily living, their daily necessity.</p>
<p>After they had eaten breakfast, the Lord asked Peter three times if he loved Him. Peter was not bold to say as he did before the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion that he would never deny the Lord. Peter responded by telling the Lord that he loved Him, and he eventually said, &ldquo;Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You&rdquo; (v. 17). After Peter&rsquo;s responses to His questions, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep (vv. 15-17). This is the Gospel of John&rsquo;s way to tell us how to bear the remaining fruit of the gospel.</p>
<p>John speaks directly about bearing fruit, however, not at the end of his Gospel but in chapter fifteen. In verse 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; John does not speak of preaching the gospel as the other Gospels do. He speaks of fruit-bearing. The vine bears fruit only once a year. If you want fruit from the vine, you cannot pray and have much fruit the next morning. That would be a real miracle, but the bearing of fruit by the vine is not like this. If you look at the vine today, it seems that it is the same as it was yesterday because the season has not yet come for it to bear fruit. Besides having no fruit, it may not even have any blossoms.</p>
<p>The real fruit-bearing in the Christian life is just like the vine. It is yearly and according to season. The period of time before the bearing of fruit in its season will test you. You may think that you are waiting to bear fruit and that this waiting is a waste of time. But if you would ask the vine, the vine would say that the time was not wasted. That time is not a waiting period for the vine but part of a producing period. The vine is in the stage of producing even in the winter, and eventually in its season the fruit appears.</p>
<p>John 15 is a very valuable and deep chapter in the Bible. A number of Bible teachers teach only the abiding in the Lord from this chapter. Actually, however, John 15 stresses the bearing of fruit. Abiding is not for the sake of abiding; abiding is for the sake of fruit-bearing. If you abide in the Lord for your whole life and do not bear any fruit, your abiding means nothing. The stress in John 15 is not on abiding. The key is abiding, but the stress is fruit-bearing. We can have the fruit-bearing by abiding.</p>
<p>For the branch to abide in the vine is the living of a life under all kinds of conditions&mdash;the sunshine, the blowing wind, the rain, the heat, and the cold. In other words, to abide in the Lord is to live a life in Him under all kinds of suffering. Actually the vine tree suffers day and night for and until the season when it will produce its fruit (see <em>Hymns,</em> #635).</p>
<p>It was not our decision to choose to be a branch of Christ, the true vine. The Lord said, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you....&rdquo; (John 15:16). The word &ldquo;set&rdquo; is a strong word. It is not just that the Lord has appointed us or arranged something for us but that He has set us. This is our destiny. The destiny of the lovers of Christ is to bear fruit.</p>
<p>According to John 15, fruit-bearing is not an easy thing (vv. 18-25). The vine suffers for many months before its season comes to bear fruit. After the fruit of the vine is harvested, the whole vine is stripped. In the winter the vine endures the cold and the snow until the spring begins. Then it begins once again to bear fruit. The fruit-bearing process is a process of suffering the sunshine, the blowing wind, and the rain. The Song of Songs even speaks of &ldquo;the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines&rdquo; (2:15). The foxes love the tender grapes of the vine. We need to be impressed with this picture. The vine can bear fruit only in its season through much suffering. Someone may want fruit from the vine right away, but the vine cannot produce this fruit until its season comes through suffering.</p>
<p>I have been speaking about our need to bear fruit for the Lord&rsquo;s increase since 1984, but most of the saints expect instant results. They may think that they can pray for a short period of time, and then the Lord will sovereignly arrange for them to meet someone who will be saved and added to the church. In Taipei we contacted half a million homes and baptized thirty-eight thousand people in less than seventeen months, but we did not see much remaining fruit from this.</p>
<p>If George M&#252;ller were here, he would tell us that to bear fruit is not a quick thing. He made a list of people and prayed for them daily until each of them was saved. In his autobiography he said that there was still one person for whom he was praying that was still not saved. But after he died this person was saved by the Lord. We must see that fruit-bearing is a seasonal matter. It is the same with bearing children. Once a woman has conceived a child, she must wait for nine months to deliver this child. The time of the child&rsquo;s birth cannot be decided by her.</p>
<p>We should not think that our meeting together for about seven months in the vital groups has been a wasted time. We must remember that the bearing of fruit is according to the proper season. On the other hand, some vine trees may not bear any fruit for one reason or another. This means that the vine lived in vain for one year with no fruit. The vine did not bear fruit because it lived wrongly. Whether or not we will gain some fruit by the end of the year depends upon how we live in the coming months.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING A VITAL PERSON, AN OVERCOMER,<br />
A PRAYING PERSON HAVING THE REAL BURDEN<br />
FOR PRAYER, TO RESCUE THE CHURCH<br />
FROM ITS DEGRADATION</h2>
<p>We need to remember that our groups must be vital groups. The Bible talks about vital people. What is an overcomer? An overcomer is a vital person. Then what is it to be vital so that we can be overcomers? A vital person, an overcomer, is a praying person. You must have the real burden for the real prayer. Recently, I told some co-workers that their prayer did not come out of any burden. If we come together just to shout a few sentences, is this a burden of prayer? This is formality. It is a formal performance.</p>
<p>We have seen in a previous message that Brother Nee said we should not pray anything that is not real prayer. Many prayers that we pray actually are not prayers. They are repetitions of statements according to our tradition. The real burden of prayer is not a composition. When the blind man prayed to the Lord, he did not pray a composed prayer. When the Lord Jesus asked him what he wanted, the blind man said, &ldquo;Lord, that I may receive my sight!&rdquo; (Luke 18:41). This is real prayer out of a real burden. He was burdened to contact Jesus so that he could see, and the Lord answered his prayer. But our prayers mostly are not like this. Our prayers, even our personal prayers, are mostly a religious form and a kind of performance.</p>
<p>Then we may ask, &ldquo;How can we be burdened for prayer?&rdquo; This is a matter of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. I cannot forget the vital groups, because that is my real burden. I cannot forget the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because His recovery is my burden. I always have to pray to the Lord for His recovery. When I pray and cry, &ldquo;O Lord, the recovery,&rdquo; this is out of some burden. Once we begin to pray for the recovery, we realize that we cannot finish our prayer. There are many places and persons for which we have to pray. We need to be vital, and to be vital is to have the real burden for prayer. There is the need of the real prayer among us. What the vital groups should have a burden to pray is this: &ldquo;Lord, the church needs the proper increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of some rebellious ones who were among us, our number was damaged and our morale was spoiled. If we love the church, we should be desperate to pray, even to pray with fasting. Our meetings should be full of real prayers, not formal prayers. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, we just cannot go on without the proper increase, especially among the Caucasians.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is the real prayer. We should not merely meet according to our schedule to fulfill a formal duty. The prayer of some among us is too traditional. There is no burden or desperation in their prayer. We need to be desperate. The going on of the vital groups to gain the increase should be a life or death matter with us. Even if we are not scheduled to meet, there should still be a burden in us to come together to pray.</p>
<p>I recently checked with some of the groups concerning what they were doing, but no one told me that they were praying desperately for the vital groups. Instead they told me about other activities in their groups. When I heard this, I was concerned that we were making the groups something that is not vital. The vitality is not in your doing. The vitality is in your prayer. If someone asks you what you are doing in your group, it would be wonderful to hear you say, &ldquo;We just cannot live without prayer. We are desperate with the Lord. Everybody prayed. We only have the time to pray.&rdquo; This is what I like to hear. You must have some vital prayer with some vital burden.</p>
<p>In order to have the vital groups, we ourselves need to be vital. We need to pray desperately, &ldquo;Lord, we ask You, when the season comes, to give each one of us two people who are remaining fruit. Otherwise, we cannot go on.&rdquo; We should pray and pray until the Lord answers our prayer. We should not be discouraged or disappointed, but have the full assurance that He will fulfill His word. This is because He told us that He has chosen us and set us to go forth to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain.</p>
<p>If you have this kind of prayer with a burden, every time you pray you will get the Spirit. You will get the infilling Spirit and the outpoured Spirit. Our meetings should not be an empty performance but meetings full of the Spirit. Our vital group training meeting is not a common meeting. This is a meeting for the overcomers to rescue the church from its degradation. If the vital groups fail, there is no way for the Lord to do anything.</p>
<p>One brother recently told me that the vital groups really work. But I wondered if this brother really knew what he meant when he said this. Whether or not the vital groups work depends upon how much prayer you offer to the Lord. Then you will have the Spirit. You will be a Spirit-filled person according to what Acts 13:52 says&mdash;&ldquo;The disciples were filled...with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; If you are a person of prayer, you will be a person living, walking, and doing everything in your spirit. You will not be so loose and easily talk about others. You will be greatly limited, restricted, in your spirit.</p>
<p>Then you will have a real burden to produce fruit. You will contact people, and this will be very different from all your contacts in the past. If you are vital, your contacts will sense that something real is within you. Otherwise, the people whom you contact will not receive anything. If you are vital, something of life will be ministered to the ones you contact.</p>
<p>By this time we should have some gospel candidates in our consideration and prayers. We should have the assurance that by the end of the year, we will have one or two as remaining fruit. But this all depends upon how we spend these coming months. The season for fruit is not today but in the months to come. We have to labor. To have a human birth after conception takes nine months. To have the fruit on a vine takes about one year. These are the laws in nature according to God&rsquo;s creation. Even when God became incarnated, He stayed in the human womb for nine months. He kept the law which He established in nature.</p>
<p>I hope that my word here will encourage us. We should be desperate for the Lord&rsquo;s interests on this earth. This is our destiny. We need to aspire to be the overcomers to rescue the church from its degradation. There is no verse in the New Testament which tells us that the closer we are to the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the better the church will be. There is not such a thing. On the contrary, the closer we are to the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the more degraded the church will become. The victory will be with the overcomers. They will be raptured early, and they will be the ones who will consummate this age. This age will be consummated only because of the overcomers. Of course, we still need a church life. No one can be an overcomer without a church life. If you isolate yourself from the church and neglect the church, there is no way for you to be an overcomer.</p>
<p>The book of Judges shows us that Israel became degraded to the uttermost. But still that degraded nation of Israel kept a piece of land on which Christ could come to tread. Without the degraded nation of Israel, that piece of land would not have been there. Also, Israel produced Boaz and Ruth to bring forth Obed, who begot David&rsquo;s father, Jesse (Matt. 1:5-6), and it also produced another couple, Mary and Joseph, to bring forth Christ. The church may be defeated, but God can never be defeated. He has His way. We still need the church life that can maintain us in the overcoming life, but we should not be satisfied just to be in the church. To be in the church is one thing, but to be in the church and to be an overcomer is another thing.</p>
<p>The vital groups need overcomers. Even the vital groups need some vital groups within them to rescue them. After a little degradation, we are no longer vital. Without prayer, without being in the Holy Spirit and your human spirit, you can never be vital. Do not think that if you attend all the vital group meetings, you are vital. Being vital depends upon whether you are vital in prayer in the Holy Spirit and in your human spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD CONCERNING THE BAPTISMS<br />
AND CARE FOR OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES</h2>
<p>Now I would like to say a word concerning the baptisms of our gospel candidates. I do not think it is wise to baptize our new ones hastily, especially the Caucasians. If we baptize them lightly, that will spoil them. We have to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading in this matter. Perhaps we could set up a baptism meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to make their baptism a very stately matter. Then we can bring those who are really ripe for baptism and baptize them in a stately meeting.</p>
<p>If you feel that some of your candidates can be brought to the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting, you may do this. But you have to make our meeting understandable to them. To bring in the Chinese is somewhat easy today, especially with those who have come here from mainland China. But we cannot expect this with the proper class of Caucasians. Many of them are very considerate. They may have a religious background, but they do not want to go to their denomination because it does not satisfy them. A number of denominations are full of old people, but they do not have many middle-aged members. Many middle-aged people do not meet regularly in a certain place. Instead, they are church wanderers, church travelers. But some of them still have a seeking heart. If you present something real of Christ to them, they will be attracted. But you have to be careful not to give them the impression that you are involved in some religious formality. Otherwise, they will be damaged. All the time you have to keep them in a feeling that you are ministering to them something really spiritual of Christ. That will convince them, and that will keep them.</p>
<p>It might be easier to bring them to Christ but more difficult to bring them into the church life. You should anticipate the need to spend much time on them in prayer and labor. This year you may bring them into Christ, but that still may not be the time to bring them to the church life. You may have to wait another time for this. There is no need to be anxious and hurried concerning their baptism or their coming into the church life. We must keep in mind that the vital groups need to gain the proper Caucasians through much prayer and labor.</p>
<p>In conclusion I would encourage us to sing and to pray <em>Hymns,</em> #279 to the Lord:</p>

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BECOMING VITAL AND<br />
GOING TO VITALIZE OTHERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>By 1984 the recovery had come to a point of being dormant. At that time I felt burdened to go to Taiwan to study our situation. I was endeavoring to bring us into the God-ordained, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Through five years of study, from 1984 to 1989, the Lord clearly showed us the God-ordained way.</p>
<p>The term <em>the God-ordained way</em> was invented by us, and we saw that this God-ordained way revealed in the Scriptures is of four steps: begetting, feeding, perfecting, and building. We need to beget, to produce, new believers. Then we need to feed them that they may grow. Then we need to perfect them, not by one teacher but through the mutual teaching in the groups. In the groups everyone is a teacher, and every teacher is a student. Through the mutual teaching in the groups the new ones are perfected unto the work of the ministry as pointed out in Ephesians 4:12. This makes them qualified to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, for the building up of the church. To take the God-ordained way is by these four steps, but how do we carry them out? We found out that the way to carry out these four steps is by the vital groups.</p>
<p>In 1949 we started the work in Taipei with about three to five hundred saints. Within less than five years, we grew to fifty thousand. During that period of time, I felt we needed the groups. Just to have the halls for the district work was not adequate, so we set up groups. We decided to have about twenty saints to a group, but the groups grew to fifty, sixty, and seventy saints. Some even grew to one hundred. The group leaders were very active ones in the church life.</p>
<p>From 1958 to 1984, however, the church in Taipei had gradually dropped the practice of group meetings and unconsciously drifted back to focus on the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening. In every hall there was a speaker to take care of this message meeting. We had drifted away from the practice of the group meetings to a kind of Sunday morning service with one speaker.</p>
<p>We have to realize that a big and top advantage of the group meetings is that they should make everyone function. Our vital groups have not yet reached that standard of making everyone function according to the God-ordained way with its four steps: to beget, to feed, to perfect by mutual teaching, and to prophesy for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>After we released the truth concerning the group meetings, the churches attempted to pick up this practice. But what they eventually had was not vital groups, but mostly dormant groups. I became very clear within that in order to come out of our dormant condition we must stress the practice of the vital group meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A VITAL GROUP BEING LIVING<br />
AND FULL OF ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>Recently I felt burdened to use the term <em>vital groups</em>. My understanding in using the word <em>vital</em> is that a vital group is living and full of activities. You may be a living person, but if you do not know how to take any action, you are not vital. Children from the ages of five to seven are vital because they are not only living but full of activities. Spiritually speaking, we may be living but we are not vital because we are not living and full of activities. To be vital is to be living and very active, full of activities. The vital groups are groups which are living and full of activities. If the saints who have the burden to be in the vital groups do not move, do not act, in any kind of meeting, the church is finished.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BECOME VITAL</h2>
<p>We have made it clear that the way to produce the vital groups is that each of us must take the lead to be vital. In order to be vital, we first must have a thorough fellowship with the Lord. Then that fellowship will bring us into a kind of realization that we are totally sinful. Then we will be brought into a thorough confession of our sins. Spontaneously, we will re-consecrate ourselves. We will pray, &ldquo;Lord, now I would like to consecrate myself to You anew.&rdquo; Then that will bring us into a prayer life. No one can pray unceasingly without reaching this stage. When we pass through the stages of fellowship, confession, and consecration, we enter into a prayer life. It is in this prayer life that we pray ourselves into the Spirit&mdash;the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit. Then we learn how to follow this Spirit by exercising our spirit. If this is the case with us, we are really vital. Actually, this is all revealed, unveiled, in the New Testament, especially in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<p>The overcomers are the vital members. If we read the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, we can see that the overcomers are vital. The overcomers in God&rsquo;s economy will be the ones who give God the way to consummate this age, to bring Christ back, and to recover His title and right over the earth through Christ&rsquo;s reign. Christ will reign and the overcomers will reign with Him as His co-kings. We must remember that to be vital is to overcome.</p>
<p>When we are vital, we will have a burden to contact others. This will not be something done merely because the elders made a decision. The elders may make a decision to divide the saints in the church into groups and call these groups vital groups, but they may be dormant groups. If we merely arrange the saints into groups and call them vital groups, that is something formal. That is just a movement. Eventually, these groups will be the same as the old groups. This is not the way to have the vital groups. We must abandon that way and take the vital way.</p>
<p>We will not be vital if we do not pass through the stages of fellowship, the confession of our sins, re-consecration, a prayer life, and the filling of the Spirit. Also, we need to have a thorough and intimate fellowship with one another. We may come together as groups, and yet not have this kind of fellowship. Instead, we are all very reserved. We open up ourselves to a certain extent and no more. We like to cover and hide many things concerning our situation. As a result, there is no thorough fellowship. When there is no thorough fellowship, there is no thorough blending. Then we cannot see the proper mutual intercession, the proper mutual care, and the proper mutual shepherding. This shows that we are not that vital.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING ACTION TO CONTACT<br />
THE SAINTS WHO ARE NOT IN THE GROUPS<br />
AND WHO ARE NOT YET VITAL</h2>
<p>In the entire time of my ministry, I have not been as burdened as I am in these days concerning how the church should go on. Recently, I became clear that we must begin to take action, regardless of whether or not we feel that we have been adequately prepared. Without any burden of work, it is difficult to have a burden of prayer. The first step we need to take is to contact the saints who are not in the groups which we have. A number of the saints may be weaker and older, and they do not have the capacity to act that much and be in the vital groups. We should not go to contact them first, but go to contact the ones whom we feel can be made vital and whom we can bring into our vital groups. The first step in our action is not to contact the unbelieving sinners or our relatives and neighbors, but to contact the meeting members who are not yet vital. We need to pray and choose someone whom we can contact.</p>
<p>We may also feel led by the Lord to recover certain backsliding ones. Some of us should pick up the burden to recover them and make them vital. In recovering a backsliding one, we should not talk too much. Instead, we should go to visit him again and again. We should be prepared to take one year to recover one person. In these days we need to go to contact the ones who can be made vital, including certain ones who have backslidden. When they become vital, they may be more vital than we are.</p>
<p>On the average each of our groups has about eight persons. When you bring one to your group, this does not mean that he is vitalized yet. He is still not vitalized, but he may like to come to your vital group meeting. When we bring two more to join our group and we reach ten saints, we should divide our group into two groups of five each.</p>
<p>Sometimes the right person can get someone revived just by one contact. A certain brother may be working on another backslidden brother for three years, without anything happening. But someone else may have one contact with this backslidden one, and he may want to go to your group meeting just through that one contact.</p>
<p>Previously we said that we need to wait and consider when the time is ripe for us to bring a new one to the group meeting. In these days I feel that we should not wait. If they want to come to our group meetings, bring them in. When we reach ten saints in our group, we should divide into two groups of five. When a group of five brings a new one in, they should all work on that one to fully recover him, revive him, and make him vital. This is a mutual work.</p>
<p>Perhaps a brother who is being recovered would come to our meeting and ask, &ldquo;Why has the church become so dormant?&rdquo; One of the saints may say, &ldquo;I confess my responsibility. The church became dormant because of me. But, hallelujah, just three days ago I got revived.&rdquo; This is a kind of teaching and fellowship. Then the others may share their experience concerning being revived or the need to be revived. This is our mutual meeting, our vital group. If the five members of a group work on one saint in this way, he can be recovered and made vital. He may return home from the meeting and tell his wife how impressed he was with the functioning of all the saints and how he was touched by the Lord.</p>
<p>We should preach the gospel in the same way. We can bring our gospel contacts to the group. When they come to our group meeting, we must learn how to behave ourselves so that we do not stumble them. They may not know how to ask questions, but we can ask questions for them, and all of us can function to answer them in order to help them get saved.</p>
<p>Each of our vital group meetings presently has about eight members. When we gain two more and reach ten members, we should divide. We should use one evening each week to come together and bring our new contacts to the meeting. Regardless of how many contacts you have, bring them into your meeting. Then you need to learn. Do not learn to be dumb. Learn to be active. Learn to be vital, to speak. Do not be fearful of making mistakes. If you do not make mistakes, you will never learn. If no one among the five persons in the group says anything, this will be a dormant and dumb meeting. All of us must learn to be active and not be concerned about making mistakes. We all have to function, and we must be prepared to make mistakes and learn from these mistakes to be perfected. In these days we need to pray desperately with a real burden. Now is the time for us to fight the battle and gain those in the church who are not yet vital.</p>
<p>I believe that the way to help us be more vital is for us to contact others. If we wait any longer to contact others, we will never be vital. Every week we should set apart one day in which we contact others. We also need to have a vital group meeting one evening a week in addition to the regular meetings of the church. We still should attend the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and the prayer meeting.</p>
<p>We must set aside one day each week for the sake of gaining others. If we have the burden to recover someone who has not been in the meetings for a long time, we need to pray for him. We may even need to fast and pray. Then we will receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading to contact him, either by phoning him or going to visit him. If there is a will to gain people, there is a way to gain them. We believe this. We must ask the Lord to give us someone to gain for Him. We cannot be idle. We must gain someone who is not yet vitalized. We must bear a burden to vitalize that one, to make that one vital. Then we will realize that we first need to be vitalized.</p>
<p>After we have finished contacting all the non-vital members, including the backsliding ones, we can begin to contact the sinners, including our relatives, neighbors, and colleagues. We have to pray and ask the Lord to give us someone to labor on. If we have such a desire, the Lord will give us the proper persons. We need to pray desperately as we take action with the Lord to contact others. We should tell the Lord that we do not want to be dormant and that we do not want others in the church to be dormant. We need to be vitalized by the Lord and then go to vitalize others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING LIVING AND ACTIVE GROUPS TO GAIN OTHERS</h2>
<p>We have to make our group meetings so interesting. If our vital group meetings are full of truth, are living, and if we intimately love one another in the group, this will be a big attraction. We must have a living, active vital group. Then we should do our best to bring in the middle-aged ones.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee stressed that the priesthood in the New Testament is universal, so he encouraged all the saints to serve, to be priests. We have not yet had a complete success in this matter. After I came to the United States, the Lord showed us that we need to pray-read His Word and call upon His name. We also began to practice having a time in the meeting for the saints to share after a message was given. This helped to bring the saints into more functioning. But the most prevailing way to bring all the saints into function is for them to enter into the group meetings in a living and active way.</p>
<p>Our groups should not be dormant, lifeless, and cold. If our groups are like this, no one will want to attend them. We have to keep our group meetings so interesting, so living, and so attractive. People need a proper social life, but to be social in a worldly way leads to sin. The church social life in the recovery leads to light, to the deeper and higher truths, and to the divine life. I believe if we could get our practice exposed to others, they will be attracted. The group meetings which are living, attractive, and full of activities will be used by the Lord to gain others for the increase and building up of the church.</p>
<p>Everyone should bear a burden for the vital groups. Do not despise your burden and your portion. If a new one comes into a group meeting and all the members of the group meeting speak, he will be surprised and attracted. Our group meetings must be living and active, with all the members in the group speaking.</p>
<p>According to my experience, the most attractive thing is the thorough fellowship. In your vital groups, you must always practice the thorough, intimate fellowship. This brings in the mutual care in love. If a new one comes to our group and sees this kind of intimate, open, thorough fellowship and mutual care, he will be inspired. He would say that he has never seen people who are so one and who love, open to, and care for one another so much. He would say, &ldquo;This is the place where I should be. I have to be among these people.&rdquo; This kind of intimate fellowship and care for one another attracts people, so we have to practice this.</p>
<p>We must do everything we can to strengthen the vital groups. We should spend every drop of our blood, every bit of our strength, and every minute of our time to strengthen the vital groups, making the vital groups so beautiful, so high, and so attractive. This is the only thing we should stress to get people. A number of things can attract people, but not so effectively as the vital groups.</p><h1 class="series">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OVERCOMING THREE LAYERS OF OBSTACLES<br />
BY THE VITAL GROUPS</h1>
<p>In this message I would like to give some brief fellowship to help us see the need of the vital groups from a particular angle. Probably none of us has ever picked up this angle to look into the need of the vital groups. Why were we burdened to have such groups, and why did we pick up the word <em>vital?</em> I would like us to consider the reason for this from one particular angle, and this angle is the situation we have gradually come to in the United States.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE LAYERS OF OBSTACLES TO THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to this country in 1961 and we started our ministry in 1962. That was sixteen years after the end of the Second World War. Due to the war, the American psychology was changed quite much. At that time among the Christians, there was a remnant of seeking ones raised up by the Lord. By that time the United States had become the biggest country with Christianity as its main religion. This country had millions of Christians, both Catholics and Protestants. Mainly among the Protestants, the Lord gained a remnant, the real seeking ones. Sixteen years after the war, the recovery came, and the recovery was greatly welcomed by this remnant of seeking ones. I traveled across the United States in the early years of my ministry, and many were caught by the Lord. That was the first stage of the recovery in the United States, and it lasted for about nine years, from 1962 to 1971. In those years, much of the increase came from my visits to many places and people throughout the United States. Wherever I went, seeking people were caught for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>By 1970 we had over six hundred saints meeting in the church in Los Angeles. In that year we decided to migrate. This migration of the saints to other localities in the United States was victorious. In 1973 we had our summer conference in Los Angeles in the convention center. There were over three thousand there. We had to open up four overflow rooms, and that still could not meet the need. This was the first stage of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to bring in the increase.</p>
<p>In that increase, however, some came in with a heart that was not so pure. They saw the booming work among us, and they came in to try their best to get this work. When they realized they could not get it, they rebelled. That period of time lasted from 1973 to 1978.</p>
<p>During the time that we were booming, our young people were really on fire. Eighty college students set aside half a year just for the purpose of building our meeting hall in Anaheim. Meanwhile, another group of people in Berkeley saw our situation and did not agree with us, so they formed a group to write something against us. They produced a manuscript full of false and defamatory things about us. Later, they were split into two groups. One used this manuscript to write the book called <em>The Mindbenders,</em> and the other group used the same manuscript to write another book called <em>The God-men</em>. These evil writings against us came out in 1977. That began the opposition in the United States. Also in 1977 another group hired someone to come to Anaheim to oppose us. In order to deal with this opposition and proclaim the truth, we put an article in the newspaper every Saturday for three and a half months. We also repeatedly tried to contact the writers and publishers of the two evil, defamatory books against us, but they rejected us.</p>
<p>In 1980 we had a conference in Albuquerque. When the leading brothers met there, one of the co-workers said that if we did not deal with these two books, our work, especially on the campuses, could not be carried on. This was because whenever we contacted a new one, regardless of whether he was a Christian or not, he would receive a copy of these evil books soon afterward. It was in Albuquerque that we made the decision to appeal to our &ldquo;Caesar,&rdquo; just as Paul did to preserve his ministry (Acts 25:11). Our &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; is the law of the United States. Because of our appeal, both of these evil books were exposed, withdrawn, and put down. However, our good name was damaged and our reputation was smeared throughout the whole country. We took five years in litigation to put down those two books and gained the victory in both cases. If we had not taken this action, those two books would have continued to damage us to the uttermost.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we need to realize that the United States is a very worldly country due to its riches. Americans are living in worldliness without any consciousness of it. The whole world follows the worldliness of the United States. Because we are not worldly, others may think we are out of date. Many Americans think that they are the most modern people on this earth. But we do not want to be in this worldly way. In order to dress well, have the best house, and have the best car many try to get a high education so that they can get a high position to make the most money. This is all worldliness.</p>
<p>Of course, the Lord brought His recovery to the United States. My coming here was not up to me. Then when I met all the seeking ones in this country, that surprised me. The Lord collected eight hundred to one thousand real seeking ones for His recovery within just a few years. In those early years, nearly everyone among us was a real seeking one who would pay any price to follow the Lord absolutely for His interest. But we have to realize that worldliness is a big obstacle in the United States.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the truth which we practice concerning the ground of the church&mdash;one church for one city, one city with only one church&mdash;annuls all the standings of the denominations. Thus, what denomination would have anything good to say about us? Under the teaching of the ground of the church, all the divisions, the denominations, are condemned.</p>
<p>Worldliness, the opposition, and the denominations are three layers of obstacles to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States. The United States is the strongest country for Christianity. All the denominations are very strongly founded. Yet we were raised up to stand on the ground of the church, the genuine ground of oneness, which is a testimony against all the denominations.</p>
<p>We may think that it will be easy to gain people for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but it is not easy. We are not in an easy situation. These three layers of obstacles, or three blockades, are here to frustrate us. We need to overcome the worldliness in the United States. Worldliness, the opposition, and the denominations are three blockades to gaining the proper increase in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If this were not the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, with the foundation on the truth and with the condition in life, we would have been brought to nothing already. Despite the blockades, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is still solidly standing here.</p>
<p>In the last five years, beginning in 1987, there has been turmoil caused by certain factious ones who have caused divisions. In spite of this turmoil, the churches in Southern California had an increase of close to thirty percent per year over the last five years. At the beginning of 1987, we had only a little over one thousand saints in Southern California. But by October of 1992, we had increased to about three thousand. The only drawback is that we have had very little increase among the Caucasians during this period of time. With all of this fellowship as a background, we can see how difficult it is for us to gain the typical, middle-aged Caucasians.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING THE PRICE TO BE VITAL</h2>
<p>In light of the present situation we are in, what shall we do? I have studied our situation thoroughly and I feel that nothing can attract and move the present middle-aged American Caucasians unless they see the vitality among us. To be vital means to be living and active. If a group of people are meeting together and are a real vital group&mdash;living and active&mdash;whoever comes in and sees this will be convinced. If we are so vital and some seeking ones come in among us, they will be caught by the Lord. Vitality is the most convincing factor.</p>
<p>If we do not have vital groups, we will have no prevailing way to gain the middle-class Caucasians. If we are vital, sooner or later, in our neighborhood and among our relatives, colleagues, classmates, and friends, we will meet some seeking ones. The seeking ones care for our vitality, for our being living and active.</p>
<p>The truth has an amount of influence with people, but it depends upon who passes on the truth. If you are a vital person, the truth will be effective. If you are not a vital person, others will not be convinced. They will think that you just have some good talk but are really no different than they are. If we bring some new ones to our meeting, and our meeting is dormant, we will not convince them.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we are stressing the vital groups. If we do not have the vital groups, we will still survive as the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We will still exist, but there will not be much hope of getting the typical American increase. The only convincing factor we could have is the vital groups. If we are not vital, we are finished.</p>
<p>Since we love the Lord and we are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, what shall we do? We have to be vital at any cost. We have no choice. We must learn diligently and practice absolutely to be vital; then there is much possibility for us to gain a good number of the seeking ones. These seeking ones caught by us will spread the news. They will say, &ldquo;I am now meeting in a group full of vitality. Come and see.&rdquo; This kind of news will not be appreciated by the general Christians, but some real seeking ones will be attracted. Through this fellowship, I hope we realize where we are and what we need to be.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING CONTACTING THOSE<br />
WHO HAVE BACKSLIDDEN</h2>
<p>Now that we have begun to get into the field of contacting others, there are many lessons for us to learn. We can spend only a certain amount of time to recover the backsliding ones, because we have the sinners and the new ones waiting for our help. When we contact a backsliding one, the first thing we have to learn is how to say something definite and to the point. If a certain brother is backslidden and has been distracted for years, we need to have a thorough fellowship with him to find out where he stands. Then we can give him the appropriate antidote. To give people the proper antidote, we need to learn much. If we talk too much, that would not work. If we talk too little, that is not adequate.</p>
<p>We may spend the next two or three months to contact the other saints among us. Then we need to contact the unbelieving sinners. If we can get a backsliding one recovered, that is wonderful. If we cannot get him recovered, we still should not be disappointed, because we have sown something into him. I want to encourage us to learn something as we endeavor to contact others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>As we contact others, we need to exercise our spirit so that the Spirit may have a way to move on. Quite often, what we speak would not work, but what we express, what we impress people with, is what works. Maybe our words will not influence someone but what we are will. If we have something real and living of the Lord, this will impress people. Quite often, this impression will not work out something right away. Maybe after six months, someone would be brought back to the Lord through the impression which he received of you. There is no need for us to be disappointed, because we are sowing. With any kind of sowing, there is a reaping.</p>
<p>I advise you all to learn to exercise your spirit. Even when some of us share in the meeting, we do not have an impressing spirit. Whenever you speak something in the meetings, you should exercise your spirit. In order to say something concerning the Lord to help people, you need to exercise your spirit. Then the Holy Spirit will move on. If someone is down or discouraged and listens to the speaking of some who are so vital, he will become vitalized.</p>
<p>It is so easy for us to remain in our oldness. What we speak may be good, but it will not be effectual if we do not have our spirit exercised with the Holy Spirit expressed. If we do not exercise our spirit, our sharing cannot be a real spiritual help to others. We must learn to exercise our spirit in everything.</p>
<p>We need to make everything we do definite through our prayer and with our experience of the Spirit. Then we have to match the Spirit with our exercise of our spirit. We need these two things: to experience the Spirit and to match it with the exercise of our spirit. We are all short of this. When we come together in our group meetings, we must exercise our spirit and speak with our spirit.</p>
<p>When you exercise your spirit, you give the Spirit who is indwelling you the way to take action. Then some riches of Christ will come out of you. If you ask certain ones who have a quiet disposition to speak loudly, this will put them on the cross. But if these ones are filled inwardly with the Spirit and experience the outpouring of the Spirit, they will change and become different persons. We should not remain in our oldness and in our old habit. Whenever we function we must exercise our spirit. The Spirit goes along with our voice. If our voice is not released, the Spirit will not be released. Certain quiet and shy ones need to learn to exercise their spirit and their voice so that the Holy Spirit can be expressed.</p>
<p>I want to see your improvement in this matter. I have been improving for over sixty years, and I am still endeavoring to improve. I am not satisfied. I am not content with what I am. I hope that we will all learn to exercise our spirit to make some real progress in our Christian life.</p>
<p>The Christian life actually is just the life of the Spirit. We need the Holy Spirit, and the only way to get into this Holy Spirit is to pray. Only prayer can usher you into the Spirit. When you pray adequately, spontaneously you will have the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit. I encourage you all to pray, not lightly but thoroughly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE GROUP MEETINGS AND<br />
PRAYING FOR OUR WORK OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Each week you need to have a group meeting, and you also need to set aside a day or an evening for the purpose of contacting people. You need these two times weekly. These are additional to the prayer meeting of the church and the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. In our group meeting in these days, we have to pray for our work of contacting people. Then we should fellowship about the situation with our contacts, so that we can study their cases, fellowship about them, and receive the mutual help. After your study, we should pray again. This kind of practice will be very practical, useful, and vital. Then you can decide whom you should contact and by what way. We have to believe that what we are doing by the vital groups will not be in vain, because this is a very practical sowing. Surely there will be the real reaping.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO CLASSIFY PEOPLE FOR GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<p>Accompanying this message, on page 247, is an outline entitled <em>How to Classify People for Gospel Preaching</em>. This publication gives a list of twenty different kinds of people. This was done in 1954 in Taipei when we had a training course for service. In the past I also put out a list of prevailing verses to match the different categories of people. We need to consider the appropriate verses to use when we contact certain people. The twenty categories of people we have classified for gospel preaching are as follows:</p>
	<ol class="decimal">
	<li>Those who live in sins.</li>
	<li>Those who are empty.</li>
	<li>Those who are knowledgeable and rational.</li>
	<li>The moral ones.</li>
	<li>The self-righteous ones.</li>
	<li>The atheists.</li>
	<li>The polytheists.</li>
	<li>Those who are disgusted with the world.</li>
	<li>Lovers of pleasures and vainglory.</li>
	<li>The realists.</li>
	<li>Those who are ambitious and capable of great achievements.</li>
	<li>Lovers of money.</li>
	<li>Lovers of knowledge.</li>
	<li>Lovers of fame, wealth, and position.</li>
	<li>The antagonists.</li>
	<li>The skeptics.</li>
	<li>Those who are sad, pessimistic, and miserable.</li>
	<li>The stubborn ones.</li>
	<li>The churchgoers.</li>
	<li>Those who are indifferent.</li>
	</ol>
<p>The accompanying outline gives basic instructions concerning how to take care of each of these categories of people. I would encourage you to read this, study it, and fellowship with others about it, but do not apply the things in it in a legal way. You have to build up yourself with this kind of practical knowledge. Then when you talk to people, spontaneously you will know how to handle them according to what kind of persons they are.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO PRODUCE AND ESTABLISH<br />
A VITAL GROUP IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Also accompanying this message, on page 253, is an outline entitled <em>How to Produce and Establish a Vital Group in the Church Life</em>. I hope that we will read and study this outline prayerfully so that we can be made vital and go to vitalize others.</p><h1 class="title">HOW TO CLASSIFY PEOPLE<br />
FOR GOSPEL PREACHING</h1>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Those who live in sins.</li>
<li>Those who are empty.</li>
<li>Those who are knowledgeable and rational.</li>
<li>The moral ones.</li>
<li>The self-righteous ones.</li>
<li>The atheists.</li>
<li>The polytheists.</li>
<li>Those who are disgusted with the world.</li>

<li>Those who are sad, pessimistic, and miserable.</li>
<li>The stubborn ones.</li>
<li>The churchgoers.</li>
<li>Those who are indifferent.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>With one who lives in sins:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>With one who does not yet sense his sinfulness:
		<ol class="none">
		<li>(1) Touch the misery of sinning and his conscience to make him conscious of his sins; however, avoid overdoing it lest he become disgusted.</li>
		<li>(2) Exercise your wisdom not to make him feel that you are condemning him.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>With one who senses his sinfulness but cannot save himself:
		<ol class="none">
		<li>(1) In principle, try to increase his feeling concerning sins.</li>
		<li>(2) Help him to sense the misery of sin.</li>
		<li>(3) Make him aware of the charge of sin against him before God and make him sense the weight of it.</li>
		<li>(4) Make him know that the issue of committing sins is death and that the more sins one commits, the sooner one dies; moreover, there is judgment after death.</li>
		<li>(5) Lead him to know the Lord&rsquo;s redemption and deliverance.</li>
		<li>(6) Do not point out too many ways of getting saved; rather, simply lead him to touch the Lord and receive Him by opening his mouth to pray.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is empty:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Do not try to touch his feelings in the same way as you would with one in the first category.</li>
	<li>Do not refer to his background. For example, with one who has a certain addiction, do not say anything about that particular addiction; with one who lost her husband, do not mention anything concerning &ldquo;husband.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Let him know that God is the contents of man and the meaning of human life and that man feels empty because man is without God.</li>
	<li>Lead him to see that the way for man to have satisfaction is for him to gain God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is knowledgeable and rational:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Absolutely refrain from talking about knowledge (since this category of people enjoys talking about knowledge). Make him feel as if you are not knowledgeable.</li>
	<li>Do not directly point out his lack.</li>
	<li>Deal with his knowledge by giving real testimonies, such as the joy of salvation, peace, and freedom, to make him sense that his knowledge is almost like a theory, without practical usefulness, thus causing him to sense his real need.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is moral:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Praise morality first.</li>
	<li>Make him feel that his morality is inadequate.</li>
	<li>Make him know that only the highest life can produce the highest morality. Use Romans 7 to show him that without the highest life, one has only the will but not the power to do good.</li>
	<li>Tell him that Christ is able to be man&rsquo;s highest life and thus create in him a heart that desires Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is self-righteous:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Begin your talk with God, just as God dealt with Job.</li>
	<li>Make him see God&rsquo;s greatness, excellence, extensiveness.</li>
	<li>Present to him God&rsquo;s required standard and the Lord&rsquo;s human living so that he can measure himself by them.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With an atheist:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Do not debate concerning the existence of God; rather, touch his feeling because that which is known of God is manifest within man (Rom. 1:19). Even the strongest atheist has questions deep down in his heart concerning atheism.</li>
	<li>Also touch his conscience. The feeling of the conscience is the sense of morality, and the source of morality is God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With a polytheist:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Do not refute him in theory; rather, give him facts to show him the result of worshipping many gods.</li>
	<li>Make him see that &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; is the most orthodox thing in the universe, such as one father and one mother, one husband and one wife, one chief of state, one sun; hence, there can be only one God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is disgusted with the world:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Do not scare him with hell, but make him see how God dearly loves him. He is the one lost sheep out of the hundred. Tell him the three parables in Luke 15.</li>
	<li>Make him know that God cannot do without him and that God has predestinated him to have the best blessings.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who loves pleasures and vainglory:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Make him know that he has the need of God within him and that he falls into seeking pleasures and the things of vainglory because he fails to find God.</li>
	<li>Show him God&rsquo;s loveliness and the real joy and real glory in God. When he sees what is the best, he will give up what is next to the best.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With a realist:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Make him see that only a man who possesses the Lord is a true realist because only the Lord is the true reality.</li>
	<li>Then by sharing with him the testimonies and life of the saved ones, make him see that only by being saved can he have the reality.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is ambitious and capable of great achievements:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>First praise him a little.</li>
	<li>Lead him to see that human strength is limited, and use Philippians 2:13 to show him that only the Lord is truly the power that causes man to have the will and the capability for great achievements.</li>
	<li>God created man that man may have achievements. However, it is only by having the life of God that man can truly have achievements and a worthy human life.</li>

<li>With one who loves money:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>To a rich man who is critically ill you may use Matthew 16:26 to increase his sense concerning the inadequacy of money.</li>
	<li>To a rich man enjoying peace and ease you may speak something by way of hinting in order to give him the sense that there are things that money cannot do, though it is considered to be all-powerful. Show him by intimation that money cannot buy peace, life, or God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who loves knowledge:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Find out first his motive for learning.</li>
	<li>To one who considers learning as a preference, make him see that God is more preferable than learning and most suitable to man&rsquo;s taste.</li>
	<li>To one who acquires learning in order to solve the problems of human life and to seek out the prospects of human life, make him see that the prospects of human life are hinged on God and that God is the highest prospect of the human life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who loves fame, wealth, and position:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Deal with him as you would with one who is a lover of pleasures and vainglory.</li>
	<li>Make him see that although the world is lovable, there is One who is more lovable. Set before him God and all that God desires to give to man, and let him make a comparison between God and all that is of the world.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is antagonistic:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Ignore his antagonism; rather, deal with him by presenting facts.</li>
	<li>If his antagonism is due to his misunderstanding about the church, you may give a little explanation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is a skeptic:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Make him know that his problem is with his mind. Although in his mind he doubts about the Lord Jesus, in his heart he senses the need of the Lord.</li>
	<li>Help him to get out of the doubting in his mind and to take care of the feeling in his heart.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is sad, pessimistic, and miserable:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Introduce the Lord to him that he may know that all the miseries of human life are due to the absence of God.</li>
	<li>Let him know that only God can solve his problems.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is stubborn:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>You may deal with him only in a gentle way.</li>
	<li>Do not argue by reasoning with him, because it will only cause him to be more stubborn. Rather, show him the love of God because God&rsquo;s love is gentle yet powerful.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With a churchgoer:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Let him know that the salvation of the Lord is not merely an empty doctrine, but that it is practical and can enable him to receive the Lord&rsquo;s life. Therefore, he must seek to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s life and not merely listen to sermons. (Do not be too explicit about this.)</li>
	<li>Lead him to contact and receive the Lord by exercising his spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>With one who is indifferent:
	<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li>Create in him a need and make him conscious of it.</li>
	<li>Lead him to contact the Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>

A VITAL GROUP IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>By one saint to be made vital&mdash;living and active:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through the absolute, clear, and thorough fellowship with the Lord continuously.</li>
	<li>Through the thorough confession of sins, transgressions, failures, defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, etc., hidden or manifested, before God and before men.</li>
	<li>Through the absolute and thorough consecration of oneself with everything to the Lord.</li>
	<li>Through the unceasing and desperate prayer.</li>
	<li>Through the soaking of the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By contacting another seeking saint:

	<li>To fellowship with him or her according to the above procedures.</li>
	<li>To make him or her vital and join with you as a group.</li>
	<li>Both of you continuing to contact other seeking saints and making them vital to join with you and to increase your group.</li>
	<li>Until your group reaches about ten, dividing it into two groups, and instructing each of the two groups to do the same thing as you have done with them.</li>
