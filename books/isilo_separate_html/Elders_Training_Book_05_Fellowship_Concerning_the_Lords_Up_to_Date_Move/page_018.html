UPON THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I believe that in the long run the Lord will gain something. It is not only a matter of us gaining something. It must be that the Lord will gain what He desires. He needs a church that matches His standard. The Lord said that He would build His church &ldquo;on this rock&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). Brother Nee pointed out that this rock does not only mean Christ Himself. This rock is the revelation concerning Christ. Peter saw that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God. The church will be built upon such a revelation. To say that Christ is the rock is easy, but to say that the revelation of Christ is the rock requires much study of the revelation.</p>
<p>Every denomination claims that their foundation is Christ, that Christ is the rock upon which they build their denomination. The Catholic church claims the same thing. But do they know anything about the revelation of Christ? The revelation of Christ is altogether developed, explained, and presented from Matthew to Revelation. The entire New Testament is the revelation of Christ. For Christ to build up His church we need to know the entire New Testament as the revelation of Christ. Today there is a shallow gospel with a shallow revelation of Christ telling a person that he is a sinner, that God loves him, and that God gave His Son for him. God&rsquo;s Son came to be the Savior who died on the cross, resurrected, and is now in the heavens. He loves all men. If a person believes in Him, he will be saved and when he dies he will go to heaven. Since he has been saved, he has to be good, improve his character, and glorify God. Christ cannot build the church upon such a shallow revelation of Himself. We have been laboring in the United States for twenty-three years, trying the best to uplift the situation. I really suffer in my spirit to see the saints brought down to something shallow and elementary.</p>
<p>The Lord has released so many truths among us which are mostly in print. I believe that with us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery something has really been sown into our being. I have the full assurance that some day what the Lord has been sowing in these twenty-three years in the United States will come out. If not in this century, then in the next century it will surely come out. What Paul did in his day did not come out at his own time, but eventually we are here enjoying the issue of his labor. Without Paul&rsquo;s labor, what could we say and what could we see? What Paul saw is here not only in the Spirit but also in the Word. Without His fourteen Epistles, what could we know? Without his fourteen Epistles, how could we have the completion of God&rsquo;s divine revelation (Col. 1:25)?</p>
<p>I believe that what the Lord has been doing in these past twenty-three years could never be in vain, but I am still human, hoping to see the result. Sometimes when I see something otherwise, my heart and my spirit surely suffer. If what we have done is something on the sinking sand, it will go away. But what we have built on the revelation of Christ is on the rock. The rock in Matthew 7 is the same as the rock in Matthew 16. At the end of Matthew 7 the Lord says that whatever is done according to His word is built on a rock (vv. 24-25). That rock is the revelation because that rock is the word. The rock is not just the Person of Christ directly, but the revelation of this Person. This is why the churches are also built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, that is, upon their teaching (Eph. 2:20). Their teaching is the revelation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUBLISH OR PERISH</h2>
<p>To be a professor in a top university you must publish something. In the top educational circles there is a slogan among the professors&mdash;&ldquo;either publish or perish.&rdquo; To be a professor at a top university requires a great amount of labor. These words apply to the elders&mdash;&ldquo;publish or perish.&rdquo; First you must learn something and then you can &ldquo;publish.&rdquo; Before all the saints can be helped to speak, you have to be able to speak. If you do not take the initiative, who can start something? Our way is not the easy way, or the short-cut way. The God-ordained way is the way of life. You cannot expect a baby born yesterday to be a good speaker after a week. You have to raise him up. This takes at least eighteen years. If the physical life takes time for growth and development, how could we expect the spiritual life to be fully grown overnight? How many among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have had a spiritual graduation? We must change our way at a cost, but to do so the elders must labor. If you do not labor to &ldquo;publish,&rdquo; you will &ldquo;perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have seen that the Christian way of meeting is talked about in Acts and 1 Corinthians. In Acts are the small home meetings. In 1 Corinthians is the meeting of the whole church. In both kinds of meetings, mutuality and speaking must be there. For mutuality and speaking to be the reality in the local churches, there is the need of a great amount of labor on the part of all the leading ones.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
