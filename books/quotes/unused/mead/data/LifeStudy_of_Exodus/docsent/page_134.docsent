   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY THE LIVING WATER OUT OF THE SMITTEN ROCK 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 17:1-7; Num 20:1-13; 1 Cor 10:1-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having already covered the heavenly manna in chapter sixteen, we come in this message to the living water out of the smitten rock 17:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MANNA AND THE LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to pay attention to the sequence of events in chapters sixteen and seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter sixteen we have a clear picture of manna, and in chapter seventeen, the record of the living water flowing out of the smitten rock.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This sequence is not accidental; it is according to the Lord s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same sequence is found in John 6 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 6 we read of the heavenly manna, and in John 7, of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a further indication that the sequence of the manna and the living water is according to God s sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His work of creation God prepared the rock spoken of in Exodus 17 and placed it in exactly the right spot geographically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the children of Israel came to that place, the rock was waiting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter seventeen we are not told that Moses was commanded to look for a rock or to bring a rock to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, there is the clear indication that the rock was already there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as God had prepared the Red Sea to serve as a baptistry for the children of Israel, so He had prepared a rock, probably a very large one, to serve as a type of Christ in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After God created man, He placed him in a garden with the tree of life and a flowing river.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tree of life corresponds to manna, which satisfies man s hunger, and the flowing river corresponds to the living water, which quenches man s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 2 the tree of life is mentioned before the river.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in Revelation 22, the river of water of life is mentioned before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the tree of life grows in the river.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why does Genesis speak first of the tree of life and then of the river, whereas in Revelation 22 the order is reversed?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the beginning stage the tree of life is followed by the river, but in the ongoing stage the tree of life grows in the flowing river.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a picture of our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we first heard the gospel, we received God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To receive the word is to receive manna.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After we received the word, the Spirit began to flow in us like a river.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the sequence at the beginning of the experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now as we go on in spiritual experience, the Spirit as a flowing river brings us the supply of the word, the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of our Christian experience we have first the word and then the Spirit, first the manna and then the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But as our experience of salvation continues, the order is changed, and the Spirit supplies us with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Psalm 36:8 says, They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This verse refers to the initial stage of the experience of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the fatness of God s house the word precedes the drinking of the river of God s pleasures the Spirit .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is significant that the children of Israel had the experience of living water recorded in chapter seventeen after they had begun to eat manna.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Immediately after they began to partake of manna, they were led to a place where there was no supply of water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Far from being accidental, this sequence of events took place according to God s sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This sequence is part of the accurate and complete picture of God s full salvation presented in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have pointed out again and again, Exodus is a book of pictures portraying God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we consider these pictures, we need to worship God for His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His creation He made the necessary preparations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, at the proper time, He led His people into the place where the rock was waiting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>FOLLOWING THE LORD S LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 17:1 we read that the children of Israel journeyed according to the commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They did not travel according to their own opinion or choice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The commandment of the Lord was no doubt related to the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, by which the people were led in their journeys.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The pillar signifies the Lord Himself, who took the lead and guided the people on their way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was no need for God to tell the people when to move or where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They simply had to follow the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day and night, a tall pillar stood between heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By day the pillar had the appearance of a cloud; by night it had the appearance of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 13:22 we are told that the Lord took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to Numbers 9:17 and 18, when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they pitched Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that the commandment of the Lord is related to the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever the pillar moved, either by day or by night, the children of Israel journeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, through the pillar God silently commanded the people concerning their travels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In leaving the place where they first ate manna, the children of Israel simply followed the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They did not move according to their preference, and they did not know where they were going.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They just followed the pillar as it led them to a dry place, a place where there was no supply of water, but where there was a huge rock.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here in this place God s people were to experience His salvation.</S>
