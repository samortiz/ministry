   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Greatest Obstacle to Prayer Being Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer is a test; it exposes your spiritual condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If your spiritual condition is proper and normal, others will be saved one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As you intercede continuously before the Lord, you may find one or two persons saved after a few days or half a month.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a while, another three or five may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People should be saved regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If your prayers are not answered for a long time, it must mean that you are sick before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should go to the Lord for light and find out where your problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The greatest obstacle to prayer is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must learn to live a holy life before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must reject all known sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The moment we take sin lightly or tolerate it, our prayers will be hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin has both an objective aspect and a subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The objective aspect has to do with God, while the subjective aspect has to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the objective side, sin obstructs God's grace and promises.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save;/Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear./But your iniquities have become a separation/Between you and your God,/And your sins have hidden His face/From you so that He does not hear."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 66:18 says, "If I regard iniquity in my heart,/The Lord will not hear."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a person does not take care of the problem of sin properly, he will find hindrance to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unconfessed sins, sins which are never dealt with by the blood, are a big obstacle before God; they are the cause of unanswered prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is on the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the subjective side, sin damages man's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a person sins, no matter what he says to himself, how much he reads the Bible, how many promises there are in the Word, how much grace God has, and how much He accepts him, his conscience will be weakened and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Timothy 1:19 says, "Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A ship may be old or small, but it cannot leak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Similarly, our conscience must not have a leak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As soon as the conscience is not at peace, many prayers cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, there are obstacles not only before God but even within man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The relationship between faith and conscience is just like that between a ship and its cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Faith is like the cargo, and the conscience is like a ship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the ship has a leak, the cargo will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the conscience is strong, faith will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when there is a leak in the conscience, faith will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our heart blames us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things 1 John 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you want to be a man of prayer, you must deal with sin thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You lived in sin for a long time in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are not careful with it now, you will not be totally free from it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to deal with sin seriously; you have to come before God to confess every sin, putting every sin under the blood, refusing it, and coming out from it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then your conscience will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as the blood cleanses, the conscience is recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There will be no condemnation, and spontaneously you will see God's face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Never give in to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will weaken you before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are weak before the Lord, you will not be able to intercede for others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as sin remains, you will not be able to utter anything in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sin is the number one problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You should pay attention to it all the time, even daily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If one deals with sin properly before the Lord, he will be able to offer proper prayers, and others will be brought to the Lord through him.</S>
