   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The record in the book of Daniel is very detailed in regard to the desolation caused by Antichrist see Dan 11:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The holy covenant refers to the Ten Commandments, which is the covenant between God and the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who break the covenant are the rebellious Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Daniel 9:27 says, "He will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Daniel 12:11 mentions "a thousand two hundred and ninety days," which is one month in excess of the one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This one-month period refers to the judgment of the sheep and the goats after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 refers to the appearing of Antichrist, and verse 9 indicates that the Antichrist can perform signs and wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Revelation 13:3-6 and 11-15 there are two beasts: Antichrist and the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sea Rev 13:1 refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The earth Rev 13:11 refers to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, after the resuscitation of Antichrist, the false prophet will make an image of him and will cause people to worship it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This image will be the one put into the temple; "let him who reads understand."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord added this word because Antichrist, the abomination of desolation, the holy place, and similar things are very much misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This also indicates that Matthew 24 must be read along with the books of Daniel and other prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people say that Matthew 24:15 refers to the situation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is unlikely because the Lord mentions Daniel, and the prophets in the Old Testament would not prophesy concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others say that this refers to the desolation of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This also is not accurate, because Daniel's prophecies regarding the resurrection from the dead, the cleansing of the temple, the understanding of the wise, etc. were not fulfilled at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 24:15-31 has not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although Luke 21:20-28 is somewhat similar, many of the prophecies there were fulfilled during the battle led by Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke and Matthew have different purposes: the former pays attention to the destruction of Jerusalem, whereas the latter emphasizes the desolation of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Daniel emphasizes the destruction of the temple also; therefore, Matthew quoted from it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luke did not emphasize the matters concerning the very end of the age; he merely said that all these were near the end. What is revealed in the book of Luke was fulfilled at the time of Titus and will also be fulfilled in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible there is often a principle concerning prophecy: first there is a partial fulfillment, and later there is the complete fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the time of Titus, all the believers, even those with the least faith, escaped to the foot of the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke 21:22 the word "all" is an important word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the time of Titus's destruction, not "all" things were fulfilled, but only a portion of them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 24 "fall by the edge of the sword" and "led captive" have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, today the land of the Jews, Israel, still remains in the hands of the Gentiles, and it is still "the times of the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But these times will soon be over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 25 the signs in the sun, moon, and stars refer to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are two expressions for the end of the age: 1 the great tribulation and 2 the hour of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The former refers to the Jews Dan 12:1 and Matt 24:21; Daniel is clearly speaking to the Jews , and the latter refers to the Gentiles Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The center of the coming great tribulation is Jerusalem, and the circumference is the Jewish nation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As to the hour of trial, the center is Rome, and the circumference is the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Revelation 16:10 the throne of the beast and his kingdom refer to the recovered Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of the age the great tribulation and the great trial will center, respectively, in Jerusalem and in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these places the tribulation and the trial will be the most severe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the circumference, for the nation of the Jews and for the inhabited earth, the situation will be less severe see diagram .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we read Matthew 24, we need to pay attention to Matthew 23:38, which says, "Behold, your house is left to you desolate."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning the Jewish nation, the Lord clearly announced that He had rejected it although individuals can still be accepted .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, Matthew 24 speaks concerning the Jews as a nation but does not address the Jews as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord spoke the prophecy to the disciples, He was regarding them not as representatives of the Jewish nation but as disciples who had two standings: 1 they were the Jewish remnant loyal to the Messiah, believing that the Lord was the Messiah, and 2 as members of the church, the disciples were also the pillars of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, Matthew 24 as a whole is definitely not addressed to the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Each of the disciples had two standings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They cannot represent only the church and not the Jewish remnant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we must clearly define which part of Matthew 24 refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 31 is the dividing line.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us look again at the questions of the disciples: 1 What are the signs of the coming of these things?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2 What are the signs of His coming?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3 What are the signs of the consummation of the age?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What were the disciples referring to when they asked concerning the Lord's coming and the consummation of the age?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their understanding then and ours now are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Originally, in the minds of the disciples there was no concept of the church; there was only the thought of the kingdom of Israel see Acts 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even after the coming of the Holy Spirit, the disciples still would not leave Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peter was reluctant to go to Cornelius's house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After he went, the rest of the brothers contended with Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the beginning Peter did not know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What did the term "consummation of the age" mean to them?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It meant the end of the age in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reigning of Messiah would be after "the consummation of the age"; therefore, the consummation of the age to them was the age before the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They did not know; therefore, they asked.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even though they were mistaken, the Lord did not answer in a mistaken way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Ignorance cannot stop the answer of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Most of the prophecy given on the mount was related to the church.</S>
