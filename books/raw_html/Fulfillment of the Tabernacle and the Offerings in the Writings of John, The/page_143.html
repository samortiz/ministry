<h2 class=head2>To Release the Divine Life</h2><p>John 12:24 indicates that the Lord’s going, His death on the cross, was for the releasing of the divine life: “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” According to this verse, when the Lord was crucified, He fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat in order to produce many grains. Here we see that the Lord died to release the divine life. Hence, His going was not only to take care of things on the negative side—to solve the problem of sin, terminate the old creation, judge the world, destroy Satan, and abolish the ordinances—but also to do something very positive—to release the divine life that was concealed within Him.<p>We need to see all that is signified by the sign of the Lord’s going. This sign includes the taking away of sin, the termination of the old creation, the judgment of the world, the destroying of Satan, the abolishing of the law of the commandments and ordinances, and the releasing of the divine life. What a wonderful sign! Not only did the disciples fail to understand this, but many of today’s Christians do not understand it either, even though it has been recorded in the Bible. How many believers realize that the Lord’s going was a sign of His all-inclusive death? It truly is a great matter that the problem of sin has been solved, that the old creation has been terminated, that the world has been judged, that Satan and his works have been destroyed, and that the law of commandments and ordinances has been abolished. It is also a great matter that through the Lord’s death the divine life has been released.<h2 class=head2>To Prepare a Place for His Believers to Enter into God</h2><p>Although we have covered many wonderful aspects of the Lord’s going, we need to cover one further aspect: preparing a place for His believers to enter into God. A great purpose of the Lord’s going was to prepare a place for His believers to enter into God (John 14:2-3). Through His death, the Lord opened the way for sinners to come into God. The way He prepared through His going is the new and living way mentioned in Hebrews 10:19-20: “Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.” A living entry into the Triune God has been prepared by the Lord’s going. This is what the Lord meant when He said, “I go to prepare a place for you…that where I am you also may be” (John 14:2-3). The Lord is in the Father. However, before the Lord’s going through death, the disciples were still outside the Father. Hence, they were not in the place where the Lord is. Before the Son’s going, there was no way, no entry, for us sinners to come into the Father.<p>What we have in John 14:2 and 3 is not yet the building of the Father’s house; this is the way, the entry, into the building. After we enter into the Father, we receive His dispensing. Now that we are in Him, the Father dispenses His nature into our being. The Father’s nature is signified by gold (Rev. 21:18b, 21b). We also have the dispensing of the Son with His overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection signified by pearl (Rev. 21:21). Furthermore, we have the dispensing of the Spirit into our being, mainly for the purpose of transforming us and making us precious stones (Rev. 21:19-20). This dispensing of the Triune God with the Father’s nature, the Son’s death and resurrection, and the Spirit’s transforming work is all for the building of the Father’s house.<p>The crucial point here is that apart from the Son’s going we would have no way to come into the Father. Without the Lord’s going, sinners cannot enter into the holy God. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord to go. Now we can praise Him for going and for doing everything signified by the sign of His going. Now there is a clear way for us to come into the Father. We can come boldly into the Father, and we are in Him now to enjoy His dispensing. This is the sign of the Lord’s going.
