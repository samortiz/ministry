Today many believers are possessed by demons, though the degree of possession may be different. However, they do not realize that they are possessed. They consider their strange and unusual experiences as "natural" and as either from their "self" or from sin. They explain their experiences in this way because these experiences do not outwardly look like they are from evil spirits.</P><P>There is a law in everything that God has created. This means that every activity follows a definite pattern. There is also a pattern in the work of evil spirits. For every cause, there is an effect. If any man fulfills the condition for evil spirits to work (whether this person purposely fulfills it, as witches, necromancers, or those who practice planchette do, or unintentionally fulfills it, as Christians may do), they will definitely work on this person. We should realize that there is a law to all the activities of evil spirits. As long as a person fulfills the condition required by the law, he will immediately experience the activities of evil spirits. This is a law of cause and effect. Fire will burn a person, water will drown a person; these are laws. No one has ever put himself into a fire without getting burned, and no one has ever submerged himself into water without getting drowned. It is the same with regard to the work of evil spirits. As long as one fulfills the condition that evil spirits need to attach to him, they will attach themselves to him. Once there is a cause, there must be an effect. It does not matter if you are a Christian or not; if you fulfill the condition for evil spirits to work, they will work. Evil spirits attach themselves to all those who fulfill the condition for their work. Hence, a Christian is not spared from this danger just because he is a Christian. A Christian cannot put himself into fire to be burned or into water to be drowned and say that he will not be injured or killed because he is a Christian. Similarly, he cannot fulfill the condition for evil spirits to work and say that he will not be possessed by demons because he is a Christian. Fire burns everyone who puts himself into it; water drowns everyone who puts himself into it. Likewise, evil spirits attach themselves to everyone who gives them the ground. It does not matter whether or not he is a Christian.</P><P>For this reason, if a believer gives evil spirits the opportunity to work, they certainly will not give up; rather, they will take the opportunity to attach themselves to the believer.</P><P>What is the condition for evil spirits to attach themselves to man? What must man do before he will be possessed by evil spirits? What condition does he have to meet before evil spirits will work? This is the most crucial question. The Bible calls this condition the "place" (Eph. 4:27). This "place" or "room" is the empty spot left in man for evil spirits. This place is the footing that evil spirits can gain in man. Evil spirits attach themselves to man according to the place they are given. The amount of place they are given is the degree to which they attach themselves to man. Whether this place is given by a heathen or by a Christian, demons will attach themselves to that person just the same. Whatever in man allows evil spirits a spot to attack, an opportunity to invade, a footing to stand on, can be called a "place." If a man gives place to evil spirits, he cannot help but be possessed by them. Since there is a cause, there must be an effect. If a believer gives place to evil spirits, relying on the notion that he will not be possessed because he is a Christian, he has already been deeply deceived by evil spirits.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_296.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_298.html">Next</a> </body></html>
