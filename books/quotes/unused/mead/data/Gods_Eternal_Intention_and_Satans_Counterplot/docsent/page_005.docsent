   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GLOVE AND THE HAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's love, however, is not the real love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Human love is like a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A glove has the likeness of a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why is a glove made in this form?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is so that a real hand may get into it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The glove is intended to be the container of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Human love is only the container for the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is true of all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When there are gloves without hands, the gloves are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gloves are not made for themselves; they are made for the hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human virtues are gloves; the divine virtues are the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need love, but our love is merely a container.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The real love as the contents is the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we love someone by our own love, without having God's love in it, our love is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the teachings of Confucius the goal is to develop the created human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I used to preach the gospel in China, I would tell my hearers that they had only the glove without the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now I was presenting the hand to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who was the hand?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Confucius, for example, taught submission; a woman was to submit herself first to her father, then to her husband, and then to her son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This submission, I said, is a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we may be able to succeed in it, but such submission is empty and false.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We appear to submit, but actually we are gritting our teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now I offer you the hand to fill your empty glove.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the real submission!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not mean that Christians should have no regard for morality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our behavior should be of the highest moral standard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have not only the glove but also the hand!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our morality is higher and more practical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Jesus Christ was living on this earth, His ethics were the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whose ethics can exceed those of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are the ethics we are living today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have not only the glove, but the hand in the glove!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Surely the ethics or morality in the local churches exceed the common practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>REPENTING OF THE GOOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our daily life, however, all too often we do not have this realization of the distinction between the hand and the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times these past few years I have had to make confession, not of my failures or my hatred, but of my love or my kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times I have loved without the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have loved as an elderly, experienced man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is no longer easy for me to be irritated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was young and inexperienced, my temper could easily flare up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now that I am close to eighty, the fire is quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am not easily provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is easy for me to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How I have come to hate my goodness!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have had to confess to the Lord, "Today from morning till evening I have been good to everyone without You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have given message after message to the saints, charging them to live You, yet I myself have been a failure nearly the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have not lived You.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have lived myself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have lived an elderly, experienced man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Forgive me, Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My younger brother has been here for many months now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He himself will agree that whenever he has come to see me, I have always treated him in a kindly way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nonetheless, I have had to tell the Lord that I did not live Christ to my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since he came, I believe he has not gained much Christ through me; I have ministered very little Christ to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have treated him well and done many kind things for him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet I have repented to the Lord, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May Your blood cleanse me that I have not lived You to my brother."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In your daily realization you have no sense of how naturally good you are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you tell a lie to a brother, your conscience will immediately prick you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How could you have lied to a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may never have lied to a brother; you have done only good to him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Have you ever repented of the good you have done to a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you receive the mercy to repent of doing good to others, you are very much graced by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>BORN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It would be helpful to pray-read the verses listed at the beginning of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>John 1:12-13 tells us that we have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are born of someone, we surely have that one's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since we have been born of God, surely we have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not to say that we are objects of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not the Godhead; only the Godhead is to be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are the children of God, and we are like Him because we have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God has been born into us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How marvelous this is!</S>
