   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIS OF JUDGMENT LOVING THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is one basic condition for knowing men's problems or diagnosing their illnesses: We must understand that the purpose of our discernment and judgment is not for checking others out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A proper Christian should not desire to know about others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only abnormal Christians would want to pry into others' business.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we need to know the condition of the brothers, we are not motivated by curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not be curious about their affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are forced to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other than for the purpose of serving and helping them, we should not want to know much about others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are busy enough ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have no time to pry into the affairs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a man always tries to know about others and pries into their business, he is a big problem in himself; he is the first one who needs healing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we have learned on this mountain is for the purpose of ministering Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not here to criticize or to find fault.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We try to know men for the purpose of serving and helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I know that the Lord has put a certain brother into my hand, it is because He wants me to know him and help him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason I am doing what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unless the Holy Spirit has arranged this contact, I do not want to know about anything concerning my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that none of you will have a craving for knowing others' business.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not wish for anyone to examine the affairs of others and to turn them into conversation pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not take up anyone's burden lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must not have any intention in knowing men other than for the purpose of helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Communication among God's children is based on love, not on knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not communicate with our brothers and sisters according to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we should fellowship according to love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The basis of Christian fellowship is always love, never knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The world seeks like-minded people in its fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But our fellowship is based on our love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our fellowship were based on our knowledge, it would be difficult for us to be Christians at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has not communicated with us according to His knowledge of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we communicate with the brothers and sisters according to our knowledge of them, the Lord will not entrust us with the knowledge of our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more we know about men, the harder it will be for us to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we try to know others according to knowledge, we will shake our head about everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will shake our head about this brother and that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the end, I am afraid that we would not be able to fellowship with anyone, and we would even shake our head about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our communication and fellowship with the brothers can only be built on the foundation of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know the brothers for the sake of rendering help and service to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We try to know the condition of a person only as we work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our love for the brothers must be separated from our knowledge of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God can only commit Himself to those servants who are able to separate love from knowledge and who can deal with people accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who cannot separate these two things are not qualified to be a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I should speak a word of advance warning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we mix these two matters together, we have to take responsibility for the mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There should even be a distinction between love and knowledge in the way we deal with our sons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A father must know what problems his son has, but no father will lose his love for his son just because he has gained knowledge of his troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The communication between the father and the son is based on love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Love is "foolish."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The father's knowledge of his son cannot influence his love towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot love our brothers less than we love our son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In fellowshipping with our brothers, we have to act as if we are completely ignorant of their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to fellowship by love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We love the brothers, and our fellowship with them can only be in love, not by knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should act as if we do not know anything about our brothers' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our communication with the brothers and sisters must always be based on love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us take another illustration from God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way the Lord Jesus dealt with Judas is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Judas was a thief; he always stole money from the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was a greedy man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the Lord dealt with the twelve disciples according to knowledge, He surely would not have asked Judas to keep the money.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord was not ignorant of Judas's stealing, yet He still asked him to take charge of the money.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He dealt with Judas just as He dealt with the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>During the three years of His ministry, the Lord did not indicate in any way that He knew Judas was a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even on the day of Judas's betrayal, He did not expose him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Up until the time when they last broke bread together, the disciples did not find anything unusual about Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's relationship with the twelve disciples before the cross was not a relationship of the Head with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>While He was on earth, the Lord was managing the Father's possessions in the capacity of the Son Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The disciples were the Father's possessions; they were not the Father's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord did not know them as sons but as possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This knowledge was outward.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The disciples' relationship with the Lord was not one of the Body with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They were not members of the church relating to the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord seemingly tolerated Judas because as the Son, the Lord managed and administered God's household according to outward rule.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the reason He never exposed Judas's stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we judged this according to our knowledge, we would call this a political, not a Christian, move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A man in the world becomes wise and experienced when he reaches fifty; he no longer does anything foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He becomes shrewd and cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He never falls prey to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But this is the way of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No Christian should become shrewd and cunning through the knowledge he has gained of other men.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we deal with the brothers and sisters according to knowledge, we can spare ourselves many crosses and headaches by relying on our shrewdness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today our knowledge about the brothers and sisters is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After a few years, this knowledge will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we will know the brothers as soon as we talk with them, and it will be hard for us to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Yet this should not happen among us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we deal with the brothers according to knowledge, we will become shrewd and cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not growth, but degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must keep ourselves in the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord gives us knowledge of the brothers for the purpose of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Those in the world cannot love after they have been fooled by others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They become afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But Christians should not be this way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Among Christians, love is at the very top.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Love reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should never become clever by gaining knowledge of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we know men merely to avoid being fooled by them, our knowledge will only make us clever men.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If this is the meaning of being clever, then our Lord was the most foolish man.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Judas's stealing was a chance to manifest the Lord's glory and greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Men's eyes usually are blinded when others steal from them.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But the Lord's eyes were open when others stole from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The commandment that the Lord received from the Father was that Judas should keep the money.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If the Lord had asked Peter to keep the money, the money might have been spent quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If He had asked Matthew to keep the money, there might not have been enough to pay the food bill.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Others could have stolen more.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Judas could have complained that the loss could have been greater had the money been entrusted to others.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>One tends to accuse others of doing the same thing that he is guilty of.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If someone else had been entrusted with the money, the purse might have been more tightly controlled, but the mouths would not have been controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>At a minimum Judas would have opened his mouth to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Lord asked Judas to keep the money.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Although he stole some of it, he kept it secret.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The most that occurred was that money was stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If others had been given charge of the money, more problems could have arisen.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May God give us a greater love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have to pray that God would make our love for the brothers greater than our knowledge of them.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>May our love for the brothers transcend everything.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>May our cleverness not affect our love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>May we know men for the purpose of helping them, not for the purpose of avoiding trouble on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We ask God to fill our hearts with love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We should act as if we do not know anything about their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is something that belongs to another world.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The more we know the brothers, the narrower our pathway becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We should not be afraid of being taken advantage of or suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We should allow love to transcend everything, and brotherly love is the only way.</S>
