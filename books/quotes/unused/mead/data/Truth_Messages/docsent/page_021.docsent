   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we are in the Triune God, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we are in ourselves, however, we are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outward teachings concerning oneness do not make us one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more today s Christians talk about oneness, the more divided they are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Like the Corinthians, they are still in themselves; hence, they are through with the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have pointed out that in John 14 the Lord Jesus said that He was going to prepare a place for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This place is God the Father Himself, and the way there is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 14:6 the Lord said, I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. Christ, the Son, is the way, and the Father is the place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although unbelievers can lodge only in themselves, we have a choice between dwelling in ourselves and dwelling in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not need to remain in ourselves; we can move into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A place has been prepared for us, and a choice is presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said that after He prepared a place for us in the Father s house, He would come to receive us into that place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, where He is, we may be also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord is in the Father, and He desires that we too be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now that the place has been prepared for us in the Father, we can move into Him by being sanctified through the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This involves both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we continually touch the Word and allow the Spirit to touch us day by day, we shall be sanctified; that is, we shall move out of ourselves, our old lodging place, and into the Triune God, our new lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By making this move, worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion are left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>PERFECTED INTO ONE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 17:23 says, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only have we moved into the Triune God, but the Lord is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His being in us is a matter of living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We move out of ourselves in order to be in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are in the Triune God, Christ can live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we remain in the Triune God and when Christ lives in us, we are perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we come together for the church service in ourselves, it will be impossible for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to serve in oneness, we must move out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We serve by moving into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, as we move out of ourselves and into the Triune God, we need to let Christ live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His living in us perfects us into one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By moving out of ourselves and into the Triune God, we have oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this is not yet the perfected oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only when Christ lives in us do we sense the reality of the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more the Lord lives in us, the more His living perfects us with others into the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Genuine oneness is not merely a matter of meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To have the genuine oneness, we must firstly move out of ourselves and into the Triune God; secondly, we must allow the Lord to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we are not only one, but also perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here in this genuine oneness there is no worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, or opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, there is just the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>REAL BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This perfected oneness is the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1954 I first began to speak of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I told the saints in Manila that they had to know who was above them, under them, and beside them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later I learned by experience that this concept of building is not accurate, for it applies only to a building with lifeless material that does not move from place to place, not to us as living ones who may move from one city to another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I asked the Lord to show me what the practical building was.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Gradually, mainly from Ephesians 4, I saw that real building is the proper growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we grow in life normally, we get out of ourselves and into the Triune God, and Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When this is our experience, we have the genuine oneness and we are perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are perfected into one, there is no problem with building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wherever we go, we are one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we remain in ourselves, we shall have problems no matter where we may be.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Real oneness is not merely relatedness, nor is it merely coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To grow in life means that we move out of ourselves and into the Triune God and allow Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we move into the Triune God and allow Christ to live in us, we can be one with the saints in any locality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have problems in the church, do not blame your environment or the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, blame yourself for not moving out of yourself and into the Triune God and for not allowing Christ to live in you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>ONE IN THE FATHER S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In John 17:22 the Lord Jesus says, And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father s life and divine nature John 5:26 to express the Father in His fullness John 1:18; 14:9; Col 2:9; Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This glory the Son has given to His believers that they also may have the sonship with the Father s life and divine nature John 17:2; 2 Pet 1:4 to express the Father in the Son in His fullness John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the glory which the Father gave to the Son and which the Son has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In such a glory there is no worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead, there is the Father s life and nature for His expression in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Here in the glory we have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Through His death and resurrection, the Lord has prepared a place for us in the Father and has opened the way for us to come into this place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After His resurrection, He began to bring us into the Father, that is, to move us out of ourselves and into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, He lives in us to bring us into the glory, which is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here in the glory we live by the Father s life and by His nature to express the Father in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this glory there is room for nothing but the Father s life and nature for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is where the Lord Jesus is today and where we should be also.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here in the Father s glory we have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the past, we did not see the truth concerning oneness in as deep a way as we see it today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we allow the Spirit of reality to work this truth, this reality, into our being, we shall have the genuine oneness, a oneness where there is no worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, or opinion, but only the Father s life, nature, and holiness for us to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the truth of oneness through sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all need to experience this sanctification through the Word and the Spirit so that we may enter into the Father and into His glory.</S>
