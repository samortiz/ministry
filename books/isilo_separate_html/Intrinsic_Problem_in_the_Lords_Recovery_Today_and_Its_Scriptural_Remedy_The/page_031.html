the Training Center and the Affiliation<br />
under One Leadership</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Church history reveals that in the history of one denomination after another, not all started as a denomination....The Lord did something among His people in a fresh way, with His presence and blessing. But after the saints in that group multiplied and other groups were formed, they all agreed together and decided to affiliate in order to preserve what they had received. The second thing they did again and again was to start a training center, a Bible School, or a Seminary to educate their people in the truth they had received. From there on out, it was a full-blown denomination. The first step is affiliation under one leadership; the second is some sort of training center. That is the way group after group has gone, and...we are also going that way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>We have never had a training center to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; our people as &ldquo;a Bible School, or a Seminary&rdquo; do. Our training is to train mainly the young saints to grow in the divine life and in the divine truth, to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, to feed the lambs of the Lord, to perfect the saints, and to build up the organic Body of Christ. We never had the intention to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; our people in a system of belief, in a kind of creed that will lead to the formation of a &ldquo;full-blown denomination&rdquo;; neither have we ever affiliated the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery &ldquo;under one leadership.&rdquo; We have never had any kind of &ldquo;affiliation.&rdquo; What we stress, according to the divine revelation in the holy Word, is the unique oneness both in the church as the organic Body of Christ and in the work to carry out the unique New Testament ministry. For keeping such a oneness according to the heart&rsquo;s desire of the Lord and according to the attributes of oneness that characterize the Body of Christ with the elements of the Divine Trinity (Eph. 4:3-6), there is the need of the proper leadership of the elders in the church life and the genuine leadership of the ministers in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. This is our real practice.</p>

Exalting Brother Lee above What Is Written</h2>
<p>&ldquo;...he [Brother Lee] has been exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6....We repent of having ourselves taken part in this. One of the brothers said to me at one time, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to put a sign up outside the meeting hall here&mdash;The Local Church of Witness Lee.&rsquo; I would hate that there would be in reality any such thing, but there has been a strong tendency toward this. The church should not be the church of anyone but Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>Thank the Lord that, by His grace, the ministry that He has given me has been greatly blessed by Him in the past years. Because of this, in all the years a certain regard has been rendered to me by the dear saints. But compared with the regard that the ancient saints rendered to the Apostle Paul because of his excellent ministry, the regard that I have received from the saints is much less. Paul was never accused of being overly regarded throughout the past centuries. No one ever said that he was &ldquo;exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
Brother Lee and His Ministry Having Been<br />
Made a Great Issue and Factor of Division</h2>
<p>&ldquo;...A spiritual leader should never be made an issue or a factor of division, but Brother Lee and his ministry have been made a great issue and factor of division among us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>The first clause of John&rsquo;s word here indicates that he admits that there are spiritual leaders, but the second clause makes an accusation regarding a matter that does not exist. There has never been a &ldquo;division among us&rdquo; that was made with me and my ministry as &ldquo;a great issue and factor.&rdquo; The intention of John, and of those who are for him, in trying to put my ministry aside is the real issue and factor of the division among us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
