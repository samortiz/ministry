<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">WORDS</h1><p>Words are one of the most important things in our lives. The Lord Jesus said, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). This shows that words express a man's heart; they show what is within a man's heart. If a man does not open his mouth, it is not easy for us to know his heart. But as soon as he opens his mouth, his heart is exposed. If a man does not speak, no one will know his spirit. Once he speaks, however, others will touch his spirit through his words; they will know his condition before the Lord. We can judge a person by the words he speaks.</p><p>Therefore, a believer must be very careful with his words. He must learn to speak the proper words. In the Bible, there are four or five places that tell us how to speak. Let us consider them one by one.</p><h2 class="head1">LIES</h2><p>First, we must not speak lies. John 8:44 says, "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it." When Satan speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own possessions, for he is a liar. He did not learn his lies from others. He is the father of lies. Satan damaged God's creation in the garden of Eden with lies. He has to lie in order to overturn God's work. Lying is a sin more common than any other sin. There are as many people who lie as there are people under Satan's hand.</p><p>As soon as man is saved by God, the first lesson he should learn is to reject any lie. He should reject inaccurate words, words that add to or come short of the truth, and intentional or unintentional lies. Lies should not be found in a child of God. If lies remain, it means that he is giving Satan the ground to maintain his grip.</p><p>If a man has never learned to reject lies, he will not realize how often he lies. The more a person tries to reject lies, the more he will find out that he is simply a lying person; even his heart is inclined towards lying. There are more lies in this world than we can think of, and there are more lies in us than we expect. If we have never learned to reject lies, we will not know how many lies there are. But once we resolve to reject lies, we learn how many lies there are in us. What a pity that among God's children, so many lies still exist! The Lord's word is clear and serious&mdash;Satan is the father of those who lie. In other words, all those who lie are the children of Satan. It is a pitiful thing for God's children to allow Satan's lying seed to remain in them! Brothers and sisters, we should not be believers for many years and yet never make a resolution to deal with our lies. Such a dealing is long overdue. As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he has to learn to speak accurately.</p><p>There are many kinds of lies; some are obvious, while others do not seem like lies at all. In reality, however, they are still lies. Some examples can be seen in the following:</p><h2 class="head2">Being Double-tongued</h2><p>Being double-tongued (1 Tim. 3:8) is speaking something in one circumstance and speaking something else in a different circumstance. It is saying that it is all right to do something to one person and not all right to do the same thing to another person. It is switching between yes and no and changing unpredictably. This kind of speaking is a lie.</p><h2 class="head2">Speaking according to One's Emotions</h2><p>Many people do not speak according to the truth or according to facts. Instead, they speak according to their likes and dislikes; they speak according to their emotions. If they like something, they speak a certain way. If they like a person, they speak a certain way, but if they hate something or some person, they speak another way. This is speaking according to our emotions rather than according to reality. This way of speaking is also lying. We must realize that we should not speak according to our feelings but according to facts. We should not speak according to our emotions. A Christian should learn to control his emotions to the extent that he will not speak according to his wish or imagination. Many people's words do not reflect facts; they reflect their imagination. When they wish that a certain sister would be good, they tell others how good she is. When they think a certain brother is about to fall, they tell others how bad he is. Actually, the one they say is good is not necessarily that good, and the one they say is bad is not necessarily that bad. Their words are based on their imagination rather than on facts. Man often speaks what he hopes to see and what he imagines to be true; his words do not reflect the true condition of a matter. We must learn to deal with this kind of speaking.</p>
