        <h2 class="head1">THE DESIRE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE</h2>
<p>The raising up of gifts, elders, and deacons should not merely be an item of our prayer; it should be our desire. In every church there should be many people rising up with the desire to become useful gifts and to become elders and deacons. This will meet God&rsquo;s present need for the salvation of many souls and for the fulfilling of our hope.</p>
<p>There is an unprecedented need for the gospel. The harvest is truly ripe and ready to be reaped. Furthermore, there are many believers in Taiwan, but they do not have a proper place where they can receive spiritual care, edification in life, and genuine help. When we see these situations, our heart is grieved. We should have met the needs of sinners by bringing them to salvation. We also should have met the needs of the saints by edifying them so that they would be useful in God&rsquo;s hand. However, we have failed to meet these needs. We cannot blame others for this lack, nor should we justify ourselves. We should humble ourselves to acknowledge our incapability and to condemn our shortcomings.</p>
<p>If we would make an effort, we would be able to meet God&rsquo;s need. However, we have failed to meet God&rsquo;s need, and as a result, many people are aimless. This shortage is not because we do not have enough truth, because our way is wrong, or because we are not standing on the proper ground. There is a shortage because we do not have enough useful persons&mdash;gifts, elders, and deacons. We need many brothers to rise up with a desire to become gifts, to be elders, or to be deacons.</p>
<p>Some saints will say that gifts are from God and that He gives gifts according to His will; hence, if God does not give us a gift, we cannot become one, even if this is our desire. They also say that when God gives gifts, we will receive a gift even if we do not want it. These statements sound spiritual, but in contrast to them the Bible says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:1). This proves that spiritual gifts can be desired. The Bible also says that we should &ldquo;earnestly desire the greater gifts&rdquo; (12:31). Even the overseership, that is, the eldership, can be desired. First Timothy 3:1 says, &ldquo;Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work.&rdquo; If we can desire to be an elder, we can surely desire to be a deacon. Therefore, we must be clear that we can desire to become gifts and to become elders or deacons.</p>
<p>We should not be so spiritual that we wait passively for God to give us grace. Gifts are obtained through desire. We can also desire to be elders and deacons. Whoever desires these things will receive them. D. L. Moody was a great gift from God to the church in the nineteenth century. D. L. Moody was a country boy who stuttered and was not very sharp. He was neither educated nor eloquent. After he was saved, however, he had a heart to preach the gospel and desired to bring people to salvation. As a result, he was equipped by God and became an eloquent and powerful evangelist. His story proves that we can receive the gifts that we desire.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1 uses the phrase <em>desire earnestly</em>. The meaning of this phrase is deeper and stronger than just to desire. The meaning of the Greek word is even deeper and stronger than its translation as &ldquo;desire earnestly.&rdquo; This same Greek word is translated as <em>jealous</em> in 1 Corinthians 13:4. The apostle&rsquo;s charge for us to earnestly desire gifts is very strong; it means that we should be jealous of gifts. Therefore, we should not only earnestly desire gifts; our desire should be so strong that we are jealous and that we hate not receiving a gift. If some among us would earnestly desire the gifts to the extent that they hate not being able to receive them, God would surely grant them gifts.</p>
<p>Many saints do not desire the gifts, because they do not love the Lord. A person who does not love the Lord or pursue spiritual things will not have such a desire. Other saints love the Lord and pursue spiritual things, but they do not have a desire for gifts because they are afraid of suffering and hardship. Should a lover of the Lord live for himself or for the Lord? Should a lover of the Lord live for his own enjoyment or for others to receive grace? Should he live for his desire or for the Lord&rsquo;s heart? Should he care for present comfort or for glory in that day? Does that glory attract us? The Lord&rsquo;s love caused Him to become a man, lay down His life, and shed His blood, but does this love encourage us?</p>
<p>If we realize that grace cannot flow to the earth without our being channels and that souls cannot be saved without our function, our only desire would be to have spiritual gifts and ministries. How joyful it is when a person receives a gift to help people know God. How honorable and glorious it is for a person to become an elder who administrates the house of God and leads the children of God to serve and worship Him. How sweet it is for a person to become a deacon in the church and to serve the children of God. If this is our realization, we will eagerly desire gifts and ministries.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
