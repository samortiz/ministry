   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE MYSTERIES OF THE KINGDOM 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 13:44-50; Exo 19:5; Psa 135:4; 1 Cor 10:32; Acts 20:28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The parables in Matthew 13 are concerning the mysteries of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean that these mysteries are not reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, these mysteries are themselves the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The difference is that this reality was presented by the Lord Jesus to His disciples in a mysterious way and not in an open way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He presented the mysteries of the kingdom in such a way that only those who have a heart after God's desire can understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are indifferent toward God's interests will find the parables very difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 13:11-15 the Lord Jesus told the disciples why He used parables as the means to reveal the mysteries of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He spoke in parables because the religious leaders, although apparently very religious and for God, were actually indifferent toward God's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had the forms and the appearance of seeking God, but not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were not sincerely concerned about God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Previous to this time, in Matthew 12:46-50, the mother and brothers of the Lord Jesus came to see Him, wanting to speak with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus learned of this, He asked, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He considered His brothers and sisters, not according to their flesh, but according to their concern for the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever is concerned for the will of God is His brother and sister and mother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that by the time of Matthew 12, the Lord Jesus had given up the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the flesh, the Jews are the Lord's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, at the end of Matthew 12, the Lord Jesus gave up that relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No longer did He have a relationship with anyone according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Henceforth, His relationships would be in the Spirit and related to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Jewish people cared only for the forms and appearance, with no care for God's concern, the Lord Jesus gave them up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After this, He began to speak about the reality of the kingdom in parables, not in an open way, but in a mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Throughout the past centuries of Christian history, these parables have not been fully understood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the first year after I was saved, I began to read the book of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a young Christian, I was very ambitious to know the Bible thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So I decided to write down every verse I did not understand, and eventually, I had too many verses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, I purchased some books, especially on Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some taught that we are the ones who purchased the field 13:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They gave a reference of Philippians 3:7-8, indicating we must sell everything in order to buy the field.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Other books indicated that the great tree was something positive Matt 13:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These books said that, at the beginning, Christianity was like a little seed sown by the Lord Jesus, but now, in its greatness, it has become something marvelous and magnificent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of interpretation indicates that their eyes were blinded.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this very chapter the Lord Jesus gave us the interpretation of the birds, telling us that they were Satan and his evil angels Matt 13:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These evil spirits, the birds, lodge in the great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the birds of the air, not the Triune God nor the saints, that lodge in the branches of the great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves that the great tree is connected to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How, then, can we regard the great tree in a positive sense?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is the dwelling place of God, where God makes His home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The great tree, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church can be compared to the vine tree of John 15, but not to that great tree of Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The vine tree is not useful for producing material goods.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have you ever seen furniture or a house built out of a vine tree?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The vine tree is good for producing grapes and wine something to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, the church must be small, not a great structure, but full of something to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that the evil birds lodge in the branches of the great tree proves that this tree is something negative.</S>
