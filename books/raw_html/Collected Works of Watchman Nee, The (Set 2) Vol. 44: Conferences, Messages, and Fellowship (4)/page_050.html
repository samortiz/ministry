<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF DEATH</h2><p>A man can be free from sin, but he cannot be free from the satanic operation of death. Romans 8 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die" (v. 13), and "the mind set on the flesh is death" (v. 6). The death spoken of in these two verses is not the death of the body nor the death of hell but spiritual death. The power of death is suppressing our spirit and putting it to death. Every believer can be under the effect of the power of death. For example, a Christian may have offended the Spirit and spoken something that should not have been said. Not only is the speaker under the power of death, but the words themselves spread death. When the power of death comes upon a man, it kills his spirit and depletes him of any vitality or energy. As soon as a man sets his mind on the flesh, he falls under the power of death. Any act that is according to the flesh affords death an opportunity to prevail upon man.</p><p>As long as Satan has not been cast into the abyss and the lake of fire, it is still possible for the power of death to operate in the believers. Once this power of death operates, a believer's spirit becomes bound and suffers damage. When a man hits a wall, the first part that is hurt is his nose, because the nose is the part that protrudes from the body. When a man spreads death, the spirit of others is the first part that is hurt, because man's spirit is the "protruding" part as far as life is concerned. Not only must the speaker release life in the meeting, but the ones in the audience must be receptive to life as well. How good a meeting is depends as much on the condition of the consuming elements as it does on the supplying elements. If the number of those who consume life becomes too large, the meeting will be taken over by death. On the other hand, if the number of those who supply life becomes larger, the meeting will be full of life. None of us should be a bystander in the meeting; even more none of us should spread any death. Whether we are speakers or listeners, our spirit should be on the alert and not allow death to take over; rather, we should drive away the power of death through prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERCOMING DEATH</h2><p>First Corinthians 15 says that death comes from Adam, while resurrection comes from Christ. In Adam all have died, while in Christ all will be made alive (v. 22). When the kingdom comes, the sting of death will be gone, and death will be completely annihilated. At that time mortality will put on immortality, and death will be swallowed up unto victory (vv. 54-55). From the time of Adam, death has been man's enemy. But in the end, this enemy will be annihilated. At that time Christ will be king and all things will be put in subjection to Him. The last enemy&mdash;death&mdash;will also be abolished (vv. 25-26). Hence, the kingdom will be a time when eternal life reigns. Not only will sin be terminated in the kingdom, death will be terminated as well. Although eternal life will not reign until the age of the kingdom, we can have a foretaste of the power of the kingdom&mdash;victory over death&mdash;today. As long as we walk by the Spirit and put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we will live with the Lord. "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace" (Rom. 8:6).</p>
