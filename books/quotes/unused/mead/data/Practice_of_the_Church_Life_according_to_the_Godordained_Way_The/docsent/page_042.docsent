   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the exercise of your spirit Luke 1:47; Psa 16:9 , you must exercise your mouth and your voice at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When someone exercises his spirit in speaking, he may shout.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But do not consider that mere shouting is the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must learn to exercise your innermost being when you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To lose your temper is a good illustration of releasing your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you speak in anger, without any consideration, without any fear, and without any care, you spontaneously release your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Exercising Your Mouth Your Tongue</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Your Voice Your Sound</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you prophesy, you must exercise your mouth, your tongue Psa 108:1; Acts 2:26 , and your voice, your sound 1 Cor 14:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you speak in the meeting, you should not forget that you are speaking to the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are not speaking just to yourself or to the person next to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, you must exercise your mouth and your voice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After I give a message, I often stress that in the time for testimonies the saints should speak loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have stressed this matter again and again, but I have seen very little improvement among the saints over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the brothers and sisters still remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not forget that when we come to a meeting, we are coming to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our singing and praying are also a kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even to say "amen" is a kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we enter through the threshold of the meeting hall, we should learn to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should realize that to exercise our spirit and to exercise our mouth are part of our job whenever we come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we meet together, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only when we cross the threshold of the meeting hall, but also beginning from our homes and on the way to the meeting, we should exercise our spirit to speak to the Lord, to sing, to pray, and to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Psalms, the exclamation "O" as in the phrase "O Jehovah" is often used 3:3, 7; 5:1, 3, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a great difference between the phrases "O Jehovah" and "Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you say, "O," immediately your spirit rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If while driving your car on the way to the meeting, you say in an exercised way, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah!" your spirit will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we speak, we must exercise our mouth to match the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must learn to do this and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must also realize that when we come to the meeting, our job, our duty, is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not in Christianity where pastors are hired to speak and to pray for the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even some denominations have so-called ministers of music to do the singing for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of practice is not the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The God-ordained way is for all of the believers to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we all exercise to speak in the meetings, the meetings will be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we come to the meetings without any stirring of the spirit and without any speaking, the meetings will be dead and will deaden everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we do not speak in the meeting, we actually kill the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a situation will leave the meeting to those who are over-exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the meeting not only will be killed but also may become chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the entire meeting will be annulled and confiscated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all have to learn to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we speak, we should exercise our voice, our sound, in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When someone does not exercise his voice in a proper way, he may speak without a definite direction, without striking a clear point, and in a halting manner.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There may also be a number of obscure points in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we exercise to speak with the proper sound and tone, the meeting will not be cooled down; rather, it will be stirred up by our speaking.</S>
