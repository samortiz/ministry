<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. STAYING IN THE CAVE OF ADULLAM<br>AND IN MIZPEH OF MOAB<br>AND IN THE FOREST OF HERETH OF JUDAH</H2><P>David went from Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam (1 Sam. 22:1-2; cf. Psa. 57, 142, titles). From there he went to Mizpeh of Moab (1 Sam. 22:3-4). But when Gad the prophet told him to depart and go into the land of Judah, David went into the forest of Hereth of Judah (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. SAUL KILLING AHIMELECH THE PRIEST<br>AND HIS FAMILY BECAUSE OF DAVID</H2><P>When Ahimelech's supplying of David was reported to Saul, he killed Ahimelech and his family (vv. 6-23; cf. Psa. 52, title). This shows that Saul was utterly rebellious toward God. He had no subordination to God, nor did he take God as his King and Head. He was constituted with rebellion, which equals the worship of idols (15:23). Every case of rebellion is a matter of presumption, a matter of daring to do things without God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. DEFEATING THE PHILISTINES<br>AND STAYING IN KEILAH</H2><P>According to 23:1-12 David defeated the Philistines and stayed in Keilah. Even though David was persecuted, he could still fight against the Philistines. However, instead of staying in the proper place, the good land, he stayed in Keilah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. REMAINING IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIPH</H2><P>David remained in the wilderness of Ziph (vv. 13-28; cf. Psa. 54, 63, titles).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Saul Seeking Him Every Day,<br>but God Not Delivering Him into Saul's Hand</H2><P>Even though Saul sought for David every day, God did not deliver him into Saul's hand (1 Sam. 23:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. David Being Strengthened<br>by Jonathan the Son of Saul to Trust in God</H2><P>David was strengthened by Jonathan the son of Saul to trust in God (vv. 15-18). There was an occasion when Jonathan could leave Saul and come to David for the purpose of strengthening him. Jonathan was surely a great provision for David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. David Hurrying to Get Away from Saul</H2><P>David hurried to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men in order to capture them. Then a message came to Saul that the Philistines had raided the land. So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went to meet the Philistines (vv. 25-28).</P>
