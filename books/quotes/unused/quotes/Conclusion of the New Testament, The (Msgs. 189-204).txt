Far in these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament we have covered four persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, and the believers
In the remaining messages we shall cover three corporate persons: the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem
According to chapter two of Daniel, Christ, the heavenly stone, will eventually become a great mountain filling the entire earth
In revealing the divine things, Paul, under the inspiration of the Spirit, uses the word 'economy' in his writings
If we know only this much concerning oikonomia, we shall not know the deep and complete significance of this Greek word
In order to have a household administration an administration in your house or family there surely is the need for a particular arrangement
From this we can see that God intends to have many sons to form His household through which He can carry out His eternal oikonomia
The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
The expression 'the purpose of the ages,' a literal translation of the Greek, simply means the eternal purpose
Besides the terms economy, mystery, and purpose, a number of other important terms are used by Paul in Ephesians
Three times in Ephesians 1 Paul speaks of God's will: the good pleasure of His will , the mystery of His will , and the counsel of His will
If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it
God's will is to have the church, and He has purposed to carry out the desire to have the church which He wants
Based upon His desire, will, and purpose, God made a plan, an oikonomia, a household arrangement, a household administration
The entire Triune God is embodied in Christ, for all the fullness of the Godhead, that is, of the Triune God, dwells in Christ bodily
Because the Triune God has embodied Himself in Christ, Christ is the mystery of God, the mysterious story of God
Hebrews 2 reveals that in His resurrection the Lord declared His Fathers name to His brothers and that His brothers have become the church
The church, then, is the mystery of Christ, who in turn is the mystery of God, who Himself is the mystery of the universe
The second mystery, revealed in the book of Ephesians and explained in it, especially in chapter three, is the mystery of Christ
In Ephesians 3:9 Paul speaks of 'the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things'
God's intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man would be mingled with God to produce the church
Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Moses knew how to build the tabernacle, but, not knowing the mystery of Christ, he did not know how to build the church
John told people that Christ was the One who would baptize them in the Spirit so that they might be regenerated
As we shall see in a following message, this revelation was first by Christ in the Gospels and then by the Holy Spirit in the Epistles
In Ephesians 3:5b Paul says that this mystery 'has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit'
The word 'spirit' here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God
When our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit, our spirit becomes the organ in which the mystery of Christ is revealed
The revelation received by the apostles and prophets in spirit is not a revelation mainly of secondary matters in the Bible
The eternal God, through the apostles and prophets, has made known this mystery to all the nations unto obedience of faith
The mystery of Christ is to make the multifarious wisdom of God known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies
Through the church God makes His wisdom known not mainly to human beings but to those rebellious angels who are the followers of God's enemy
How great was God's wisdom in designing the galaxies, the planets, the earth, the flowers, the birds, the animals, and man!
Because man was poisoned by Satan and corrupted by sin, God not only redeemed him but also regenerated him with His life
Now God is working continually to sanctify His regenerated people with His holy nature and to transform them with His element
The divine life is for regeneration, the holy nature is for sanctification, and the divine element is for transformation
No human word can tell the greatness of Gods wisdom in redemption regeneration sanctification transformation conformation and glorification
According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is our wisdom with respect to righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
The Lord is also the anointing within us, and daily He is sealing us, saturating us, anointing us, and permeating us
Only God has the wisdom to initiate such a wonderful thing, to make sinful and corrupted people the members of Christ
Many aspects of God's wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
God is not sorry that there is such an evil one as Satan because without such a one God's manifold wisdom could not be manifested in full
When all the believers are in the New Jerusalem and Satan is in the lake of fire, he will realize that everything he did actually helped God
Before we were saved, we were dead in trespasses and sins, and we were scattered and divided, utterly unable to be one
Now we are not only redeemed, saved, cleansed, freed, liberated, and regenerated-we are one with God and with one another
We are the church through which God's multifarious wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies
In the Godhead the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us
Many readers of the New Testament have not seen in the Gospels the revelation of Christ as the embodiment of God
In the Lord's first mentioning of the church, what is revealed is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe
Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man, which is the church
The church is not like the denominations, which are denominated after some person's name or according to some thing
The revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ is based upon the revelation of Christ, the Son of the living God
After the Lord asked His disciples to say who they thought He was Simon Peter answered and said You are the Christ the Son of the living God
According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed
Christ is the anointed One, the One upon whom God has poured Himself out as the ointment to accomplish His administration
On the day Christ was baptized, the Spirit of God descended upon Him , anointing Him for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
Christ's bringing forth the believers as the many sons of God involves the imparting of His being, of His element and essence, into us
God commissioned Christ not only to redeem us as fallen sinners but also to produce, to bring forth, the believers as sons of God
The Father's revelation concerning Christ is just the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church
The words 'this rock' refer not only to Christ but also to the revelation of Christ, which Peter received from the Father
Roman Catholicism claims that the rock in verse 18 refers to Peter, whereas most fundamental Christians say that it refers to Christ
It is not an insignificant matter that the church is built both upon Christ and upon the revelation concerning Christ
The problem today is that Christians like to form groups or so-called churches according to their concept and viewpoint
Any group that is built upon doctrines, views, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon the revelation concerning Christ
Today we should not minister anything other than the revelation of the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
For this reason, there is spiritual warfare between Satan's power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God's kingdom
The words 'the kingdom of the heavens' here are interchangeably used for the word 'church' in the previous verse
The authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself
Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth should be what has been bound or loosed in the heavens already
In this message we shall continue to see the revelation of the mystery of Christ, the church, given by Christ in the Gospels
Chapter sixteen relates to the universal building of the church, whereas chapter eighteen relates to the local practice of the church
If this church is not the local church but the universal church, we would not be able to 'tell it to the church'
According to the context of 18:17, in the local church we have both the reality and the practicality of the kingdom of the heavens
In a chapter dealing with relationships in the kingdom, the Lord Jesus eventually speaks concerning the church
Many Christians talk about the kingdom life, but without the practical local church life, this talk is in vain
Without the local church, the universal church cannot be practiced; rather, it will be something suspended in the air
The revelation of the church in Matthew 18 is, in particular, for the administration of the church in its locality
If we know how independent our natural self is, we shall be willing to submit to the government, the administration, in the church
Rather, you should go to him with one or two witnesses, hoping that the brother will listen to you and be rescued
The last part of verse 17 says, 'And if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as the Gentile and the tax collector'
A Gentile or a tax collector is someone who does not have fellowship in the kingdom life or in the church life
Because he will not listen to the one he has offended, to two or three witnesses, or even to the church, he becomes rebellious
Because such a rebellious brother will not listen to the church, the church must exercise the kingdom authority to bind him until he repents
When he repents, the church must exercise the kingdom authority to forgive him and restore him to the fellowship of the church
Strictly speaking, in verse 19 'ask' refers to prayer which deals with the brother who refuses to hear the church
If we pray according to the Lord's promise, our prayer will be answered, and the offending brother may be recovered
There is no need to have a big meeting but simply a meeting of two or three gathered into the name of the Lord
We have His presence, and His presence is the authority of the kingdom of the heavens for us to deal with a sinning brother
The church must be certain that it has the presence of the Lord as its reality; otherwise, it has no genuine authority
They may gather together in the Lord's name, but they are not the church, for if there is some problem, they need to tell it to the church
The fact that they need to 'tell it to the church' proves that they are not the church but rather part of the church
In Matthew 16 and 18 the universal church and the local church are unveiled not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential, practical way
In Matthew 18 the Lord unveiled the local church in an experiential way by telling us how to recover a sinful brother
The Lord's word in 18:20 indicates that the basic way to meet with the saints in the local church is by two or three
These two or three are gathered by the unseen Lord because they love the Lord and are concerned for His members
The proper translation of 18:20 is not that two or three are gathered together 'in My name' but 'into My name'
Because the name denotes the person, to be gathered together into the Lord's name is to be gathered together into His person
To be gathered into the name of the Lord means to be brought out of anything that is other than the Lord Himself
We need to be rescued by the Lord from so many occupying things and be gathered into His name, that is, into Himself as a living person
It is when we are gathered out of ourselves and out of all things other than the Lord and into Him that He is among us
Because we are the Lord's and have been saved by His name, we should gather only into that name and meet in that name
A local church is an expression of the Body of Christ in a certain locality composed of saints who mainly meet in small groups
They may exercise this authority to deal with the Devil and the demons behind, upon, and within a sinful, rebellious brother
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He could not reveal the deeper and more profound aspect of the church to those earliest apostles
He told them that they would have to wait until He sent the Spirit of reality to reveal to them the deeper aspects of the church
According to 14:26, the Spirit will teach us all things, and according to 16:13, He will guide us into all the reality
Regarding this, the Lord Jesus says, 'He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you
All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son , and all that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to us through the Spirit
Our understanding of the Son is by the Spirit, who has received whatever the Son is and then reveals this to us
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us
As the Spirit receives all that the Son has and unveils it to us, the revelation of the mystery of Christ, the church, is completed
The Greek word rendered 'searches' includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
The revelation of the mystery of Christ by the Holy Spirit is found in the Epistles, especially in the Epistles of Paul
If the church were merely a group of genuine believers called out of the world by God, the church would not be a mystery
Through the divine word and by the Holy Spirit this mysterious Christ, who is the unique mystery, has been imparted into us
The mysterious Christ, who is the mystery of God, has been ministered into our being, and now we have Him within us
We love one another not because we have been taught to love but because we have a loving factor-Christ as the mystery-within us
After His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, and He breathed Himself as such a Spirit into the apostles
From that time the apostles had within them the Spirit of reality to reveal the deeper and more profound aspects of Christ and the church
For this reason, in the eyes of our unbelieving relatives and friends we are a mystery, and they cannot understand us
Among the apostles who received the revelation of the deeper aspect of the church as the mystery of Christ, Paul was the leading one
The deeper and more profound aspect of the church, the church as the mystery of Christ, was fully revealed to Paul
Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the Holy Spirit revealed the church as the mystery of Christ to the apostles and prophets
The mingled spirit is the organ in which the deep and profound matter of the church as the mystery of Christ is revealed
We need to open our being, be poor in spirit, and pray that the Lord would reveal to our spirit what is on His heart concerning the church
God's wisdom is Christ , who is the hidden mystery predestined, pre-designated, and foreordained before the ages, in eternity, for our glory
God's wisdom in a mystery has not only been hidden but also predestined by God to become our destiny for our glory
The revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ by the Holy Spirit is the foundation upon which the church is built
Paul refers to this in Ephesians 2:20, where he says that the church is 'being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets'
Corinthians 3:11 says, 'Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ'
The foundation of the apostles and prophets is the revelation they received regarding Christ and the church for the building of the church
The churches in the Lord's recovery are built according to the revelation received by the apostles and prophets
In this message we shall cover two further matters related to the revelation of the mystery of Christ, the church, by the Holy Spirit
To bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things'
God wants to bring to light to all His creation the economy of His mystery which before the creation of the world was known only by Himself
In addition to having a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we also need the enlightening of the eyes of our heart
For this reason, in his prayer for revelation Paul continues by saying, 'The eyes of your heart having been enlightened'
Though we have wisdom revelation and eyes to see we still need light to enlighten the things which are open to us that we may have a vision
To have the eyes of our heart enlightened requires a thorough dealing with our conscience, mind, emotion, and will
Many believers cannot see God or receive the revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ because their heart is not pure
If we would have a pure heart, we must deal with our whole heart, that is, with all the parts that compose our heart
Along with this, our heart must have a cold and sober mind, a hot and loving emotion, and a soft and submissive will
When we have such a spirit and heart, the eyes of our heart will be able to see the church as the mystery of Christ
In the same principle, the divine power is being transmitted into us continually for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
Paul speaks of power, operation, might, and strength, using different words to convey something of the vastness of God's power to us
The surpassingly great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength which He wrought in Christ
In verse 21 Paul tells us that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named
The authorities here include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or bad, but also the human, earthly ones
In 12022 we see four aspects of the power that operated in Christ resurrection power transcending power subjecting power and headingup power
Christ is Head of all things to the church, and the surpassing greatness of the power that operated in Him is toward us who believe
The Body is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the head
The Body is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ who is continually being transmitted into us
After terminating all these things through His crucifixion, Christ entered into resurrection to germinate something new
The church, the Body, is an entity altogether in resurrection and ascension with both the natural element and the old creation terminated
The Body, an organism in resurrection and ascension, is wholly in the new creation and has nothing to do with the old creation
We all need to see that the Body has come into existence through the divine transmission from the resurrected and ascended Christ
Having considered Paul's prayer for revelation in Ephesians 1:17-23, we can see why he considers the church the mystery of Christ
We have also seen that the church as the mystery of Christ has been revealed in two steps: first by Christ and then by the Holy Spirit
In his spirit he received the completed revelation concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
In order for Christ to form the church it was necessary for Him to pass through death and enter into resurrection
Corinthians 15:45b tells us that in His resurrection and through His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
The disciples were 'startled and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit' , that is a phantom, a ghost, a specter
After showing the disciples 'both His hands and His side' , the Lord 'breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit'
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ
The Lord became the pneumatic Christ through resurrection, and today, in resurrection, He still comes to us as the Spirit, the pneuma
After the Lord Jesus came in John 20:19, there is no word or hint in John's record indicating that the Lord left the disciples
To the surprise of the disciples, at various times and in different places He would appear, manifesting Himself to them
Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He, having again received the consummated Spirit, poured out this Spirit upon all His disciples
On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed the Spirit into the disciples essentially as life for their spiritual existence
The Lord Jesus Himself is the pattern for the believers' receiving the Spirit both essentially and economically
On the day of the Lord's resurrection, the essential Spirit for the disciples' spiritual existence and being was breathed into them
The second step was the Lord's pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon the believers, baptizing them into one Body
By these two steps the believers were filled inwardly with the Spirit and were clothed outwardly with the Spirit
Inwardly they had the Spirit of essence, the essential Spirit, and outwardly they had the Spirit of economy, the economical Spirit
As a result they were altogether wrapped up with the Spirit and by being wrapped up with the Spirit they were formed into the Body of Christ
The church was formed through Christ's baptizing all the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, in one Spirit into one Body
Ephesians 1:22 and 23 tell us that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body
The important phrase 'to the church' implies that whatever Christ the Head has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church
The outpouring of the Spirit differs from the breathing of the Spirit into the disciples out of the mouth of Christ at His resurrection
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit is actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
By these two steps the Head of the Body baptized all His believers once for all, both Jewish and Gentile, into His one Body
The church is formed not only with all the believers as the extrinsic form but also with Christ as the intrinsic constituent
As believers, we are human beings, but in our humanity we have the constitution of Christ, for He has been wrought, constituted, into us
We are the church because we have been immersed into the Triune God and have Christ constituted into our being
There cannot be circumcision, those who observe Jewish religious rituals, and uncircumcision, those who do not care for Jewish religion
For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ'
The Christ who is the intrinsic constituent of the Body of Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God with His unsearchable riches
The fullness of the Godhead' refers to the entire Godhead, to the complete God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The fact that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that the Triune God is fully embodied in Him
The fact that all the fullness dwells in Christ bodily implies the physical body which Christ put on in His humanity
Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily
There are countless aspects of the riches of Christ, for He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe
We need to know and experience the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are for the producing of the church as His expression
The fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment
Because our life is our self and because Christ is our life, we may say that, in this sense, Christ has become us
As the intrinsic constituent of the church, Christ is not only the life of the church but also the nature of the church
Peter 1:4 indicates that the believers, as members of the church, the Body of Christ, have become 'partakers of the divine nature'
Because we, the believers in Christ, are children of God born of Him, we possess God's life and also His nature for our enjoyment
Concerning the consummated Spirit, John 7:39 says, 'The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified'
After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ
The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, clothing, lodging, and musical instruments
In using the expression 'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,' Paul likens the supply of the Spirit to that of the choragus
Christ as the intrinsic constituent of the church has been consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit to be the church's bountiful supply
The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of Christ's resurrection to be the Spirit of life to them essentially
The same Holy Spirit came upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power to them economically
On the day of Pentecost the disciples had both the Spirit of life within them and the Spirit of power upon them
We may say that the oil mingled with the flour was essential oil and that the oil poured upon the cake was economical oil
Eventually, the cake of flour, with oil mingled with it and poured upon it, became a loaf, and that loaf is a type of the church
We have seen that the church is formed by the mingling of human beings with the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit
The essential Spirit was the base, just as the oil mingled with the fine flour was the base for the meal offering
Upon this base Christ poured the economical Spirit typified by the oil poured upon the cake of the meal offering
There is an important difference between the formation of the universal church and the establishment of the churches
The church as a whole was altogether formed more than nineteen hundred years ago on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius
Now, after the formation of this universal church as a complete entity, there is the need for the spreading of the church
The entire church as the Body of Christ, including all the Jewish and Gentile believers, has been formed once for all universally
Assuming to do such a thing would be abominable in the sight of God, for it is presuming to do something that only God Himself can do
If we all have the desire to establish churches by planting church trees, the establishing of the churches will be very fast and prevailing
In this message and in the message following, we shall give a history of the planting of local churches recorded in the New Testament
According to this record, the planting of the churches began in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and went as far as Rome
It was not the universal church as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 1618 but only a part of the universal church which is the Body of Christ
The record of the New Testament concerning the matter of the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout
Whatever they heard they considered that it was for the church, because they looked upon their ears as the ears of the church
Acts 15:4 tells us that Paul and Barnabas, who had been sent forward by the church in Antioch, were received by the church in Jerusalem
The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder
Acts 63 says Now brothers select seven wellattested men from among you full of the Spirit and of wisdom whom we shall appoint over this need
The designation 'believers' denotes those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God's New Testament economy
The believers are also those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God
By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through accomplished attained and obtained
Judea was in the southern part of the Jewish land, Galilee was in the north, and Samaria was between the south and the north
Acts 11:19-26 records the spread of the gospel to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch through the scattered disciples
When the establishment of the local churches started with the one hundred twenty in Jerusalem, only typical Jews were involved
According to the record in Acts 13:1, the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were from a number of different sources
At the very beginning of this turn the pattern was established to indicate that the churches are composed of all races and classes of people
After the churches were established in Syria and Cilicia, Paul and Silas were sent by the apostles from Jerusalem to strengthen them
The Greek words rendered 'in every church' contain the preposition kata with the distributive usage-according to church
All the churches in which the elders were appointed respectively by the apostles in Acts 14:23 were established within less than one year
They were not voted in by their congregation; they were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity in Christ
In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit
To make an overseer a bishop of a district to rule over the elders of various localities in that district is grossly erroneous
The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder
Macedonia is a province of the Roman Empire in southeastern Europe between Thrace and Achaia on the Aegean Sea
The New Testament reveals that in a local church there is a unique group, and this group is composed of all the saints
For this reason, Paul did not say to all the saints 'and the overseers and deacons'; he said all the saints 'with the overseers and deacons'
Thessalonica, like Philippi, was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia
Thessalonians 1:1 says, 'Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ'
Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city
Although 1:1 is written in a simple way, it nevertheless includes Paul's characteristic reference to the organic union
The church, therefore, is a group of human beings who have been born of God and who have been brought into the organic union with Christ
Achaia was south of Macedonia and was a province of the Roman Empire, a great part of today's Greece, in which is the city of Corinth
It indicates that the church in Corinth was not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, nor of any practice or doctrine, but of God
In Romans 16:1 Paul says, 'I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea'
Paul held her in such high esteem that in the following verse he said that 'she has been a patroness of many and of myself as well'
If we mean business with the Lord in the church life, we also need to serve the church and care for it regardless of the cost
Eventually, the establishing of the churches spread to Italy, and a church was raised up in Rome-the church in Rome
The fact that there was a church in Rome is indicated by Paul's words in Romans 1:7: 'To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints'
There were not two churches in Rome, one called the church in Rome and another which met in the house of Aquila and Prisca
On the one hand, this couple was for all the churches; on the other hand, they were for their local church in particular
The church, the mystery of Christ, was first revealed by the Lord Jesus in the Gospels to the first group of the apostles
As a result, they were qualified to understand, in their spirit, the things concerning the church in a more intrinsic way
The Apostle Paul, in particular, received the deeper and more profound revelations concerning the church, the Body of Christ
In the foregoing messages we have also covered the formation of the church and the establishment of the churches
At the end of Ephesians 1 Paul says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
The universal church is the house of the living God, the Body of Christ, the bride that matches Christ as the Bridegroom, and the new man
The Son revealed by the Father is now building the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city
With this revelation as the basis, the Lord went on to reveal the universal church to Peter and the other apostles
Eventually, at the age of thirty, He came forth to manifest God by what He was, by what He did, and by what He spoke
The Lord Jesus expressed God not in the Godhead but in the fatherhood, for He made the name 'Father' known to His disciples
In order for God to fulfill His intention of working Himself into His chosen people, it was necessary for Him to be the begetting Father
The main thing the Lord Jesus did while He was on earth was to express the Father and make the Father's name known to His disciples
They did not know Him in the sense of His begetting but only in the sense of His being their origin through creation
After living a life of expressing God in the name of the Father, the Lord Jesus entered into death, carrying out an all-inclusive death
The first group, including the Epistles from Romans through Colossians, concerns the Body of Christ and our Christian life
The second group, from 1 Thessalonians through Hebrews, may be regarded as a supplement to what is covered in the first group
Four of the Epistles in the first group speak of the Body of Christ: Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians
Because Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians touch the Body of Christ, these Epistles are deep and profound
The universal church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, for His manifestation in the flesh
In the Old Testament both the tabernacle and the temple were called the house of God , which was a type of the church
The church is the composition of the believers, and the believers are the children of God, who are born of God and have His life and nature
If you look at a person's house, you will be able to tell what kind of person he is because a person's house is his expression
Timothy 3:16 shows us that the church as God's house, the pillar and base of the truth, is God's manifestation in the flesh
God not only desires to make home in the church and have a resting place there, but He also wants to express Himself in the church
All that He is, all that He is doing, and all that He wants to obtain are to be manifested in the church as His house
Christ is the Breather of the Spirit, the Baptizer in the Spirit, and the Giver of the Spirit as our constant drink
When we drink of the river of water of life we receive not only the water but also the nourishment from the tree of life
As the Breather, Christ breathed Himself as the essential Spirit into us to be the essence of our spiritual being and existence
As the riches of Christ are experienced and enjoyed by us, they become the fullness of Christ, the Body, for His expression
Christ's riches are so extensive that not only is Christ Himself filled with them, but these riches also fill up the members of His Body
God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches
If we talk about the church without having the expression of the church, our talk is entirely theoretical; it is not practical
If you do not have the local church, you cannot have the universal church, for the universal church is composed of all the local churches
The universal church was revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18, but the local church was revealed by Him in Matthew 18:17
If he does not listen, you should bring one or two with you to witness to him, expecting him to listen to them
It cannot be the universal church, for we cannot bring a problem to the universal church, only to the local church
What the Lord revealed in His second mentioning in Matthew 18:17 is the local church for the administration of the church in its locality
Matthew 16 concerns the universal building of the church, but Matthew 18 concerns the local practice of the church
Both chapters indicate that the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having the authority to bind and to loose
Except for a few Epistles written to individuals, all the Epistles in the New Testament were written to local churches
Whereas the universal church has been formed by Christ once for all, the local churches are established locally in separate cities
If we have only the local aspect but not the aspect of the church being of God, we shall have only an outward formality
On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality
The church is one, but the expressions of the church are many; and these many expressions of the church are the local churches
The churches are established in different cities by taking a city as the boundary and ground of each local church
If we read Revelation 1:11 carefully, we shall realize that the church in a place must be equal to the city in which the church is located
In other words, the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church is identical to that of the city in which it is established
In Revelation 1:11 the Lord Jesus makes it extremely clear that a local church is equal to the city in which it is located
The universal church is the unique Body of Christ, and all the local churches are simply the local expressions of this one Body
Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body
In the New Testament the church is mentioned again and again from the first book, Matthew, to the last book, Revelation
Because a church always covers the city, to appoint elders in every church is equal to appointing elders in every city
In the first local church, the church at Jerusalem , there were elders taking care of the government of the church
In Philippians 1:1 Paul addresses 'the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons'
To make an overseer a bishop of a district to rule over the elders of various localities in that district is grossly erroneous
The New Testament uses the word 'oversee' regarding the function of the elders, but it does not use the word 'rule'
To oversee is to observe the situation, condition, and need for the purpose of taking care of the church with all the saints
Rather, through the proper oversight the elders, the overseers, promote all the functions of each member of the Body
To oversee according to God means according to Gods nature desire way and glory not according to mans preference interest and purpose
In verse 17 'word' denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and 'teaching' denotes special instruction concerning particular things
The flock needs to be cared for, protected, led in the right direction, and brought to a place where they can eat and drink
In 5:2 Peter does not tell the elders to shepherd their own flock; he charges them to shepherd the flock of God
Peter makes it clear that the elders should not think that, because they are taking the lead in the church, the church is theirs
In 1 Peter 5:3 Peter says to the elders, 'Nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock'
The churches are God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care
According to the Lord's word in the Gospels and Peter's word in his Epistle, the elders are not to have any control at all
The clear word of the New Testament does not allow any ground for the elders to take rank or controlling power
Deacons and deaconesses, therefore, serve the local church , serving under the direction of the overseers, the elders
The overseers take care of the church, and the deacons and deaconesses serve the church by taking care of many practical matters
According to Ephesians 4, there are four special gifts-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers
Rather, among the saints who love the Lord and seek Him, some are gradually manifested to be apostles, evangelists, prophets, or teachers
On the one hand, the apostleship is an office in the universal church; on the other hand, an apostle is a gift
In their ministry to produce the churches, the apostles are a gift to the universal church, that is, a gift to all the churches
Throughout the ages, certain ones have been raised up by God to be apostles and have been given to the church as a gift
Because the elders in the churches are established and appointed by the apostles, the apostles are over the elders
They select the more mature believers and appoint them to be elders to shepherd, to take care of, a local church
The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction
The emphasis in the New Testament is not on the prophets' foretelling but on their speaking for God and speaking forth God
In the Bible as a whole and in the New Testament in particular, the word 'prophesy' does not mainly mean to predict
To prophesy in the sense of foretelling, of predicting something before it happens, is miraculous and does not require the growth in life
Whenever a prophet speaks for God, speaks forth God, or speaks in the way of foretelling, he must speak by the Spirit of God
If we speak for God or try to speak forth God without the Spirit of life, our speaking will be ordinary human speaking, not prophesying
To prophesy, either to predict something for God or to speak for God and to speak forth God, must be a speaking by the Spirit of God
The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction
All the four special gifts-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers-do not build the Body of Christ directly
It indicates that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers for the purpose of perfecting the saints
According to grammar, the phrase 'unto the building up of the Body of Christ' is in apposition to the phrase 'unto the work of ministry'
In verse 12 the work of ministry refers in particular to the work of the saints in building up the Body of Christ directly
Both the joints of the supply and every single part with its measure are needed for the church to build itself up
Because the divine life is organic, rich, moving, and active, it has a particular issue, a certain kind of outcome
The apostles receive the fellowship from the Father and transmit this fellowship to the believers by dispensing the divine life into them
If any member of our physical body does not participate adequately in the circulation of blood in the body that member will become unhealthy
All those who believe in Christ Jesus, who have received Him as Redeemer, Savior, and life supply, have the divine life
As long as we have the divine life flowing within us, we are in this oneness, the oneness of the Body, the oneness among all the saints
If we realize what the fellowship among the churches is, we shall not have the concept that a local church should be altogether independent
It seems that the Brethren either did not see or forgot that a local church is a part of the unique Body of Christ
It is possible that, among us in the Lord's recovery, certain churches or regions may make themselves independent
They do not want to keep their church or their region open to the entire Body, that is, open to all the local churches on earth
From this we see that we all need to pay careful attention to the crucial matter of the one fellowship among the churches
Although the administration of the church is separate and equal locally, the fellowship of the church is one universally
In 1 Corinthians 10:16 and 17 Paul says, 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
In verse 16 fellowship refers to the believers' communion in the joint participation in the body and blood of Christ
When we come together to partake of the Lord's table, we need to realize that the bread, the loaf, signifies all the churches
The Lord's table is not simply a remembrance of the Lord; it is also a testimony that we who belong to Christ are one
The fellowship of the Body of Christ, which is the fellowship among the churches, is the fellowship of the apostles
From this we see that all Christians should have one fellowship, the unique fellowship, which is the fellowship of the apostles
For this reason it is called the fellowship of the apostles in Acts 2:42 and 'the fellowship which is ours ' in 1 John 1:3
According to Acts 2:42, in the first church life there was only one fellowship, and that fellowship was of the apostles
In 1 John 1:3 only the Father and the Son are mentioned, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship
According to the picture here, the river in the New Jerusalem flows downward in a spiral until it reaches the twelve gates of the city
By enjoying the divine life in fellowship with the Triune God, we participate in this purpose and its outworking
The fellowship of the Body of Christ is expressed and practiced in our partaking of Christ's blood and body at the Lord's table
The cup, which is the cup of blessing, is a fellowship of the blood of Christ, and the bread is a fellowship of the body of Christ
Christ, the all-inclusive One, has given His body for us to eat and His blood for us to drink that we may enjoy Him
The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body
Just as the human body does not have organization but does have circulation so we should not have organization but we should have fellowship
The church in a certain locality or the churches in a particular region may not be willing to have fellowship with other churches
In 1 Corinthians 7:17 Paul says, 'Only as the Lord has allotted to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk
Romans 16:17 tells us that some 'make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned'
There is no thought in the New Testament that a teaching is good for one church but not for the other churches
There are different thoughts concerning head covering, but Paul told the saints in 11:16 not to be contentious concerning this
In choosing someone to take care of the offerings, conveying them from one place to another, the churches acted, moved, together
The sign of the lampstands in Revelation 1 indicates that the churches should be identical in essence, appearance, and expression
The Lord Jesus pointed out the differences between the seven churches, but He pointed them out in a negative and rebuking way
Romans 15:26 says, 'Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem'
The contribution among the churches is a matter of the saints caring for one another by the grace of God given to them
In 2 Corinthians 8:1 Paul says, 'We make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia'
When we supply needy saints with material things in the proper way, in spirit and with life, life and spirit go with this supply
Our giving to produce equality indicates that we are in the fellowship of the Body, that is, in the fellowship among the churches
