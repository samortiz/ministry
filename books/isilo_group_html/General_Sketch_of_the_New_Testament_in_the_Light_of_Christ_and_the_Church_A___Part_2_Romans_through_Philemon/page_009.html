We must also remember the word warring. There is warfare between the law in the members and the law of the mind. A sixth crucial term in Romans 7 is the word dead. We are dead to the law (v. 4). While we are still alive, we are obligated to the law, but when we are dead, we are liberated; we have no more obligations.<p>In Romans 7:1-6 Paul speaks of the law regarding the husband, and we are likened to a wife. After a woman marries, she is obligated to her husband; she has no liberty. When the husband dies, however, the wife is liberated. The interpretation of the husband in Romans 7 is a great problem. There have been many debates concerning who the husband is. Some say that the husband refers to the law, but how can the law die (v. 3)?<p>Verses 1-6 say, &#8220;Or are you ignorant, brothers (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law lords it over the man as long as he lives? For the married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband. So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man. So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God. For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins, which acted through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&#8221;<p>In these verses the husband, not the wife, dies, and the wife is released from the law of the husband. Some may interpret this to say that we have no obligation toward the old man as a husband, that rather we are obligated to the law. If this is so, then the husband is the law. However, there is a problem with this interpretation because these verses say that the husband dies. Since the law cannot die, it must be the old man that has died (6:6). From 1925 to 1927, I spent a great deal of time to study this matter. In the first letter I wrote to Watchman Nee I asked him who the husband is in Romans 7. In his reply, he said that on the one hand, the husband is the old man, but on the other hand, the husband involves the law. This is because the old man and the law are very related to one another.<p>On the one hand, we are the old man, while on the other hand, the old man is something we have. For this reason, Romans 6:6 uses the phrase our old man. When we were in the old man, we were obligated to the law of God. However, our old man has been crucified, so we are now released from the law. From this point of view, the husband is the old man, who is subject to the law, and we are the wife of the old man. While our old man is living, we as the wife of the old man are obligated to the law, but now that the old man as our husband has died, we are released from the obligation of the law.<p>The most important point in chapter seven is that our old man, that is, we as the old man, are dead in Christ. Therefore, we have nothing to do with the law. Hence, we should not try to keep the law anymore. We have no more obligation to it because the old man is dead and we are released. Chapter six tells us that we are dead in Christ, so we are released from sin (vv. 6, 11, 18, 22), while chapter seven also says that we are dead; here, however, it says that we are released from the law. In chapter six we are released from sin, while in chapter seven we are released from the law, both by our death with Christ. When we died with Christ, we were released from sin, and we were also released from the law. While we were living in the old man, we were under the bondage of sin, and at the same time we were under the obligation of the law. Now we are released from the bondage of sin and from the obligation of the law.<p>These are the most important matters in this section, but in these few chapters nearly every word is a key word. Chapter six speaks of the body of sin (v. 6), and chapter seven speaks of the body of death (v. 24). The physical body spoken of in chapter six is a body of sin, which in chapter seven is called the body of death. The body of sin is very active and powerful to commit sin, but in doing the will of God and in keeping the law, it is a body of death; it is inactive, powerless, and weak to the uttermost.<p>In chapters six and seven there is another important term, which is personified Sin. Romans 6:14 says that sin lords it over us, and 7:17 says that sin dwells in us. The apostle Paul says, &#8220;But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&#8221; (v. 20). Sin, therefore, is something living, moving, acting, and doing things within us and through us, indicating that it is alive.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
