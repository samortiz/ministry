   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ASSISTANCE ENJOYED BY THE CHURCH Assistance from Hebrew Religion Judaism</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a sense, the church came out of Judaism; at least, the first group of people in the church came out of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Old Testament occupies a significant portion of the Bible read by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews and the members of the church believe in and worship the same one God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From a historical viewpoint, the early members of the church received most of their knowledge of God from Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From a spiritual viewpoint, the revelation they received came from the Old Testament, which was originally in the hands of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, Judaism gave the church a great advantage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A very small portion, perhaps only one percent, of the Lord s ministry on the earth was in the realm of the Gentiles and to the Gentiles; the remaining ninety-nine percent was in Judaism and for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The manger that produced the church was the Jewish temple in Jerusalem; the temple was the place in which the church was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Acts 1 the one hundred and twenty were praying in the upper room v. 13 when they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit 2:2-4 , but their meetings were held in the Jewish temple v. 46 . If Judaism had not persecuted the church, we would have to acknowledge that it helped the church enormously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the early days the apostles preached the gospel in Jewish synagogues 9:20; 13:5, 14; 14:1; 18:4; 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, they did not need to build meeting halls or prepare seating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even after Paul passed through Asia and came to Macedonia in Europe, he went to a place of prayer beside the river on the Sabbath to preach the gospel 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was a convenience given to the church by Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the Old Testament had been translated into Greek the Septuagint version so that even Greek-speaking Gentiles could read it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul did not need to print Bibles; he could simply enter a synagogue and read the Bible, and everyone could understand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we frequently encounter difficulties in new fields for the gospel; however, the early apostles had the convenience of Judaism as a bridge and medium for their preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Assistance from Greek Culture</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Greek culture helped the church most by providing a unified language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I first began to serve the Lord, I encountered the problem of not having a unified language.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I went from Shantung Province to Shanghai and encountered a different dialect, which made it difficult to communicate in preaching the word and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was difficult to communicate even when going to the store.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the Sino-Japanese War, the situation changed; we could speak the Mandarin dialect wherever we went even in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At least seventy percent of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can speak Mandarin Chinese; there are a few elderly ones who cannot speak it, but at least they understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This aids our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we speak different Chinese dialects, at least the different dialects have the same written form and are from the same linguistic family.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Despite these similarities, however, we still have problems in communication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Imagine how difficult it would have been in the age of the apostles if writing and speech were not in one unified language.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It would have been even more difficult to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord for His preparation work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before the church was produced, Greek writing and speech had become prevalent in the region around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, when the apostles were writing the New Testament, they gave up Hebrew and used Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Greek was the unifying language of the peoples surrounding the Mediterranean Sea; this was a great convenience to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Greek was the most appropriate language for the Holy Spirit to use in developing the truth; it was more appropriate for the New Testament to be written in Greek than in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the early apostles went out to preach the gospel, churches were easily raised up in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was by the power of the Holy Spirit, but the Greek language was undoubtedly a help in the endeavor.</S>
