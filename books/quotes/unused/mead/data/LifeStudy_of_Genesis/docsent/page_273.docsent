   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c The Ministry of Melchisedec</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How was it possible for one who escaped to have come to Abraham, and how could Abraham have made such a brief and bold decision?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What happened so that, after a short time, the enemy ran away?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Melchisedec came in. Who is Melchisedec? He is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is very much like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he came in, it signified that Christ came in. He was a type of Christ as God's High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not revealed in Genesis 14, but it is found in Psalm 110.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Psalm 110 we are told that God's anointed One, the very Christ, is the Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, an order which is prior to that of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before Aaron came into the priesthood, Melchisedec was God's Priest already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Aaronic priesthood dealt with sin, taking care of things on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ministry of Melchisedec, on the contrary, is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Melchisedec did not come in to take away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not appear because Abraham had sinned but because Abraham had gained the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Melchisedec did not appear with an offering to take away sin but with bread and wine to nourish the victor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nearly all Christians consider Christ as the High Priest who takes care of sin, but hardly anyone pays attention to Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As such a High Priest, Christ does not take care of sin but ministers to us the processed God, signified by the bread and wine, as our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you not believe that before Melchisedec came to minister bread and wine, as the priest of God he was interceding for Lot and Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that he was.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not believe that Melchisedec was sleeping during all the fighting and that when he heard the news of Abraham's victory he hurriedly appeared to Abraham to minister bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe that Abraham's brief and bold decision to fight for the rescue of Lot was stirred up by the intercession of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also believe that the one who came to tell Abraham of Lot's capture escaped because Melchisedec was interceding for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a priest, Melchisedec must have been taking care of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In answer to his intercession, one escaped from Sodom, told Abraham the news, and Abraham made the bold decision to fight for the rescue of Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While we walk on this earth, many things happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apparently, these things just happen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, behind the earthly scene, an intercession is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our Melchisedec, our High Priest Christ, is still interceding for us in heaven Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His intercession overshadows us and cares for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Melchisedec's coming to Abraham was somewhat of an indication of Christ's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What are we, today's Abraham, doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are slaughtering the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some of God's people, like Lot, have suffered defeat after defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By God's mercy, some others need to be today's Abraham who experience victory after victory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to learn the basic lesson that our God, the One who called us, is the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are living for Him on the earth and we are His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not tolerate any damage to God's interest on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we hear of such damage, we make a quick decision to defeat the enemy and to slaughter the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to slaughter some kings daily.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to slaughter the kings in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to slaughter the kings in our environment, families, and schools.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we have finished our slaughter of the kings, our Melchisedec will come to us, meet with us, and celebrate our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord will not come back until we have slaughtered all the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then He will return and drink the fruit of the vine with us, as indicated by His word in Matthew 26:29: "I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Melchisedec interceded for Lot and Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today Christ, our High Priest, is interceding for all the overcoming ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While He is interceding now for us in heaven, we are slaughtering the kings on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the overcoming ones slaughter all the kings, our Intercessor, the High Priest of the Most High God, will appear with the full taste of the processed God.</S>
