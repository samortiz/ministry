<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE FLESH AND THE WORK OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 17, 1936, morning<br />Place: Amoy</h1><h2 class="head1">THREE GREAT ENEMIES OF GOD'S PEOPLE</h2><p>In the history of the Israelites, God's people had three main enemies: the Egyptians, the Philistines, and the Amalekites. The world is signified by Egypt; the power of darkness, who is Satan, is signified by the Philistines; and the flesh is signified by the Amalekites. The Triune God has a triune enemy who frustrates His people from following Him. Outside of God's people, there is the world, under them there is Satan, and within them there is the flesh. These three enemies work together to frustrate God's work among His people.</p><p>Egypt typifies the world that binds us; it signifies the worldly living and everything that occupies us and causes us not to serve God. The Philistines typify the authority of darkness, the power of Satan, which frustrates us and disturbs us. The Amalekites typify our flesh. Outwardly speaking, the Amalekites were not as menacing as the Egyptians and the Philistines. They opposed the Israelites who had left Egypt and would not allow them to enter Canaan. The Amalekites cooperated with the Egyptians and the Philistines to stop the Israelites from entering Canaan. This typifies the work of the flesh in us, frustrating us from fully entering into the heavenly position to enjoy God's salvation.</p><p>These are the three most damaging enemies that attack our Christian life on earth today. First, the world takes away our love of the Father (1 John 2:15). The world is versus the Father. Second, Satan causes us to rebel against Christ's authority. First John 3:8 says that the Son of God was manifested for the purpose of destroying the works of the devil. Hence, Satan is versus Christ. Third, the flesh lusts against the Spirit within us (Gal. 5:17). Hence, the flesh is versus the Holy Spirit. We can see that the triune enemy is versus our Triune God. The world is versus the Father, Satan is versus Christ, and the flesh is versus the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The trouble today is that many Christians love the world and are bound by the world; they do not want to leave Egypt. There are also Christians who do not realize their heavenly position, which is their Canaan. They have never heard of the ascended place of Christ nor experienced it. Thus they are blocked from entering Canaan. Victory over the world is the initial stage of the Christian life, while the heavenly position in Christ signifies the highest peak of the Christian living. This morning we will not speak about the world or Satan. Our emphasis will be on the problem of the flesh. The flesh is manifested not only in our personal lives, but many times in God's work as well. If it were only manifested in our personal lives, the matter would not be that serious. But when it is manifested in God's work, the glory of God will suffer great loss.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS THE FLESH?</h2><p>How does the flesh manifest itself in the work of God? First, we must know what the flesh is. Once we know what the flesh is, we will know how it is manifested in the work of God. We can know what the flesh is from the Bible. Simply put, everything that originates from the natural life is of the flesh. The flesh is what we have acquired from our natural life; it is what we have inherited and what we possess from birth. Anything that does not come as a result of our regeneration is the flesh. It does not matter how much and what kind it is, as long as it does not originate from our regeneration, it is the flesh. How do we know this? The answer is in John 3:6. The Lord said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." Thank God that everyone who is sitting here today has had these two births already. We were all born of the flesh, and we have all been born of the Spirit. These two births often occur twenty to fifty years apart. That which is born of the flesh means that which we received when we came out of our mother's womb. That which is born of the Spirit means that which we received when we were regenerated. There is a time difference between these two occurrences. The birth of the flesh happens first, and the birth of the Spirit happens later.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." A regenerated person inherits every spiritual thing that can be inherited at the time of his regeneration. Only after the Spirit begets the spirit are there spiritual things. Do you want to know what is of the Spirit? It is not difficult to know this. All you have to do is to find out what you have received since your regeneration. Then you will know what is of the Spirit. If you set aside all the new things you received from the Spirit's regeneration, the flesh would be all that was left. What does the flesh include? It includes everything that is in the natural realm and everything that you had originally. There are two aspects to the flesh, one is filthy and the other is clean. One is sinful and the other good. Before a man is regenerated, not only does he commit sins, but he commits "goodness" as well. Many non-Christians have good works, but according to God, these good works are not of the Holy Spirit, because they are not born of the Spirit. God wants to remove not only all of man's sins, but all of his goodness as well. Anything that is not from the Spirit, whether good or bad, is rejected by God and must be removed. God only wants that which comes from the Spirit. He does not ask if something is good or evil; He only asks if such a thing is from the Spirit or the flesh. He does not ask about the nature of a thing; He only asks where it comes from. Anything that comes from the flesh is of the flesh. It is easy for man to see the evil and sinful part of the flesh. But it is difficult to discern the good part of the flesh. We must therefore pay particular attention to the good part of the flesh.</p>
