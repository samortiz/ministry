   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Not Being Curious</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, in trying to be accurate, we must not become curious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's Word is accurate, but we must never search it with a curious mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we search God's Word with a curious mind, we will miss the spiritual worth of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is a spiritual book, and we must exercise our spirit before we can understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the purpose of achieving accuracy is the satisfaction of our curiosity, not the satisfaction of our spiritual needs, we are on the wrong track.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is unfortunate that many people read the Bible with the goal of digging out strange things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some people have spent a great deal of time trying to ascertain whether or not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of study of the Bible is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must remember that the Bible is a spiritual book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to touch life, touch the spirit, and touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we touch the spiritual things, we will spontaneously recognize the literal accuracy of the Word because all spiritual things are intrinsically accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if our premise is not a pursuit of spiritual things, we will be on the wrong track.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people like to take the pathway of curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their study of prophecies is driven by curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They study prophecies not for the sake of waiting for the Lord's return, but because they want to know about the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a big difference between being spiritual and not being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are a curious person, all spiritual and valuable things will become non-spiritual and dead when they fall into our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before the Lord, we have to distinguish between things which are valuable and things which are not so valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to distinguish between the things which are important and the things which are unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said, "One iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law" Matt 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But He also said that there are "weightier matters of the law" 23:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The law is so accurate that one iota or serif cannot pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But there are also weightier things in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Curious ones constantly pick up lighter things and study them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they keep taking the lighter things, they will end up being lighter persons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Lord Jesus said, they are straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel v. 24 . They strain out the tiniest things and swallow the biggest things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of reading is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This error comes from one's disposition for curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not change our disposition, we cannot expect to read the Bible well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The above mentioned traits subjectivity, carelessness, and curiosity are common flaws among men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must try to overcome these flaws before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be objective, accurate, and non-inquisitive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An objective, accurate, and non-inquisitive character will not come to us in one or two days; we have to discipline ourselves to develop such a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as we pick up the Bible, we should read it objectively, accurately, and non-inquisitively.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we have the right character and the right habit, we will know how to read the Bible properly.</S>
