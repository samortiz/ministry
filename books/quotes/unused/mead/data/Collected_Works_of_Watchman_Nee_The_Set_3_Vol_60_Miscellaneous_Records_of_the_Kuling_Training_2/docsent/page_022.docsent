   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JESUS BEING A FRIEND OF SINNERS Friendship Being an Extraordinary Relationship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible says that Jesus is a friend of sinners Matt 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the meaning of a friend?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A friend is a person whom one loves in an extraordinary relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Friendship is a relationship that is out of the ordinary, that pays no regard to status.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Master-servant relationships, spousal relationships, sibling relationships, and parent-children relationships are all ordinary relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Friendship is an intimacy that goes beyond these relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Friends are people who are not linked to each other by ordinary relationships, but who love one another and are drawn to one another apart from such ordinary relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such ones may be fathers and sons, but they are also friends apart and aside from their father-son relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that friendship is a relationship that has no regard for status.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people are employer and employee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As far as their statuses are concerned, there is a difference of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, they can also be friends apart from such a normal relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Sinner Can Approach the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>without "Proper" Procedures</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord is God, and we are man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the Savior, and we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are the obvious relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord is also willing to establish a friendship with us outside of such normal relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the Bible calls Abraham the friend of God 2 Chron 20:7; James 2:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was able to be a friend to Abraham because He put aside His own status.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham also put aside his status.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the two became friends with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus is the Savior, and we are sinners; this is the "normal" relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Under this normal relationship, there are "proper" procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, a sinner must believe and be baptized before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the proper procedure under a normal relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible, however, has a wonderful declaration: the Lord Jesus is also a friend of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that apart from the normal relationship of Savior with sinners, there is another relationship that of a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A sinner can bypass the "proper" procedure and confer with Him as a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He can ask the Lord, "How are you going to save me?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, a sinner can receive the Lord as the Savior without going through the proper procedures of salvation such as repentance, confession, believing, receiving, and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under normal circumstances, a sinner must go through these steps before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But thank the Lord that He is also a friend of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can come to Him as His friends.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sinners can come to the Savior and ask for help as His friends without going through the "proper" procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, there was a man in the Bible who wanted to believe the Lord but was not able to.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He cried to the Lord, saying, "Help my unbelief!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mark 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here was a man who was in unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet he could still come to the Lord and ask for help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider the example of Luke 18:18-23.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The young ruler wanted to inherit eternal life, and the Lord charged him to sell all he had, distribute to the poor, and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The young ruler could not do this, and he left sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord wanted him to sell his all; this is the proper procedure under a proper relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The young ruler felt that he could not comply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He should have come back to the Lord and conferred with Him based on the relationship of a friend and said, "I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please help me!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord surely would have helped him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unfortunately he did not make use of this friendship to confer with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, he turned away in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Friendship Being Unconditional</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the Lord Jesus is the friend of all the sinners, they are able to come to Him just as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They can confer with Him and seek His help.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Originally, a sinner could only come to the Lord according to the proper procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if he comes to Him as a friend, this approach is unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A sinner can approach the Lord boldly just as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose a father demands that his son be obedient to him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the son does not obey him, he has trespassed in terms of his proper relationship with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet apart from this proper relationship, the son can approach the father as a friend and say, "I cannot obey you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please help me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The father can tell the son what he must do to obey based on their relationship as friends.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, the friendly relationship can make up for the breakdown in the proper relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A gospel preacher should allow a sinner to receive salvation under any condition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He can even forget all conditions and bring the sinner to the Lord with no conditions specified whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The initial step of the gospel is for a sinner to treat the Lord as his friend.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The consummate step of the gospel is for a sinner to treat Him as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some may ask, "If a person does not believe in God, how can he come to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if a man does not believe in God, he can still come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Under proper conditions, a man must believe in God before he can come to Him Heb 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But as long as a man calls on God, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Man thinks that he has to acquire a certain amount of faith before he can come to God, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord is a friend of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Anyone can come to Him and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Under proper conditions, a man has to repent when he comes to the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if a man comes to the Lord by acknowledging Him as the friend of sinners, he can come to Him even without repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If our preaching is based on the fact that the Lord is a friend to sinners, we will bring sinners to the Lord immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once we push a sinner into the presence of the Lord, something will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>WHOSOEVER WILL CAN COME TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to allow the Lord Himself to work on the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not preach the gospel according to our own concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no sinner on earth who is so evil that he cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is no sinner whose condition is so hopeless that he cannot be brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No matter what kind of sin a person has committed, no matter what kind of person he is, he can come to the Lord because the Lord is a friend of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is the Spirit who operates to bring men to repentance and to reject the world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we realize that the Lord is a friend of sinners, the nature of our gospel will be uplifted, and our gospel will be greatly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>First, we must have a strong assurance of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must believe in this fact, and then we can bring many people to salvation through our preaching.</S>
