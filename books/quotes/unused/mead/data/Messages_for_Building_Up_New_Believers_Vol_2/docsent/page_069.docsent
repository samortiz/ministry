   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. If He Does Not Care, the Lord Will Save Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said that there is no need to separate if the other party does not care.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How do you know that the Lord will not save him through you?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he does not care and wants to continue living with you, Paul said that you should be at peace with him and should not leave.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said that an unbeliever can be sanctified through a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said also, For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife? v. 16 . If the other party wants to leave, that is his concern, not yours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if he does not want to leave, you have to believe that the Lord will save him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul said that it would be easy for him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It may not be that easy for the Lord to save others, but it would surely be easy for the Lord to save one who is already yours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to deal with this matter by taking such a stand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WHAT TO DO IF ENGAGED TO AN UNBELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some brothers and sisters have another problem: They are engaged to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. It Being Best for the Unbelieving Side</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>to Take the Initiative in Breaking the Engagement</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is clear that the Lord does not want us to marry unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone is already engaged to an unbeliever, the best thing would be for the unbelieving fianc or fianc e to voluntarily break the engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The two are not yet married; they only have an agreement to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord opens the way for the unbelieving side to voluntarily break the agreement because the other one has believed in the Lord, that is the best solution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Not Annulling Any Agreement Arbitrarily</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, it is often impossible to have such a solution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because a marriage agreement exists, the other party may not easily let go just because you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At such times, you need to realize that an engagement to a person is a covenant with that person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a covenant is a promise you have made before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Christian cannot arbitrarily annul a covenant just because he has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any covenant is holy in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can suggest a dissolution to the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The other party can initiate such a dissolution, or you can initiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The proposal need not be initiated by the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is different from the earlier case.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the case of a marriage, the other party must initiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the case of an engagement, you can initiate the dissolution of the engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the other party insists that you fulfill the marriage agreement, you have to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once something comes out of the mouth of a Christian, he has to honor it; he cannot annul it arbitrarily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We receive salvation because God honors His word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God did not honor His word, there would not be any salvation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, you have to negotiate with the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the other party is unwilling to dissolve the relationship, you have to marry him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 15:4 says, Should he swear to his harm, / He does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, the Gibeonites deceived them with dry, moldy bread, old patched shoes, and worn garments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They said that they came from a far country, and Joshua promised not to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, he found out that they were actually from a near country.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because a covenant had been made with them, God would not allow the Israelites to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the most, they were made woodcutters and drawers of water Josh 9:3-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Honoring one s covenant is a serious matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is all right for you to annul an engagement only if the other party is willing to annul it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if the other party is not willing to annul it, you cannot annul it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The covenant with the Gibeonites produced serious consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rain was withheld from heaven because Saul slaughtered the Gibeonites.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>David was forced to ask the Gibeonites what he should do for them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Gibeonites demanded that seven of the sons of Saul be hung, and David had to comply 2 Sam 21:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God will not allow us to breach a covenant arbitrarily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must learn to honor any covenant we make.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot do anything that is unrighteous.</S>
