[1]  At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God is seen creating man as the center of the whole creation for the purpose of expressing Himself.
[2]  In His economy God intended that man should express Himself as the center of His whole universe.
[3]  At the beginning of the Word of God, we are shown two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2 .
[4]  After God created man, He placed him before these two trees, and man's whole life and walk was pictured as a matter of feasting upon one tree or the other.
[5]  God instructed man clearly: if he partook of the second tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would have death; but if he partook of the first tree, the tree of life, he would have life.
[6]  It was God's intention for this neutral, innocent man to take God into himself, that God and man, man and God, would be mingled together as one.
[7]  God, standing on one side, is the source of life, as represented by the tree of life; Satan, standing on the other side, is the source of death, as represented by the tree of knowledge; and Adam, standing in the middle, is neutral with two receiving hands.
[8]  But, as we know, Adam was induced to take the second source, the tree of knowledge, into himself.
[9]  After God became a man and put that man with Satan within him upon Himself, He brought that man to the cross.
