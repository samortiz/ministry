   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 There should be no tension in meetings or in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding church business, learn not to do too much yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Distribute the business among others and make them learn to use their own discretion in making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You should first brief them on the fundamental principles to follow and ascertain afterwards whether they have acted accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is wrong to do too much personally.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Avoid showing yourself in excess in meetings, otherwise the brothers may feel that you are monopolizing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Learn to place trust in the brothers and divide it among them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>6 The Spirit of God cannot be coerced in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to be submissive to Him; otherwise, once He stops anointing, the church will feel tired or possibly even bored.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If your spirit is strong, it will sweep over and overwhelm the audience within ten minutes; if it is weak, even shouting some threatening words and spending a longer time will not help and may even be harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>7 In delivering a message, do not make it too long or too elaborate; otherwise, the spirit of the saints may tend to feel bored.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not include superficial thoughts or base statements in the contents of your message; avoid childish examples as well as those reasons which are so common that people will consider them childish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Learn to finish delivering the essence within half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that, when you yourself enjoy your message, the words are necessarily those of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>8 The temptation often encountered at a prayer meeting is to deliver a message or to speak at length.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A prayer meeting should be devoted to praying; too much talking will make the conscience feel heavy with the result that the meeting becomes a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>9 The work at Kuling, Fukien, in 1948 was an exceptional case.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Workers should learn a lot before getting into a position where they deal with problems or persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With inadequate learning, insufficient knowledge, incomplete brokenness, and unreliable judgment, one will be incompetent to deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not jump to conclusions; even when one is about to do something, he should do it in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not treat spiritual matters lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Learn in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>10 Learn not to trust your own judgments only.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is considered right may not be so; what is regarded wrong may not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one is determined to learn humbly, it will take at least a few years to complete.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, for the present, you ought not to have too much confidence in yourself or be too definite about your way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>11 It would be a dangerous thing for people in the church to follow your decisions before you reach the state of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord will work on you to deal with your thoughts and to break you before you can understand the will of God and thus be His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Authority is based on the knowledge of the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where the Lord's will and purpose are not manifest, there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>12 The capacity of a servant of God should be constantly expanded by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I think He is now doing it; you need not look inward, since this will make you disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God may wish you to assume the responsibility of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As to the work in Hong Kong, it is possible that some brothers will feel led to join it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I think we ought to have rest in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yours in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nee To-sheng Watchman Nee</S>
