These seventeen chapters form the second section of this book. Now, in this concluding word, I would like to consider six matters that are the main points in chapters eleven through twenty-seven of Leviticus.<h2 class=head1>OUR SITUATION</h2><p>The first five chapters of this section of Leviticus unveil our situation. According to these chapters, our contact with others may be unclean, and our source, our origin, is uncleanness. Furthermore, our condition is one of leprosy, and whatever comes out of us as a discharge is unclean. This is our situation as it is clearly unveiled to us in chapters eleven through fifteen.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S REDEMPTION</h2><p>The second main point is Christ&#8217;s redemption. Instead of the word redemption, the word used in Leviticus is propitiation. Christ&#8217;s redemption, His propitiation, has solved our problems and has brought us back to God. We have not only been redeemed back to God and brought into His presence- we have been brought into God Himself. Now we are in the consummated Triune God, and here, in Him, we have full enjoyment.<h2 class=head1>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Having been brought back to God and into God by Christ&#8217;s redemption, we may now enjoy all the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God. This is fully revealed in Leviticus 23, a chapter that speaks of the seven feasts, which are seven festivals for our enjoyment of all the riches of our God. It is in God Himself that we have the enjoyment of His riches. By enjoying the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God, we become His expression. This means that we become the Body of Christ as the enlargement of Christ to express Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE JUBILEE</h2><p>Our enjoyment of the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God brings us to the fourth point-the jubilee. The jubilee is the completion and the consummation of our enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God in God Himself. When we enjoy the Triune God in all His riches and when we have this enjoyment in the Triune God Himself, we will reach the jubilee, which will be for eternity.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_235.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_237.html">Next</a> </body></html>
