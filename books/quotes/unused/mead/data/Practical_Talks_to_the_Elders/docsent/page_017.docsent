   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SACRIFICING TO PUT YOUR CHURCH FIRST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Again I say, to take this way to care for the church means that you have to sacrifice a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You cannot consider yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have recently spent many, many hours between the millstones being ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My wife spoke with me after some of these grinding talks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She reminded me of my age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I told her I surely realize my age, but I have offered my entire life for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is a problem that I know is not solved, even if I lie down on my bed, I have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is more damaging to my health than to spend hours and hours talking with those involved to help them solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To give this help becomes my joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I would rather sacrifice my life to keep the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is my destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Don t think I don t know how to take care of my health.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I had nothing to do for the Lord and were retired, I would surely take care of my health.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the churches around the world, especially the churches in the Far East, are my children, more precious even than my own children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How could I lie in bed resting, while they get drowned in the bottom of the ocean?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have to forget my health.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers, I don t encourage you to sacrifice your health, your life, but in taking care of the church life do not consider your interest first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Set your interest aside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a slogan, Safety first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I say, The church first.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And your local church first, of which you are one of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not your job, not your family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I don t mean that you shouldn t take care of your family, but I mean that the church should come first.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, brothers, I must predict that no church among us can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am pretty sure this prophecy will be fulfilled, unless you brothers who are elders sell yourselves not to the church but to the church where you serve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Always consider that church first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do, there will be no need for me to sit here talking to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will know how to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You will be able to figure out what is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we can only be the best of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot have the real testimony on the central lane of the Lord s New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pray about this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And I beg you to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the problems have come, by the Lord s mercy and with the brothers help I have borne the burden and the matters have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do realize, however, from another angle that this has been the enemy s attack, to keep me so occupied by one thing after another for the past month or so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have lost the time when I would have been working on the notes, and my body has been somewhat exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And pray for yourself, and pray for the church you take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TROUBLES AND BLESSINGS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning the ministry station, I do want you to be clear about the relations and boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we can all go on in a sweet, efficient way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is His mercy that we have so many complications.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Complications are a sign of the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Children are a trouble, and they make life complicated for the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have many children; I also have many brothers, both Chinese and American.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have also many churches and many co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means I have a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The same is true of the ministry station office.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a blessing, but it also means I have a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider, however, without this office, how could my ministry be carried out?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yes, on the one hand, it is a blessing; on the other hand, it is a trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the New Testament we know that Paul had these same complicated situations to take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My words to you are just for the carrying out of the Lord s recovery.</S>
