   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All Believers Needing to Pursue, to Seek,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and to Desire Earnestly to Prophesy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All believers should pursue, seek, and desire earnestly to prophesy 1 Cor 14:1, 12, 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Dear saints, the speaking of the Lord concerning the new way has continued in the recovery over the past five years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After hearing all this speaking, are you pursuing, seeking, and desiring earnestly to prophesy?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy, and we all should pursue, seek, and desire earnestly to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE COMPOSITION OF A PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN 1 CORINTHIANS 14 The Knowledge and Experience of God,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ, and the Spiritual Things</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The composition of a prophecy according to the way in 1 Corinthians 14 comprises, first, the knowledge and experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are going to prophesy, we must have some knowledge and experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Utterance to Speak Forth What We Know</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and Have Experienced of God,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ, and the Spiritual Things</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, the composition of a prophecy comprises the utterance to speak forth what we know and have experienced of God, Christ, and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First we need the knowledge and experience; then we need the utterance, that is, the word and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can compose a brief prophecy and then practice speaking it to ourselves at home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may even speak it to ourselves ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After speaking it several times, we will know how to correct and improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through this kind of practice, we will have the proper utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Sight under the Divine Enlightenment</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>concerning the Situation</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and Environment in Which We Are</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The composition of a prophecy also comprises the sight under the divine enlightenment concerning the situation and environment in which we are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many among us are not clear about the intrinsic contents of the present turmoil in the Lord's recovery, and some prefer not to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their attitude is that others should be clear about the situation, but that they should take care only of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such an attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is our home and our family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is a turmoil in our home among our family, we cannot say, "I do not want to know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I simply want to enjoy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must have the sight to see the things taking place among us and the situation of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we cannot see clearly, we need to pray, "Lord, show me the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Shine over me and enlighten me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Give me the full enlightenment that I may know the intrinsic contents of the present situation."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must know what is happening in the church, not so that we may take sides with one group of saints against another, but so that we may know the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Instant Inspiration of the Indwelling</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spirit That Stirs Up Our Spirit to Speak</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The knowledge and the experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things, the utterance to speak forth what we know and have experienced, and a clear view concerning our situation and environment are the basic preparation for our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In addition, we need the instant inspiration of the indwelling Spirit that stirs up our spirit to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are different from the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament, the saints did not have the abiding Spirit indwelling them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They had to wait until the Spirit came upon them before they could speak for the Lord 2 Chron 15:1; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the New Testament says, "The Lord be with your spirit" 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not need the Spirit to come upon us, because we always have Him in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we should not wait for the Spirit to come upon us; rather, we should exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit who is indwelling our spirit will be moved by us, and we will have the inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not He who moves us, but it is we who move the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we remain clear with the Lord by confessing our failures, we will have a direct, open fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is in our spirit, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we come to the meeting, we need only to exercise our spirit and say, "Lord Jesus, I want to speak."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then He will rise up, and we can speak according to our experience with the utterance we have gained and with the enlightenment that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do this, everyone will have something to speak in the Lord's Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to practice composing a prophecy according to the way in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To help us in this matter, we have prepared the book The Holy Word for Morning Revival.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we use the contents of this book with the knowledge and experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things, the utterance to speak forth what we know and have experienced, the sight under the divine enlightenment concerning our situation, and the instant inspiration of the indwelling Spirit through the clear and open fellowship with the Lord in the exercise of our spirit, we can easily compose a prophecy and speak it in the church meeting.</S>
