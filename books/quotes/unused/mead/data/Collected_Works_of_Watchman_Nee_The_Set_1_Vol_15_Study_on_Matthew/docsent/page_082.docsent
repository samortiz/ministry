   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 9:"And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word "father" here does not refer to the father in a family but to a father in the church, one who is in authority, such as the "fathers" in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The following "Father...who is in the heavens" proves that the "father" here denotes a religious father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unfortunately, by the second century the church fathers had come into being in the church; these were actually the disciples of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 10:"Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An instructor is less honorable than a rabbi; it refers to a religious person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be called a rabbi is a great thing, and one should never accept such a title.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord has ordained that we call one another brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 11:"And the greatest among you shall be your servant."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the second time the Lord mentioned this matter see Matt 20:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The principle here is most important.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be genuinely great does not depend on fame, position, or title; it depends only on whether one can work and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 12:"And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To humble oneself is a self-initiated humbling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person does not need to wait until he is despised by others; he should be without vainglory in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 23:13-33 mentions seven woes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 14 is found only in some ancient manuscripts and does not have sufficient support from the authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first through fourth woes belong to one category, and the fifth through seventh woes belong to another category.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 13:"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For you close off the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said woe only to the scribes and Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not say woe to the sinners, the harlots, the tax collectors, the Sadducees the modernists , and the Herodians traitors .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because the woe of the latter group of people is obvious; even the women and the young ones all know it, and it is not worth describing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the Pharisees and scribes were like the respectable ones in the church; people think that they should receive a reward and a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the Lord specifically exposed their real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"You close off the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The kingdom of the heavens refers to a spiritual realm; it signifies the genuine church on the earth, the corporate entity that loves the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Pharisees and scribes prevented people from believing in Jesus; their unrighteousness stumbled others, and their erroneous teachings caused others to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 15:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They proselytized Gentiles to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They zealously preached and declared that the Gentiles who worshipped idols would perish, and that they ought to worship the only true God, who created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After these Gentiles entered into Judaism and became proselytes, the Pharisees and scribes could not nurture them, nor could they testify anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, they brought in their original wickedness in addition to the wickedness of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, they became "twice as much a son of Gehenna."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verses 16-17:"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fools and blind men, which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These were the laws they added, that is, that the gold is greater than the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason they prized gold as greater was because gold is valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verses 18-19:"And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift which is upon it, he is bound.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Blind men, which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifies the gift?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Pharisees considered the gift as greater than the altar because they were for the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the Lord said that the temple and the altar were greater because they sanctified the gold and the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here the Lord shows us the teaching related to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be sanctified is not to uproot the root of sin, as in pulling out a painful tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, what would both the gold and the gift pull out?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be sanctified means to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are gold and gifts everywhere, but those that are separated unto God are sanctified, and no one can touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the same with the sanctification of the believers; to be sanctified is to be separated from among men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are two sanctifications, which are typified by the temple and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The temple typifies Christ Matt 12:6; John 2:21 , and the gold in the temple typifies our abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The altar typifies consecration, the consecration after being saved, which is to be separated for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verses 20-22:"Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all the things upon it; and he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These verses point out how their laws were hypocritical and without foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verses 23-24:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But these you should have done and not neglected the others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The following three woes speak of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They kept the ordinance of the law in vain and had no heart to walk in justice, mercy, and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They would strain out the smallest gnat from their food, but would swallow a camel without feeling anything.</S>
