   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: Before we are about to speak, may the Lord give us the anointing in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, the more we fellowship with You, the more we feel that we are filthy and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We pray that we may be able to speak forth everything that You want us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Your presence is with the church, there is light, and men will touch You when they come in.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BEING THE DEFINITE CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Among all the passages in the Bible, Romans 12:1 and 2 speak of consecration in a most explicit, thorough, precise, and definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This passage deals with consecration in a most emphatic and serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many brothers and sisters have heard the subject of consecration before.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when Romans 12 speaks of consecration, it mentions at least three practical things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, there may be more than three things, but at least there are three.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Tonight, we will only speak concerning two of these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The consecration spoken of here is too precise, definite, and explicit; there is no way for anyone to avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other places, consecration may not be as definite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the consecration spoken of here is very definite.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes, when you ask others if they have consecrated themselves, they may say that they have done so.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when you look at these ones, they do not look like consecrated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of consecration is too abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The consecration spoken of here is the consecration of the bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people have changed the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They tell others to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But here it says that we have to consecrate our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why does it speak of the bodies?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because the body is the most definite and practical thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Paul were to tell us to consecrate the heart or the soul, it would not have been so definite.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most definite thing is the consecration of our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man has brought his heart and his mind here, is that person here yet?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not necessarily here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if his body is here, he is definitely here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I ask whether or not you have consecrated your heart, everyone can raise up his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some have consecrated their hearts, but they have not consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The desire of consecration has to spread from the heart to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is like sickness which spreads from within a person to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With those who have only consecrated themselves in an inward way, their consecrations are intangible and impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only those who have consecrated their bodies are practical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the only place in the whole Bible that speaks of the presenting of our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The heart is abstract, and it is intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only the body is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother Suen, what is your consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is it a consecration of the heart or of the body?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consecration is a familiar subject.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many may have been bored by the subject already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this is the first time you have heard about the consecration of our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The consecration of the heart can be haphazard, deceiving, and misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the consecration of the bodies is as definite as a piece of rock; it is something that a person can touch.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I were to ask if you have consecrated yourself, you might be able to answer "yes" with confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if I were to ask if you have consecrated your body, what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brother Suen said that part of it has been consecrated and part of it has not been consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Miss Hsiao and Miss Kao, both of you have been Christians for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have your bodies been consecrated yet?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are like the students who have not done their homework properly and who need to have make-up lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have not settled the question of the consecration of our bodies, we have not yet settled the question of consecration at all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Both the New Testament and the Old Testament speak of consecration many times.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But Romans 12 alone speaks of it in a most definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people love the Lord in their hearts, but they have not dropped the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Heart consecration is the preacher's consecration, whereas body consecration is the consecration according to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is much more definite and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you have it, you have it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do not have it, you do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many brothers and sisters say that their consecrations are not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have so many brothers and sisters with incomplete consecrations!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This shows that their consecration has never spread from their heart to their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Tonight I am not preaching a sermon here.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am presenting to you a visible, tangible, and touchable matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Have you consecrated yourself or not?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If our bodies are not consecrated, we have not yet taken a start in our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At least one place in the Bible speaks explicitly of the consecration of our bodies.</S>
