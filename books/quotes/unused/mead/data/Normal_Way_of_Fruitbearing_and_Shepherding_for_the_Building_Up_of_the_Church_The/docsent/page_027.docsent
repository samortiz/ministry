   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT PRACTICAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING SHEPHERDING Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:7, 11; 2 Cor 12:15; 1 Cor 4:14-15 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST To Be Built Up Requiring Us to Deal</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>with Our Peculiarities</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we saw in the previous chapter, the main thing we need in the church service is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because most Christians do not realize the need for building, Christianity today is mainly a group of organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A building is not merely a collection of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The true nature of the building of God is indicated by Ephesians 4:16, which says, All the Body, being joined together and being knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the materials in a building eventually lose their individual identification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each piece loses its own peculiarity, and every piece becomes the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A house, for example, is built with many materials.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before each individual, separate, and particular item is built into the house, it is easy to identify because it has its own peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be built up, therefore, is to deal with and be delivered from our peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever is in us that is peculiar needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not wish to speak concerning this matter in a mere doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do this, we will only repeat the tragic history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of the dear saints in the Lord s recovery have the concept that the recovery will grow in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can easily hire laborers to pile up materials in a quick way, but we cannot produce a proper building very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same way, the Lord s recovery cannot advance quickly, because it is a building, not a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we desire to build up a movement, we can do it quickly, but this will simply be a repetition of the failures of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to repeat this history.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, we desire to see the saints grow in life and increase in number in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not desire to see a piling up of materials; we desire to see the genuine building up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be built up is to have our peculiarity dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Maintaining a Proper Order in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>under the Headship of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition, every building is something vertical, not only horizontal, and the most useful buildings are the tallest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We human beings were not created flat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only Satan, the serpent, is flat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In principle, every worldly society is a flat serpent, creeping on the dirty earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even some of the saints in the Lord s recovery still hold to the concept that the church is flat, that is, that everyone has the same place in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we try to make everyone the same in this way, we will turn the church into a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A body is not only horizontal but also vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For a man to stand vertically indicates that he is strong, but when he is tired, he sits down, and when he is worn out, he lies down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, when a person is dead, his body lies flat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Too many dear saints still desire the Body to be flat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything vertical is useful, but whatever is only horizontal loses most of its usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To pull down the pieces of a building and lay them horizontally renders them useless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To build up something is to cause it to rise up vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more vertical a local church is, the stronger it is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything that is vertical must have a proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord does not set the members in His Body too high or too low.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, He has set us all in the proper place 1 Cor 12:18, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we all remain where we are placed, we will be in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To say that the church is the Body of Christ with the function of all the members does not mean that the members have the same place in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a thing would not be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our physical body, the feet are on the bottom and the head is on top.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The feet cannot say, Head, you are too high; you need to come down.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us all be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Neither can the head say, Feet, you are too low.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please come up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We hate hierarchy in the church, but we appreciate the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our whole body depends on the head.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may say that a body stands on its feet, but if we would cut off its head, the feet would no longer function.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For our body to stand depends very little on the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It depends mainly on the head to hold it up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without the headship, we lose the heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The term to head up is not our invention.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Ephesians 1:10 the apostle Paul says, To head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In God s creation there was a good order, but by the fall that order was destroyed and humanity became flat, without the proper headship.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From that time until the present and beyond, what God is doing is heading up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today Christ is our Head, which implies the headship, the authority of the Head over the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is the headship of the Head that heads up and holds the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we lose the Head, we have no headship, and the Body collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In our physical body, every member has its own place in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The arm is under the shoulder, the hand is under the arm, and the fingers are under the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This kind of order maintains the headship, and it is the keeping of the headship that makes the members useful.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once a member loses its position, it is out from under the headship, it is out of function, and it is out of the proper building up.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is the problems related to the headship that keep the churches in the Lord s recovery from advancing very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many of us have a wrong understanding of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the Lord opens our eyes to see what the proper building is, we will see how short we are of the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the one hand, Christianity throughout the past centuries has rendered much help to us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even today we are standing on the shoulders of many who have gone before us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the other hand, Christianity has influenced us in a negative way, and it is very difficult today to lose this influence.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we all mean business with the Lord, we should have a thorough dealing with the Lord, saying, Lord, from today I would drop all the doctrinal knowledge, teaching, and practices that I picked up in Christianity and remain in the spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do this, we will be different persons, and our concept will be fully revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the building there must be the proper vertical order.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Without the proper order, nothing can be built up, and we cannot be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is exactly what the enemy desires.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As long as we do not have the building, it makes no difference to him how many meetings we have or how large a crowd we draw.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Roman Catholic Church today has many millions of people all over the world, but since it is the same in principle as any great secular movement in the world, the Lord has no use for it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What the Lord needs is the genuine building.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, we must all pray, look to the Lord for His mercy, and tell Him, Lord, I need to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This will spontaneously cause us to be radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Those outside the churches do not realize what we are doing here, and they speak all manner of things about us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They understand us only according to what they are and what they practice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Nevertheless, if the Lord has mercy upon us, we will have the proper building up among us.</S>
