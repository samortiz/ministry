He has given us grace. He is the true and living God! When I pass out gospel tracts on the street, many people come over to ask for them as if they are asking for something precious. May the Lord give them grace so that they may gain comfort from those words. One day, while a few brothers and sisters were praying with me, we saw a short slip of paper before our eyes. The first sentence said, "Fear not...I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" (Gen. 15:1). The second sentence said, "He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him" (Prov. 30:5). Hallelujah! Thank and praise the Lord! We knelt down and prayed for the brothers and sisters in each locality. Please remember the unbelievers here in your prayers. If the Lord allows, perhaps I will return home for a period of time. Please pray much for the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao. Please order seven copies of The Open Door for us. Peace in the Lord! Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow from all the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao. Greetings to Mrs. Luan.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tze-jieh<br />January 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>X in the Lord:</p><p>I have not written you for a long time. I have often wanted to write, but I did not know what to write, so I have put it off until today. Thank the Lord! I read the last little paragraph of The Open Door today and found out that you were happy to hear our news, so I am writing this letter. Thank the Lord! Praise the Lord! He is the never-changing Lord! He will never forget those whom He loves! I am very unworthy, but it does not matter. When I was in Ling-Zi, I heard the rumors of war getting worse and worse every day. But thank the Lord, His doings are truly marvelous because He allowed me to do some work in Guang-Rao during that time. Outwardly I was helping people, but inwardly I was edified myself.</p><p>On December 4 Mrs. Shen and Mrs. Yuan Ling-shu safely arrived in Tsingtao with their daughters. Thank the Lord for edifying us every day. The Lord gave me the word in 2 Timothy 2:22 before I left. Since my arrival, it has been wonderful for us to be able to pray in one accord daily. May the Lord grant us grace upon grace. Peace in the Lord. Greetings to Sister Chang and Sister Wang. I received a letter dated January 1 from a brother in Ling-Zi saying that the county seat of Guang-Rao has been captured by bandits. Since Guang-Rao was lost, Ling-Zi is nervous. May the Lord preserve those who believe in Him in those two places.</p><p>Jing Sin-nai<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise God for allowing the brothers and sisters in Tientsin to read The Open Door. We have received both the first and second issues and have passed them out to the brothers and sisters. Most of the brothers and sisters are living at temporary addresses. They move or leave Tientsin constantly. Communication by mail is also difficult, so the responsible brothers will subscribe for the brothers and sisters and distribute them accordingly. This way the publications will not be lost, and the saints in Hankow will be spared much trouble. Is this all right with you? (It is very good&mdash;Editor.) I am enclosing an order form for a total of eighty copies. I am wiring X dollars through the Bank of China for the Lord's work and the publication costs. Some was collected from the offering box for the work in Hankow, and some is local offerings for the expansion of the Lord's work in general. Please determine how it should be distributed. Let me give a little report of the assembly in Tientsin: Our address is still 82 Alley 6 Yao-Hua-Li, British Concession 21 Road, Tientsin. Thank and praise the Lord. Our meetings have continued as usual since the beginning of the war; we have not had to cancel even one meeting. Our meetings include edification meetings, gospel meetings, table meetings, prayer meetings, and Bible studies. Although we can grow cold and change, the Lord who loves us will never change; He will love us to the end. He manifests His wisdom, power, grace, mercy, and love to His children all the time. Truly, "Had we ten thousand thousand tongues, our theme of joy's but one!" Praise and thank our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! The brothers and sisters are all well and safe in the Lord. Please do not worry. There are, however, a few who have lost their jobs. Please remember us in your prayers. We also hope that God's workers will come here often. May the Lord be with you until He comes. Peace and joy to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord! Amen.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Lee Bih, Sia Si-ling<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> </body></html>
