   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outline The processed God Becoming a life-giving Spirit A definite process Christ and the Spirit being one Christ as the indwelling Spirit Christ never leaving the believers Text</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 15:45b is one of the most crucial verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The "last Adam" refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "became" implies that a process has taken place for Him to be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, if you ask people who God is, some will say that He is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others may say that He is also our Redeemer and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not many will say that God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the Spirit, God is not simple, for He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Spirit includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Spirit is the all-inclusive compound Spirit we saw in the previous lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. THE PROCESSED GOD A. Becoming a Life-Giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In eternity past God existed alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, in time, He created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At a certain point in history, this creating God, the Creator of all, became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This crucial step is called incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By means of incarnation, God put on man with all of creation, for man is the head of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus, God incarnate, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was crucified, all creation was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that not only did Christ go to the cross, but the very man God had put on Himself with the entire creation went to the cross with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Christ's death on the cross was an all-inclusive crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After His crucifixion, Christ was buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The man and the creation which were crucified with Christ were also buried in that tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After three days, Christ arose from the dead in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through resurrection and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, in His ascension to the third heaven, He was crowned and became the Head and the Lord over all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He descended upon His Body as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because God, after completing the work of creation, passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, we may speak of Him as the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The diagram portrays the process through which He has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Process of the Divine Economy</S>
