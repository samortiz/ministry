        <h2 class="head2">Smelling</h2>
<p>The second characteristic of the dead is that they smell. John 11 says that Lazarus was dead and also smelled (v. 39). When someone dies, he smells; that is, he has the odor of death. The odor of death is hard to describe, but it exists. There is an odor of death. If you come into contact with a dead man, you will smell the odor of death. Likewise, you may contact a relative or friend whose conduct, words, and expressions have a certain odor. This proves that he is dead. He is so dead that he smells. He has the fact of death and the odor of death. He has death, and he also emits the odor of death.</p>
<p>Someone who tells stories about his sins is dead and has the odor of death. The more he speaks, the more excited he becomes. However, when I hear such a person speak, I am grieved and smell an odor of death. Telling stories about our sins proves that we are dead in sins. We are so dead that we emit a bad odor. As soon as we open our mouth to tell stories about our sins, others can smell the odor of death.</p>
<p>You may wonder why you cannot smell the odor of death. You cannot smell it because you also are dead. You also have the odor of death; hence, you cannot smell the odor of death in others. Most people in northern China love to eat garlic, and there is usually an odor of garlic in their mouth. Some people cannot tolerate this smell of garlic, but if they ate some garlic, they would not smell garlic in others. If you eat garlic and then contact others who eat garlic, you will not smell the odor of garlic. This is because you also have the odor of garlic. There are many obscene things in the newspapers and many disgusting advertisements, but people do not sense that these things are filthy; they cannot smell the odor of death in them. This shows that people are dead and are soaked with the odor of death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Buried</h2>
<p>The third characteristic of the dead is that they are buried. The Gospel of John says that Lazarus was buried in a tomb. After someone dies, he needs to be buried. To be buried means to be trapped in a certain thing and unable to get out. To be buried means to fall into a situation and to be unable to get out through one&rsquo;s own efforts. People in the world are buried in their lusts and addictions. Some are buried in their eating and drinking. Some are buried in fornication and gambling. Some are buried in movie theaters and dance clubs. These places are their tombs. Everyone has a tomb in which he is trapped and buried. What is your tomb? Are you also helplessly trapped in something?</p>
<p>Lazarus was dead and had been buried for four days. Some people, however, have been buried in their addictions for decades. Some people have been buried for half their lives in casinos and cannot come out. Some people have been buried in dance clubs and cannot come out. These situations prove that people are inwardly dead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Bound</h2>
<p>The fourth characteristic of the dead is that they are bound. Whether in China or in other places, the dead are not only buried; they are also bound. The Gospel of John says that Lazarus was bound hand and foot with cloths in the tomb (v. 44). To be buried means that someone is trapped. To be bound means that someone is unable to move, having no freedom. If you want to know whether people in the world are dead, check whether they are free to move. People in the world are not free; rather, their whole being is bound. Some are bound by their lusts, and others are bound by their addictions. Regardless of the kind of bondage, man has no freedom, and man cannot break away from the source of bondage. This also proves that man is dead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE DEAD</h2>
<p>These characteristics of death prove that man is dead. Let us consider the need of the dead. Do the dead need healing? Healing is useless. Do the dead need correction? Correction is also useless. The need of the dead is the resurrection life, because their problem is death. Healing cannot deal with death, and correction cannot deal with death. Only resurrection life can deal with death. Therefore, the dead need a life that can enter into and enliven them. This is the basic need of the dead.</p>
<p>When Lazarus was sick, his sisters sent a message to the Lord Jesus, hoping that the Lord would come to heal him. They asked the Lord to heal Lazarus. However, when the Lord Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, He remained in the place where He was for two more days. Because of the delay, Lazarus had been dead for four days when the Lord arrived. The Lord Jesus delayed in order to show that His salvation raises people out of death instead of just solving their outward problems. For this reason, He did not go to save Lazarus until he was dead. If He had gone to heal Lazarus, His salvation would not have been presented in a proper way. It would have meant that His salvation merely &ldquo;corrects&rdquo; people. Healing is in the principle of correction, but resurrection is in the principle of regeneration. To heal is to correct a problem; it is a matter of behavior. To resurrect is to give life; it is a matter of life. The Gospel of John presents eight cases to portray the principles of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The greatest principle of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is to raise people out of death. Therefore, the Lord waited until Lazarus had died instead of healing him while he was sick. This shows that resurrection is the principle of salvation. Resurrection is the true need of those who are dead in sins.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is to raise people from the dead, not to correct their problems. Hence, when Lazarus was sick, the Lord did not go to heal him. The Lord did not do anything. This means that if we merely acknowledge that we have problems but not that we are dead, the Lord will be unable to carry out His salvation in us. If we feel that merely our conduct needs to be corrected but not that we need the resurrection of life, the Lord will be unable to carry out His salvation in us. We must see that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not to heal or correct us but to raise us from death and to give life to us. Our problem is not that there is something wrong with our conduct but that there is something wrong with our life. We are not only sick; we are dead. The need of the dead is to receive life in order to be resurrected. The only cure for death is resurrection life. Only resurrection life can eliminate death. The cultivation of one&rsquo;s character and the correction of one&rsquo;s conduct cannot eliminate death.</p>
<p>A funeral home modifies the appearance of dead people. However, a person is still dead, regardless of how much his appearance is modified. Make-up can be applied to him so that he looks very nice, but he will still be dead. A funeral home cannot bring the dead back to life or raise them from death. The work in a funeral home cannot solve the problem of the dead; that is not what the dead need. The dead need life and resurrection instead of modification and correction. Modification and correction cannot solve the problem of the dead. The problem of the dead is death. Only life and resurrection can eliminate death. Therefore, the dead need life and resurrection.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
