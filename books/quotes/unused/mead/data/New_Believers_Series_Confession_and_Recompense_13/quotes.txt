[1]  CONFESSION AND RECOMPENSE Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-7; Matt 5:23-26 I. A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENSE
[2]  After we have believed in the Lord, we must build up a habit of confessing and recompensing.
[3]  If we have offended anyone or have come short of anyone, we should learn to confess or to recompense.
[4]  On the one hand, we have to confess to God, and on the other hand, we have to confess to and recompense man.
[5]  If a man does not confess to God nor apologize or recompense man, his conscience will easily become hardened.
[6]  Leviticus 6:2-7: "When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah," All sins are ultimately trespasses against Jehovah "and lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit or a security, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his fellowman, or has found what was lost and lied about it, and has sworn falsely concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty.
[7]  Our manner of life has to be righteous, and our conscience must be void of offense before God.
[8]  God's Word says, "Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery" v. 4 . The word return is very important.
[9]  Matthew 5:23-26 says, "Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
[10]  Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
[11]  If you are offering a gift at the altar, that is, if you are offering something to God, and suddenly remember that your brother has something against you, this remembering is God's leading.
[12]  When you have offended and transgressed against your brother, when he is disturbed and feels that you are unrighteous, and when you have caused him to sigh before God, your spiritual fellowship with God is interrupted; your spiritual prospects are gone.
[13]  You may not have the slightest feeling that you are in darkness, and you may feel that you are all right, but the gift you offer at the altar has become void.
[14]  First, the scope of your confession should be as wide as the scope of your offense.
