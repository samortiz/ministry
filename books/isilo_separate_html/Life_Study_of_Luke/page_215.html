The word &ldquo;triune&rdquo; means three-one. Hence, God is the three-one God. Because He is triune, three-one, we should not think that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit can be separated. We need to always remember that the Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are one. However, while They are one, They are three at the same time.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Consummation of the Triune God</h2><p>In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection the Spirit came as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. When the Son came in incarnation, He came with the Father and by the Spirit. After coming in incarnation, the Son took a further step to go through death and enter into resurrection. This is the process which we call the Man-Savior&rsquo;s transfiguration. By going through this process of transfiguration, the Son, who came in incarnation with the Father and by the Spirit, became the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. We should not think that when the Spirit came He came alone, leaving the Son and the Father on the throne in heaven. No, when the Spirit came He came as the consummation of the Triune God. This means that when the Spirit came, the Son and Father came with Him also. The three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;came together as the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Elements Brought into the Life-giving Spirit<br />through the Man-Savior&rsquo;s Transfiguration</h2><p>Furthermore, when God came through incarnation, something was added to Him&mdash;the element of humanity. Before the incarnation, the Son of God was merely divine; He did not have the human nature. But when He came through incarnation, humanity was added to Him. In this way He became a God-man, a Person both divine and human.</p><p>This God-man experienced human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death. We have seen that the Man-Savior died as One with a sevenfold status. His death was the death of the Lamb of God, a serpent in form, a grain of wheat, the last Adam, the Firstborn of all creation, a man in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and the Peacemaker. Because of the Lord&rsquo;s sevenfold status in His death, it was an all-inclusive death.</p><p>After this God-man passed through His all-inclusive death, He entered into resurrection. His resurrection was His transfiguration&mdash;the transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers. This transfiguration included a number of elements: humanity, human living, and Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death. All these elements were brought into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who became the consummation of the Triune God. Just as the incarnation added humanity to God, so the Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection brought all these elements into the life-giving Spirit.</p><p>Some may argue that nothing can be added to God. But I would ask you to look at what is portrayed in the New Testament. When God became a man, was not humanity added to Him? Incarnation was a process that brought God into humanity and added humanity to God. In like manner, resurrection as the Man-Savior&rsquo;s transfiguration was also a process that brought the elements of humanity, human living, and the all-inclusive death of the God-man with His sevenfold status into the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_214.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_216.html">Next</a> </body></html>
