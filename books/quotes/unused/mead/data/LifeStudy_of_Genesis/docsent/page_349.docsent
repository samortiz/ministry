   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>8 The Offering of Isaac a Abraham Tested by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the original text of the Bible, there are no chapters, verses, or paragraphs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter twenty-two is the immediate continuation of chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the mention of Abraham's planting a tamarisk tree and calling on the name of the Lord, God came in to test him v. 1, Heb . God, unlike Satan, never tempts anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But He does test us like He tested Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I say again that after Abraham redeemed the well in Beer-sheba, he undoubtedly did many things, but, except for the planting of the tamarisk and calling on the name of the Lord, the Bible does not mention them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it immediately speaks of God's testing Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 To Offer to God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What God Has Given Him in Grace</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Often after we have had the best enjoyment of the Lord, He will not ask us to do something for Him; rather, He will tell us to offer back to Him what He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At such a time the Lord may say, "You have received a gift from and of Me. Now I ask you to return it." We always expect that after having a good time with the Lord He will command us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We never imagine that He may ask us to give back to Him that which He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Abraham was enjoying intimate fellowship with God, he was not commanded to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He received the highest demand from God to give back to God what God had given him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the very beginning, God never accepted anything that Abraham had.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not care for Lot, rejected Eliezer, and told him to cast out Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now, after Eliezer, Lot, and Ishmael had all been rejected, Abraham had acquired Isaac, the seed promised by God, and was at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything concerning Isaac was of God and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Never again would God say no to what Abraham had.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But suddenly God came in and seemed to say, "I would never refuse Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was born of and from Me. But, Abraham, now you must give him back to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I had been he, I would have said, "Lord, what are You doing?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You did not care for Lot, and You have refused Eliezer and Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now You want Isaac, the one who was of You, to be given back to You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Will You rob me to such an extent?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I had been Abraham, I would not have offered Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would have shook my head and said, "No, this certainly is not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It would have been logical for Him to want Eliezer, and reasonable to demand Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But how could God want me to give Isaac back to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is not purposeless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He promised to give me a seed, and His promise has been confirmed and fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why would He now waste all that He has been doing with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, God is a God of purpose, and He certainly had a purpose in asking Abraham to give Isaac back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians, including some Christian workers, have never learned the lesson of offering back to God what He has given them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you received a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not hold on to it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sooner or later God will come in and say, "Offer back to Me the gift which I have given you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Has God given you a successful work?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At a certain time, God may say, "This work is the Isaac which I have given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now I want you to offer it back to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, many Christian workers will not take their hands off the work which God has given them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, all that God has given us, even what He has wrought in and through us, must be offered back to Him.</S>
