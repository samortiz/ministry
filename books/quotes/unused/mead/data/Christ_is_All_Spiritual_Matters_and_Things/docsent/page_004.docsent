   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IS THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord said that He is the way and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then He said that He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have mentioned briefly what it is for Christ to be the way and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we have to speak some concerning Christ being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Wherever there is life, spontaneously there are works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But works cannot replace life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to be very clear that works are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Life does not require any effort of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Life is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people try hard and exert considerable energy to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Daily they strive toward this goal to the point of exhaustion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To them, the doctrines are strict; one has to be humble, meek, loving, forgiving, and enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These teachings are truly tiresome.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They consider it a hard thing to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is especially true for young Christians, who find that the harder they try, the harder it is for them to live like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, if Christ is not the life, we surely have to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if Christ is the life, we do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me repeat: life is Christ Himself, and works cannot replace life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among God s children, the greatest misunderstanding is to think that self-effort is life and that unless one exerts his own effort, he does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we have to realize that if there is life, there is no need of work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is life, everything will be lived out spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider how your eyes see.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consider how your ears hear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your eyes see spontaneously, and your ears hear spontaneously because they all have life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life is so spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must be clear that where life is, spontaneously there are works.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, works cannot replace life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some works on the contrary prove the absence of life, or they prove that the life is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it is life, it will surely result in good moral behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But good moral behavior cannot take the place of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a brother is very gentle; he does not speak much, and he is neither too soft nor too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some brothers may say, This brother has quite a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But these brothers have actually used the wrong words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said, I am the life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the brother may be gentle and quiet, his behavior is not life unless it issues from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can only say that he has a good temper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You can only say that he does not cause much trouble, or that he treats others politely, that he does not argue or quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But you cannot say that this man has a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You cannot say that what he has issues from Christ, because what he has is natural; it is not life, and it is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people hold to another concept.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They think that life is power, and the Lord being their life means that the Lord gives them power to make them do good, behave well, and be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They think that this is life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God has shown us that power is not a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our power is Christ; it is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our power is not a drive to accomplish something; our power is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our life is not only a power, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is Christ manifesting Himself from us, not us utilizing Christ to manifest the goodness that we desire to have.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These two things are absolutely different, and we must distinguish between them clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One brother went to meet in a place, and an elderly Christian asked him, Why did you go to that place to meet?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brother answered, Because that place has life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elderly man asked, Is our place not as noisy as the other place?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brother responded, No, it is not noisy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The elderly man said, What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If it is not noisy, how can it have life?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brother answered, It is not at all exciting, yet it has life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Life is not excitement; it is not emotional stimulation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Life is not a warm atmosphere or loud noise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The elderly man said, Perhaps young people like excitement, but my preference is for thoughtful messages.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever I hear a thoughtful message, I touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To me this is life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The young brother replied, I have also heard the kind of thoughtful messages that you speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I did not touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers and sisters, this conversation shows us that life is not emotional stimulations, good thoughts, wise words, clever words, logical words, or thoughtful words.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these may not be life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some may say, This is strange.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If life is not excitement and it is not thoughtful messages, what is life?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What do you consider as life?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We admit that we cannot describe life with any better words.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can only say that there is something deeper than feelings and deeper than thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we touch this something, we become enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This something is life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, what is life?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Life is something deeper than the thoughts; thoughts cannot be compared with life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Life is something deeper than feelings; feelings cannot be compared to life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thoughts and feelings are outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What then is life?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord said, I am...the life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One does not meet life when he walks into some excited atmosphere or some spiritually charged environment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have to ask what is the source of such an atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Experience tells us that many people who are very good at creating a noisy atmosphere know very little about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many excitable people know very little about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ is life; nothing else is life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to learn to know life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Life is not a matter of excitement or thoughtful ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Life is an expression of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Nothing can be compared to our knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whenever we know the Lord, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have to realize before the Lord what it means for Christ to be life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Those who are excitable or who are smart are not necessarily the ones who know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But when there is a group of people who know the Lord in a particular way, who know what the Lord is like, their spiritual discernment of the Lord and their knowledge of the Lord will tell them that Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we have such discernment and knowledge, we will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we know that the Lord is life, we will realize that in spiritual matters, natural energy is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we know the Lord as life, we will look to Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we first believed in the Lord, we did not know what it meant to look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But after we have learned some lessons, we begin to look to Him more and more, because we know that everything depends on Christ and not on us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we first became Christians, we were after individual things, and we did not trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After we learned some lessons, we began to understand a little and began to realize that we have to learn to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Trusting in the Lord does not mean trusting in Him for individual things, but trusting in Him to do what we cannot do in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we first became Christians, we felt that we had to do something, and that unless we did something, things would fall apart, and everything would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We always tried to do everything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But after we find out that Christ is our life, we realize that everything depends on Christ and not on our working.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Then we learn to rest and to look to Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Brothers and sisters, we must remember that God does not give us individual things, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He has given us His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should always lift up our head and say to the Lord, You are my way; You are my truth; You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Lord, I have to deal with You alone, not with the things that belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Brothers and sisters, may the Lord be gracious to us and show us that spiritual matters are nothing but the Lord, that spiritual matters are nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Day by day, we have to realize that it is wrong for the way to be something that is apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is wrong for the truth to be something that is apart from Christ, and it is wrong for the life to be something that is apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Yet how easy it is for us to take the way, the truth, and the life as separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We call a noisy atmosphere life.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We call clear logic life.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We call rich emotions life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We call outward behavior life.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Actually, they are not life at all.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We have to know that the Lord is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It is the Lord who lives out this life from us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>May the Lord deliver us from many fragmentary, outward matters so that we can touch the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>May we see the Lord in everything, and may we see that our way is our knowledge of the Lord, our truth is our knowledge of the Lord, and our life is our knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>May the Lord open our eyes, and may we be delivered from many outward things to see the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>May we live in Him, and may He live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Amen!</S>
