   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 9:20-27; Lev 10:1-2; Num 12:1-15; 16 THE REBELLION OF HAM The Failure of the Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being a Test to Those Submitting to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first garden, Adam fell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the second garden, Noah also fell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God saved Noah's household because of his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's plan, Noah was the head of his household.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God placed Noah's family under his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God also set Noah to be the head of the earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But one day Noah drank of the wine of the vineyard and became drunk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He became naked in the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When his son Ham saw his father's nakedness, he went out and told his two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As far as his conduct was concerned, Noah was wrong; he should not have been drunk.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Ham did not see the seriousness of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The father is the authority set up by God in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the flesh loves to see authority exposed to shame so that there can be freedom from restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Ham saw the impropriety of his father, there was no sense of shame or sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He also did not think of covering the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This proves that he had a spirit of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He went out to tell his brothers and expose the shame of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This proves that he also had a reviling conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But notice how Shem and Japheth dealt with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They went into the tent backward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They did not turn their faces toward their father's shame; instead, they covered their father with the garment on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The failure of Noah became a test to Shem, Ham, Japheth, and Canaan the son of Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It showed who was submissive and who was rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Noah's failure exposed Ham's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Noah woke up from his drunkenness, he prophesied that the descendant of Ham would be cursed and that he would be a servant of servants to his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first slave in the Bible is Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The phrase "Canaan shall be his servant" is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that those who do not submit to authority will have to be slaves, being subject to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Shem was blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus was born of the descendants of Shem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those of Japheth are the preachers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the nations that preach the gospel are descendants of Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the flood, the first person who was cursed was Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His descendants were made to be slaves under others' authority for generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone who learns to serve the Lord must come face-to-face with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He cannot serve God in a spirit of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>NADAB AND ABIHU OFFERING STRANGE FIRE The Reason for Devouring</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How solemn is the story of Nadab and Abihu!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They became priests because they belonged to the house of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was due to the proper condition of their house before God; it was not due to the proper condition of the individuals in that house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God appointed Aaron to be the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The anointing was upon the head of Aaron Lev 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In all things related to offerings and service, the chief person was Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His sons were just helpers taking orders from him to attend to the affairs beside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God had no intention for Aaron's sons to be priests independently.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He only wanted them to be under Aaron's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Leviticus 8 refers to Aaron and his sons twelve times.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then chapter nine indicates that Aaron offered the sacrifices while his sons helped alongside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If Aaron did not move, his sons should not have moved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything should have been under Aaron's name.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nothing should have been under his sons' names.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When his sons assumed the headship presumptuously to offer sacrifices, it became strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, thought that they also could offer sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without Aaron's command, they offered up strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The meaning of strange fire is to serve God while refusing to take orders and disregarding authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They observed that it was a simple matter for their father to offer sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nothing extraordinary seemed to be involved; therefore, they thought that they could do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, they took the matter into their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their only consideration was whether or not the matter could be done.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They did not consider the matter of God's authority.</S>
