   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, release our spirit, give us the burden, and enable us to receive the burden and to stretch out our hands in faith to touch Your throne of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we believe that Your church needs the land in Lin-ko.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank You for blessing Taiwan because of Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We still ask You to pour out Your blessing in so many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Bless this country, bless the government, and bless the officials.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Give them the wisdom to make the right decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Cause them to have a deep realization that this decision is a blessed decision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we are not asking this for ourselves or merely for the church, we are asking this for You and Your interest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are here to command You to fulfill this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, we also receive the burden to pray for the different church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since You are the One gathering us together, cause us to sense Your presence in all of our gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we petition You in one accord and touch Your throne of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We ask You to hear our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Pour out Your grace and blessing in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, we hide ourselves, Your work, Your recovery, Your church, and all the steps of the practice of Your new way in You and under the covering of Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We ask You to draw the boundary around us with Your precious blood and not allow the authorities of darkness to overstep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, cover us in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are touching Your throne of authority and opposing all counter prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If there are some who oppose us before You, they are not opposing us, they are opposing Your new way and Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, we ask You to act against all counter prayers, resisting the enemy and fighting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since we are here fighting the battle, we ask You to grant us the inner peace so that we may enjoy Your fighting and rest in Your fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May Your testimony, the testimony You have shown us, the testimony of the end time, be a living testimony, an anti-testimony, a testimony against Christianity, against its poison, against its traditions, against its oldness, and against its old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May Your testimony be a genuine living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, we also ask You to enable all the co-workers, elders, and full-timers to receive the burden to pray unceasingly and labor faithfully before You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, we will never enjoy rest before You have obtained Your rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We want to see You resting in all the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We want to establish all the saints homes and make them Your resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, perfect thousands of homes to be Your living testimony for the release and shining forth of Your truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Build us up and equip us with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Make us good soldiers to spread the gospel, the truth, and even the churches all over Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, hear our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, remember that we belong to You and have been set apart for You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Remember that we are here in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our prayers are also in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lord, we believe that for Your sake and for the sake of Your interest on the earth, You will answer our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We thank the Lord for giving us the time and the utterance to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must believe that He has heard our prayers in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to continue to pray that the Lord will execute what He has heard and fulfill our desires before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regarding the teaching of Truth Lessons, I hope all the elders will carry this out in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should try our best to put into practice every point we have fellowshipped in the previous two chapters regarding the teaching of Truth Lessons .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would emphasize again that every elder should take the lead to teach the truth by teaching a truth class in the meeting hall where he meets.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do know how to teach, we surely should teach, but even if we do not know how to teach, we still must teach, because elders should be apt to teach 1 Tim 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some of us may not know how to teach at the present time, but as long as there is the heart to learn, eventually we will be able to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we teach according to what I spoke in the previous chapters, we will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There will be forty days from the end of this term of the full-time training until the beginning of the next term.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This time is also the summer vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There will be many activities for college students.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that we could have a definite plan and arrangement for the gospel work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If possible, we should arrange for some of them to attend the summer training on The Conclusion of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This period of time can serve as a bridge to the full-time training to increase the number of those who have the heart to go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that we will pray for this matter and for the full-time training and its leading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are crucial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another matter we need to pray for is the move of propagation in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before we begin the propagation in the towns and villages in 1988, we will focus on laying a good foundation in the communities of the big cities.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to receive the burden to pray for the propagation.</S>
