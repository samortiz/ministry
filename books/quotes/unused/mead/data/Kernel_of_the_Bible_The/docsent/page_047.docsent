   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRITUAL ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 10:4 also says, They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the spiritual rock that flows out the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has been cleft for us, and out of Him flows the living water for our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to 1 Corinthians 11:3, Christ is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the Head of the Body and of every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is not only the Head; He is also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 11:3 indicates that Christ is the Head, and 1 Corinthians 12:12 indicates that He is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse says, For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>. This reveals that Christ is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, the Christ here is not the individual Christ; it is the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ Himself is the Head, and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, however, both the Head and the Body are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE FIRSTFRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1 Corinthians 15:20 we see that Christ is the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 47 and 45 of the same chapter we see that Christ is the second man and the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we put these three items together, we have the first, the second, and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that Christ is the first, the second, and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 22:13 reveals that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is not only the way; He is also the alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we all know, every word is composed of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the letters that compose every verse of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because He is the first letter, the Alpha, and the last letter, the Omega, He is certainly all the letters in between.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An English-language typewriter has twenty-six letters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With these letters we can compose any word, sentence, paragraph, or book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have such a typewriter in my study at home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By using the twenty-six letters on this typewriter, I can compose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the real typewriter containing all the letters from Alpha to Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever you want to say something, simply type Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day, we must practice typing with Christ as the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that everyone in the local churches will be a good typist, well able to type with Christ as the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE FIRST AND THE LAST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation 22:13 also tells us that Christ is the First and the Last.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the Alpha, He is first, and as the Omega, He is the Last.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE BEGINNING AND THE END</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, Revelation 22:13 reveals that Christ is the beginning and the end. As the beginning, nothing precedes Him, and as the end, nothing succeeds Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that before Christ and after Christ there is no other.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is the Christ you experience like this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must admit that the Christ experienced by many Christians is not.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We, however, must experience Christ in a full way, all the way from Alpha to Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before Alpha, there is no letter, and after Omega, there is also no letter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Alpha is the beginning, and the Omega is the end.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>ALL IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lastly, Christ is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This aspect of Christ is related to the new man, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to Colossians 3:11, in this new man, There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the new man Christ is in everyone, and Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is in you, and Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, in the new man, that is, in the church, there is no American, German, Chinese, or Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Likewise, there are no managers, servants, or Ph.D. s. Sometimes we refer to a certain brother as a brother with a doctor s degree.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not like to hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The doctor s degree must be put away, because in the new man there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the new man Christ is in everyone, and Christ is everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How we need to experience Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All these aspects of Christ are not doctrine, religion, or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Neither are they Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is for our enjoyment, and the issue of our enjoyment of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once again, this is a matter of Christ and the church, the kernel of the Bible.</S>
