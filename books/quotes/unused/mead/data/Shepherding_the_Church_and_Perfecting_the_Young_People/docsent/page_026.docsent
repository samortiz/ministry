   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEARING THE BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR TRAININGS AND CONFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The co-workers should not depend on me for the trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I cannot bear such a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ever since I returned on November 21, 1970, I have been in numerous meetings with no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, the burden of the Book Room is also upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I often stay up until midnight to review manuscripts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the brothers need to receive this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regardless of whether I am present, they must hold an East Asia conference at least once every two years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a conference will greatly benefit the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If my energy and time allow me to travel, I will return to help with the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In any case, it is necessary that the co-workers bear this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would be more suitable to have an East Asia conference during the holidays.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The summer holiday may be more suitable because a substantial number of saints either work in schools or are students.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most of my work in the United States is done in the summer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That time affords the best opportunity for me to work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to past years, the work accomplished during the summer is often more effective than what is done during the rest of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From June to September I will be in conferences, and the schedule for these three months will be very tight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the results reaped during these three months will be equivalent to the results for the rest of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason I will not be able to come to Taipei during the summer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the brothers and sisters need to receive the burden to pray for the international conference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A time of joint training is needed; it would be a great help to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Last week the saints from various places in Taiwan came together to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That training was a great help to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The strengthening from that training issued in positive results in the recent gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, a foundation must first be laid in every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Based on such a foundation, the trainings and conferences cause the saints to be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At present, the churches in Southeast Asia and Japan are somewhat established.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the co-workers can go and strengthen the churches there, an international conference would have a greater effect on the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, such a conference is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brothers should have more fellowship concerning this matter to confirm this need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The co-workers must always remember the direction of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On one hand, the co-workers should strengthen the local churches, help them to spread, and perfect and cultivate the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, the co-workers should encourage the churches to attend the international conference and help the churches to prepare for the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The co-workers and the elders must understand our current situation so that they endeavor in this direction for the sake of the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord will bless and propagate His work, so the churches need to receive this burden and give one-tenth of their offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders may decide to send the offering to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The general business office of the church in Taipei can open an account to take care of the offerings from the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever a need arises in relation to the international conference, these funds will be available for use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the churches are led to use their offering in a certain way, they should do so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, the church in Kaohsiung may feel to help the church in Taitung and give its offering to Taitung.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Or the church in Taitung may feel to give its offering to Hualien.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if a local church is not led to give to a specific need, in principle it should not keep its offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church should send it to a fund in the general business office in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, this fund is not for the general business office; the business office merely oversees the use of this fund on behalf of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When there is a shortage in funds for the international conference, the general business office can designate a portion of these funds for use.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we should not depend entirely on this fund to meet the needs for the international conference.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There may be a need for the churches to give more.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In short, every church should give one-tenth of their offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>PAST PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The work in Hong Kong began in 1937 when Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi was led by the Lord and confirmed by the work to begin the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the spring of 1950 Brother Nee visited Hong Kong from mainland China for the last time and brought a revival to the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During this revival the brothers and sisters willingly handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At that time Brother Nee sent me a cable, asking me to go to Hong Kong and make arrangements for the elders, deacons, and all the services in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I stayed in Hong Kong for one and a half months and made arrangements for the services of the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the church did not yet have a meeting hall, we formed a purchasing and construction group.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We then bought a piece of land on Observatory Road and began the construction of a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From 1950 to 1956 the saints progressed according to the leading in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many blessings were brought in during that period of time, because of the one accord among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From 1956 to 1958 one of the elders there was dissenting concerning the leading in the work; he desired to take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the problem in Taiwan broke out, this brother spoke with the dissenting brothers in Taiwan and supported them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1961 he began to publicly accuse me of speaking heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He could not accept the teaching concerning the Son being the Father, concerning the Son being the Spirit, or concerning the New Jerusalem not being a place but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was also strongly opposed to our practice of burying our oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In 1968 his opposition became stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He considered burying our oldness to be heretical and said that it was an act of nailing the Lord Jesus to the cross again, which violated the Lord s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In August of 1970, while the co-workers were absent, he called a meeting of the whole church, in which he openly declared his opposition and claimed that I spoke heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Another elder in Hong Kong felt the severity of the situation and called Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and other elders, who were in the United States at the time, to discuss how to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In September three brothers returned to Hong Kong, and the dissenting brother was stopped from doing anything further for the time being.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When he continued his opposition, Brother Weigh called me long distance and said that I should go to Hong Kong as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After much fellowship with the brothers in the United States, I went to Hong Kong on October 15.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The six elders had announced a conference beginning on October 16.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the dissenting elder called a meeting on October 15, in which he stirred up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On October 16 the saints took over the meeting hall and declared that they were chasing away heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As a result, we decided not to have the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord used this situation to sanctify the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This opposition appeared to be related to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, it was not about the truth but about a brother wanting to do another work and have another move.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His actions were the same as the opposing brothers in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All the brothers and sisters are clear that it was not a matter of the truth but of someone desiring to establish a territory and do his own work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The most fearful thing in the work is for someone to have ambition and establish another territory.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There was nothing controversial in the aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This ministry does not speak heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It does not say that the Lord Jesus is a sinner or that the Lord Jesus is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Accusing me of speaking heresy was an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The dissenting ones were not willing to receive the leading in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They put out their own teachings and established a territory for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This was the basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Nevertheless, the Lord used the turmoil that they stirred up to sanctify His church.</S>
