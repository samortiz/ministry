<h2 class="head2">Having a Good Testimony in Their Living</h2>
<p>The elders are those who care for the church (1 Tim. 3:5). An elder must have a good testimony in his living (vv. 2-3, 7) and be watchful. It is not good if he is careless or if he makes mistakes. These affect his testimony. Since he cares for and takes the lead in the local church, he is one on whom every eye gazes and at whom every finger points. This means that as soon as he makes a mistake, people will see it and know it. If you are an ordinary brother, people will not pay much attention to you; however, if you become a leading one or a serving one in the church, people will begin to notice you. Thus, the elders must be watchful in regard to their living and have a good testimony before men.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Lead Well</h2>
<p>An elder, as a head sheep, leads the saints by walking in front. Hence, 1 Timothy 5:17 says that a proper elder should &ldquo;take the lead well.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Apt to Teach</h2>
<p>An elder should be apt to teach (3:2b). According to the testimony of the churches in various localities, I am afraid that we are inadequate in this matter. With such an inadequacy, the churches will not only become paralyzed but will fail to bear rich fruit. The growth of a local church and its rich fruit depends entirely on the elders&rsquo; ability to teach. An elder is like someone who teaches in a family. If a mother merely sends her children to school and does not have the ability to teach them at home, her children will be lacking in their education. The education of a child does not depend merely on the instruction received from the teachers at school; even more, it depends upon the guidance received at home, especially from the mother. If a mother knows how to teach her children, one can be sure that their education will be carried out in a good way. Therefore, elders should be apt to teach.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, the elders need to read more, especially the Bible and the Life-studies. There is a great need to read the Life-studies. Within the Life-studies there are over twelve hundred messages, each message containing an average of ten pages. Therefore, the twelve hundred messages have a total of approximately twelve thousand pages. The elders need to enter into the Life-studies. If they take the lead to read, the brothers and sisters will follow. It is not appropriate for the elders to ask the brothers and sisters to read if they themselves do not read. If this is the case, the elders will not be able to answer the saints properly when they have questions in regard to their reading. However, if the elders read the Life-studies, they will be able to find a way to teach and instruct the saints. This is similar to mothers who tutor their children at home. In order for a mother to tutor her children in mathematics, she must know mathematics herself. Moreover, the Life-studies can truly supply the brothers and sisters, give them light, and provide them with the life supply.</p>
<p>I am concerned that though there are many spiritual publications among us, not many brothers and sisters dive into them. It seems that in their living, there is only one book&mdash;the Bible&mdash;which they may read when they have time and set aside when they run out of time. When they have enough time, they also attend the meetings of the church. If this is the case, the church cannot be strong, and it will not bear rich fruit. We all know that fruit is produced out of the riches of life. If a life has no richness, it cannot bear rich fruit. Hence, the elders need to take the lead to learn the truth. They need to read the Bible more, especially the New Testament.</p>
<p>There is one more matter that needs our attention; that is, when we begin to read the Life-studies, we should not expect to read eight or ten messages per day. This will cause spiritual indigestion. It is best to read half a message per day. At this pace it will take only six to seven years to finish the twelve hundred messages. Although this way may seem slow, we must remember that it is better to be afraid of standing still than of being slow. If all the elders spend the next six years to read the Life-studies, I believe that they will begin to reap the benefit within half a year, and their gain over the long term will be tremendous. May we redeem the time and enter into all these riches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if all the churches read the Life-studies, the churches will become &ldquo;scholarly spiritual families.&rdquo; The newly saved ones among us will then be influenced and edified by this practice and enter into the Life-studies with us. In this way the church will surely become strong. The rulers of nations know that for a nation to be strong, there must be a strong system of education. The reason that Taiwan is so strong and promising is due to its fundamental education. If the government in Taiwan had not promoted a strong system of education for the past forty years, Taiwan would be incapable and incompetent in everything. The reason that Taiwan can accomplish so much and reach such a high standard is due to its high level of education. On the contrary, if Taiwan did not have such a high standard of education, it would never be able to accomplish anything.</p>
<p>If the church wants to be strong, it should not expect to have a Pentecostal-style revival. Such revivals can be likened to rain showers. There may be a rain shower in the morning, but the roads dry up by the afternoon. There have been revivals in the church in the past, but they came quickly and left quickly. We do not want this kind of revival. It is like a rain shower that has no lasting benefit. Neither should we rely on chance, thinking that since we have now taken the new way and have changed the system, all things will be revived. If we do not see results for several years, we may assume that the new way does not work and does not bear results. In fact, it is not that the new way does not yield results but that everything has its timing. We know that a farmer does not sow today and reap tomorrow. It is not that fast. To grow a fruit tree, a farmer needs to spend a few years cultivating it in a proper way; then in due time it will bear fruit. However, if the tree is not cultivated properly, it will never bear fruit.</p>
<p>We should not think that once we change the system, we will have an immediate success. The purpose of changing the system is simply to find a way. For instance, Chinese males used to have long plaited hair and wear Chinese-style clothing. Now, because of the influence of the West, they feel that it is not so convenient to wear that kind of hairstyle and have that style of clothing; thus, they keep their hair short and wear Western-style clothing. This has become part of their daily living. In the same way, our hope in regard to changing the system is not that our numbers will immediately be doubled, from ten thousand to twenty thousand and then from twenty thousand to forty thousand; rather, our hope is to bring in a way that we can all enter into and that will eventually become our living.</p>
<p>In this kind of living, the first and foremost emphasis is that the elders need to take the lead to learn and speak the truth in the churches. In other words, every elder needs to learn to speak in the church according to the truth. This is different from speaking in a home. To speak in a meeting, we must speak loudly and with the proper cadence so that people can understand us; this is related to teaching. Of course, in prophesying, it is not merely a matter of the voice. We also need to have the mind of a prophet; that is, we need to receive more light, revelation, and supply from the Life-studies. In addition, we need to learn to develop the proper utterance so that we may freely apply what is spoken of in the Life-studies and be able to minister words of supply. This will change our atmosphere. In this way the church will surely become strong and rich.</p>
<p>We always hope that there will be a church in every town and village; however, we do not have enough full-time serving ones to work in every place. Hence, there is a need for the brothers in the different localities, that is, the elders in the local churches, to do this themselves. For this reason, they bear a great and extremely important responsibility to learn the truth and to be apt to teach.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
