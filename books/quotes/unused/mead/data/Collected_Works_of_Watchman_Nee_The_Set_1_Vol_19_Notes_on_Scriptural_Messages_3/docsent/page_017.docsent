   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEARS Issue No. 48 Scripture Reading: Heb 5:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we are going to study a certain subject or, we may also say, a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every man has these things, but he does not have them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is something often done but not done at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What are these things?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are tears.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I wonder if you know the importance of tears.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a person is able to shed tears, it is a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Someone who had very deep spiritual experiences once said, "If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you might as well ask a pickpocket to keep your purse for you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a true statement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you will be as disappointed as if you asked a pickpocket to keep your purse for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tears are something that the world cannot do without.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Anyone who cannot shed tears has lost his characteristic as a man and cannot be counted as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not like to see men who are so proud that they consider shedding tears to be something that men should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some even consider that it is a sign of courage not to shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some think that by not shedding tears, they appear to be better and more outstanding than others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am afraid that this is not at all true!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would say rather that a dry eye indicates that there is a dry and hardened heart within such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It tells us that the heart is defiant, has no feeling, and is numb like wood and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times shedding tears reveals a person's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing reveals what is in the heart as much as tears do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, tears are the outlet of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How do we know this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose I am extremely sad today; I cannot sigh, talk, eat, sleep, or work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What should I do in order to alleviate my sorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you go to ask a physician if he has a cure for someone who is so sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he understands psychology, he would say that such a one should have his best friend over for a heart-to-heart talk or for a few good jokes so that he can let out his frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps he should visit a scenic place, take a walk in a grassy meadow, or listen to music that will cheer him up and cause him to forget whatever has made him sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But none of these things will work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the doctor is experienced in human life, he would say, "Let him cry his heart out and everything will be solved."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever you are heavily pressed within and unable to be relieved, a few tears will vent your frustration and the whole thing will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is quite amazing that something within your heart must come out through your eyes, as though the eyes are the outlet of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the tears are shed, the heart is opened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I remember that there was once a person with a physical handicap.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was quite angry about the defect in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nothing seemed to please him, and he wanted to end his life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For seven years anger burned constantly within him like a flame.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day he went to a great concert.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The whole audience thought the concert was marvelous, and their souls were all carried away into a rapturous and soothing ecstasy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But what did this one do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He shed a few tears.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Someone asked him, "Was not today's music beautiful?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why did you shed tears?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He replied, "Before the concert I was bored and very, very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But after listening to the music and shedding some tears, everything is all right."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The music punctured a hole in his heart so that the tears were able to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Originally, depression locked up his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the tears flowed out, his depression was washed away with the tears.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The human side of his nature was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the beginning, his nature was bound and locked up by his depression; but now it was released by tears.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The shedding of tears shows a man that he still has his human nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through tears, a man is made human.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some people consider tears to be a sign of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the contrary, the inability to shed tears means that a man lacks humanity or has buried his humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Tears are the common portion of men on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason, our Lord also shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though the Bible records His joy, it never records His laughter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the contrary, it records His tears.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Hebrews 5:7 we see that the Lord's tears are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This shows us that He often shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Isaiah 53 also says that He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Tears are very precious because only tears can wash man's eyes and make them clean.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is so much dust, dirt, and filth on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These things are ready at any moment to invade your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Fortunately, there are always tears to wash your eyes and give you clear eyesight.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the eyes did not have tears, I am afraid that no one could see anything through his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Tears have a cleansing function, not only in the physical realm, but also in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A few more tears allow a person to see a little more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without tears our spiritual eyes will lose their function.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once Mr. Panton spoke to a young couple, "Although you are so good, you lack one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you could do this thing, you would be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You should pray for the Lord's soon return."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That evening the husband told his wife, "This time we must listen to the word of this old gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Tonight we must pray for this matter thoroughly."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The husband prayed faithfully and hoped that his wife would pray after him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But she would not because she confidently said within herself, "I have a wonderful family.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our marriage relationship is harmonious and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our living is quite pleasant, and our house is quite comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everything is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why should I ask the Lord to come back soon?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let us not be in a rush."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This continued for seven months until suddenly her husband died.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Later on when she saw Mr. Panton, she held his hand and told him tearfully, "After seven months, I have been asking the Lord to come back soon every day." Tears had washed her eyes so that she was able to see clearly.</S>
