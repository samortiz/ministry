<p>We also have encountered problems. We have gained spiritual help from Madame Guyon, but if she were among us today, she might influence us to worship an idol of Mary, and we might be unable to resist. We also have been helped by Andrew Murray and even recommend his books to the saints, but if he were alive today, he might bring in a speaking that opposed the ground.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we highly esteem the spiritual supply of Brother T. Austin-Sparks. However, when we invited him to visit us, he should not have touched the matter of the ground. During his first visit in 1955, the fellowship was very good, and since he did not touch the ground, we invited him to come a second time. During his second visit in 1957, sadly, he touched the issue of the ground. At that time we had serious fellowship. He said that any gathering of two or three into the Lord&rsquo;s name is the church. Afterward, I visited him in London, and I was his guest of honor. We had countless talks together. In the end, however, he insisted that as long as a gathering is in Christ, it is on the ground of the church and that as long as two or three are gathered, the Lord is in their midst and that is the church.</p>
<p>We are not criticizing or opposing Brother Austin-Sparks, but he did not see the danger of this matter. If we accepted this kind of teaching, the church in Taipei could be divided into not only three or five groups but into dozens of groups. If we can say that any gathering of two or three is the church, then Taipei could have many churches. We fellowshipped this with Brother Austin-Sparks and said that if we practiced his fellowship, there would be the danger of endless divisions. However, Brother Austin-Sparks would not accept this word.</p>
<p>We need two views concerning our fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks. His spirituality is unquestionable; we esteem it highly, just as we esteem Madame Guyon&rsquo;s spirituality. But we cannot accept Madame Guyon&rsquo;s idol worship in Catholicism. Likewise, we fully accept <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> by Andrew Murray, but we cannot accept the denomination that he was in. This requires discernment. We highly esteem and fully accept the spiritual fellowship from Brother Austin-Sparks, but his view regarding the ground is not scriptural, and we cannot accept it. The saints who were affected by him have caused serious problems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>We were aware of the problems that could arise the first time we invited Brother Austin-Sparks. We were also aware of this when he spoke of the ground during his second visit. I did not initiate the fellowship concerning the ground. Sadly, some brothers among us did not keep their bounds. Regardless of their intention, a chaotic situation came in because they did not keep their bounds. The chaos that ensued did not allow us to invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come again. When our situation is stable, we can invite him for his spiritual portion. However, he should give us absolute freedom concerning our practice of the church.</p>
<p>I was not ignorant of our brother&rsquo;s view concerning our practice. I have known his view since I was in Shanghai. I invited him to visit us because our situation was stable and because of the one accord. However, I relied too much on our situation. When I objected to our brother&rsquo;s view concerning the ground, a few co-workers went beyond their measure. If the co-workers acknowledge that I am taking the lead here, then please allow me to say that since I was the one who invited Brother Sparks, I was responsible for the fellowship. When I objected to the fellowship, the co-workers should have stood with me. When I invited him, the co-workers accepted my invitation; when I objected to the fellowship, they should have stood with me and kept their bounds. If they are willing to stay within their measure, we can invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come again when our situation is stable.</p>
<p>Before that time we had the one accord and were in harmony. But problems arose after those years. The underlying cause of the problems is related to our brother&rsquo;s visit. I am responsible for inviting our brother, and I am responsible for raising objections to the fellowship. The co-workers are under my leading and should have stayed within their measure. They need to comprehend this word. The work has been under my leading for many years, but our brother&rsquo;s visit damaged the work because when there was a disagreement and I objected, the co-workers held differing opinions. Perhaps no evil was intended, but it caused us problems. It is as if the boat was capsized.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING A SERIOUS LESSON</h2>
<p>This fellowship is for us to learn a serious lesson. When Brother Nee was among us, we did things as he said they should be done, and whatever he spoke, we spoke; we did not have a second opinion. When he was taking the lead, it was his speaking that mattered; we just obeyed. Even if I did not see things as he did, I followed without questioning, and this brought the blessing. I invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come, and the co-workers accepted that invitation. I raised objections, but they held opinions that were contrary to mine. This was our problem. As a result, rumors arose, and the saints became confused; some even spoke of compromising and waiting to see if we would change our stand. There is no need to wait and see, and we do not compromise the truth. We only know to follow the truth.</p>
<p>If the co-workers want me to take the lead, then I will take the lead. Regardless of whether I was right or wrong in raising objections to our brother, I was responsible for our fellowship. The co-workers must learn to stay within their measure; otherwise, I cannot take the lead. The co-workers have solemnly indicated that they accept my leading and are willing to move forward. I hope that we have all learned this serious lesson.</p>
<p>This fellowship is necessary for the co-workers to be in harmony. My concern is that some may still disapprove. Therefore, I am begging the co-workers to stay within their bounds. If our situation were stable, we would have invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come a third time. However, we did not receive the help that we should have received from his last visit; instead, we brought unnecessary trouble upon ourselves. After the second visit, those who said that they were helped by Brother Austin-Sparks became factors of division. Receiving help is good, but it is wrong for someone to become a cause of division after receiving help. My heart grieves because of this. We love the Lord, and we belong to Him. Therefore, please consider these words.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
