   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Way to Experience God in the Gospel of John THE WORD, THE FLESH, AND THE BREATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospel of John, there are three wonderful words.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first chapter, the first verse, we read, "In the beginning was the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So we have the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in the same chapter there is another word, flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us" v. 14 . Then at the end of the book, in chapter twenty, we have breath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus, the resurrected One, breathed on the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . "Spirit" in Greek means "breath." So, here it can be rendered "breath." He breathed upon the disciples and told them to receive the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So we have three words: the Word, the flesh, and the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word was God, the flesh is man, and the breath is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of John is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning, in eternity, there was God who was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But on the earth, in time, He became a man who was flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then from chapter one to chapter twenty we see a man as the flesh who was the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With Him there is incarnation, crucifixion including redemption , resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then eventually, He came back to the disciples to do simply one thing: to breathe on them and ask them to receive Him as the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the end of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the beginning was the Word, and at the end is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And in this breath everything is included.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just consider again the whole Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He accomplished redemption by crucifixion, and He was buried and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Did He become a great Lord to sit on the throne for man to bow down to worship Him?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is this in the Gospel of John?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus in the Gospel of John is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was made flesh, and eventually the flesh was resurrected to be the breath for us to breathe in. CHRIST AS THE BREATH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Read the Gospel of John again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the beginning was the Word, the Word was made flesh, and the flesh was resurrected to become a breath.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He came back to the disciples, not as a great giant asking everyone to bow down to worship Him, but in a very silent way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of a sudden He was there, and nobody knew how He came in 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was just there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And He did not tell them to do this or to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did something rather unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He breathed on them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He simply breathed on them and told them to receive the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not tell the disciples, "I am the Son of God, and I have been resurrected; so you must do this to glorify Me, and you must do that to magnify Me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not tell them to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He just breathed on them and told them to receive the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That was good enough, because everything is included in that breath.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that time He was never absent from them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He came, but He never left, because now He, as the holy breath, was within all the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am afraid most Christians know the beginning of John, but they are not clear about the ending of John.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The beginning of this book is something very high, very profound, and very great.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everything that was made was made through Him, and in Him was life, and this life was the light of men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But at the end the disciples went fishing 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And while they were fishing, this wonderful One also was there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just compare the two ends of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The beginning is very high, but the ending seems very low.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the secret, the mystery of Christ, is with these seemingly foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To them He was just like the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That is all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After all that He accomplished in this Gospel, He was just the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the third stage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the first stage He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the second stage He was man as the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in the third stage He is simply the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is why it is rather hard for people to realize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all know Christ in the first and second stages, but we do not know Him properly and accurately in the third stage.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may say, "Well, I have heard that there is the Holy Spirit, and that Christ is in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have heard this, but we must know more adequately that Christ is not only in the Spirit, but Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"And the Lord is the Spirit" 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is the Spirit, the breath, the air.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
