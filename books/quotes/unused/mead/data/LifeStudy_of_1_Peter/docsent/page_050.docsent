   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REJECTED STONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING THE HEAD OF THE CORNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 7 Peter goes on to say, To you therefore who believe is the preciousness; but to the unbelieving, A stone which the builders rejected, this became the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Greek, the word rendered preciousness here is a kindred word to honor in verses 4 and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone held in honor, is the preciousness to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But to the unbelieving, He is a rejected, despised stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ s preciousness is not only a matter of condition, but also a matter of His position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For Him to be precious means that He is held in honor, that He occupies an honorable position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse we are told that the builders rejected Christ as the living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These builders were the Jewish leaders in Judaism, who were supposed to build the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They rejected Christ to the uttermost, as the Lord had predicted Matt 21:38-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, Christ became the head of the corner in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen, in his early preaching Peter declared this fact to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To the unbelieving, Christ is a stone rejected by the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, this rejected stone has become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Christ is a stone of two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With Him as the stone for God s building, there is the aspect of honor and also the aspect of rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, Christ was rejected; on the other hand, He has been honored.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was rejected by the Jewish builders, but He has been honored by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How do we know that Christ was rejected by the Jewish leaders?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know it by the fact that they put Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was their rejection of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How do we know that Christ has been honored by God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know this by the fact that God resurrected Him and exalted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the resurrection and exaltation of Christ are strong signs both that God has chosen Him and that He is held in honor by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 8 Peter continues, And, A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is not only a rejected stone and a stone held in honor; He is also a stumbling stone and a rock of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reliable Christ, being rejected, became a stumbling stone, at which the rejecting Judaizers stumbled Matt 21:44a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the stone, Christ functions in both a positive way and a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For us, He is the cornerstone positively, but for the unbelieving Jews, He is a stumbling stone and a rock of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THOSE WHO STUMBLE AT THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 8 Peter speaks of those who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the antecedent of the relative pronoun who ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, there is not a clear antecedent expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, we may say that the antecedent is implied.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter s thought may be that who stumble at the word may refer to anyone or to everyone who stumbles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we stumble at the word, then this who includes us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It refers to anyone throughout the generations who stumbles at the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we need to ask what is the word at which people may stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It certainly is not the word with the guileless milk mentioned in 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, it is the word quoted by Peter in verses 6 through 8, the word regarding a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, being laid in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It also refers to the word concerning the stone rejected by the builders that becomes the head of the corner v. 7 . Furthermore, it includes the word in verse 8 about this stone being a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the word at which people may stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of the atmosphere in the Lord s recovery today, it is easy for us to believe in such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Jews at the time of the Lord Jesus and the apostles would not believe in it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their attitude was that it was impossible for Jesus of Nazareth ever to be the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of believing in this word, the Jewish leaders and the rabbis argued against it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whoever does not believe this word will stumble at it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not think that it is impossible for Christians to stumble at the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many are the Christians who have stumbled at the word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not believe that the Lord Jesus can be so strict or straight.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes we have spoken with certain believers regarding the matter of Christ being both the building stone and the stumbling stone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They have replied, No, the Lord Jesus is merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He would never be a stone of stumbling or a rock of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord has a broad heart; He is not narrow like you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You think that you are the only ones who are right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are narrow, but the Lord Jesus is not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if we are too broad, we shall not believe this word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We shall not believe that, on the one hand, Christ is the building stone and that, on the other hand, He is also the stumbling stone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many Christians have stumbled at this strict word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Jewish leaders have not been the only ones who have stumbled at it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have you ever thought that Christ could purposely be a rock of offense?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to be careful concerning this and ask ourselves if we believe this word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not believe it, then we stumble at this word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then automatically the Lord will become a stumbling block to us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We stumble at such a word because, in our opinion, it is too narrow and strict.</S>
