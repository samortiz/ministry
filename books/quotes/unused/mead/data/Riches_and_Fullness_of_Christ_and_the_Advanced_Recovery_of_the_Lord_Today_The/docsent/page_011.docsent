   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST BECOMING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The riches of Christ are the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When these riches are hidden in Christ, they remain the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they are expressed without in Christ, they become the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, Peter, John, James, Mary, and many others came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of Him they all received.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let me ask you: what was it that they received?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Was it the grace hidden in the Lord Jesus, or the grace expressed out from the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was grace expressed out from the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why John said that of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This grace is expressed, and we have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It keeps coming again and again without stopping.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, it becomes an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Riches of Christ, Who Is the Embodiment of the Processed Triune God, Experienced by the Believers, Overflowing to Become His Fullness</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the riches of Christ are in Him, they are the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they are expressed, they become Christ's fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the riches that are in this Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, are experienced by us, they overflow to become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1962, at Easter, I spoke this message for the first time in the Bay Area in America.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I remember that I used the riches of America as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I said that when I first arrived in America, I did not understand how the Americans could be so tall and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later when I went to the supermarkets and saw all the rich foods, I began to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Americans grow to their size because of the rich American food they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In an American supermarket, there are all kinds of rich food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the Americans eat these foods and have digested them, every one of them becomes a big American.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The different kinds of food are the riches of America, and the individual big Americans are the fullness of America.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The American food in the supermarket becomes the constitution of the Americans within a week after they eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before being eaten, the American beef, chicken, fish, vegetables, and fruits are the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After they are eaten and digested, they become the fullness of America.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Americans themselves are the fullness of America.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They express the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same way, the riches of Christ were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After we have eaten these riches, they are digested in us, and we become the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians are simply the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This fullness is there to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, we are all Christians here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although some are taller, whereas others are smaller, in their spiritual stature, we have all been produced through eating and enjoying the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When all the Christians are put together, the fullness that is expressed is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This fullness is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Riches of Christ Overflowing to the Believers to Become the Fullness of Christ as His Expression and God's Fullness Ephesians 1:23</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the riches of Christ overflow in and over the believers, they become the fullness of Christ as His expression and God's fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, the riches of Christ become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since He is the embodiment of God, this fullness also becomes the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John 1:16, the fullness of God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By Ephesians 1:23, God's fullness in Christ becomes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This fullness of Christ in the end becomes the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we can see that the fullness of God is first expressed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Next it is expressed in the believers, who are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end, when it is expressed in the church, it is still the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This Fullness That Is the Expression of Christ Being the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fullness that is the expression of the riches of Christ is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Body is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If while I am standing here, I have only a head hanging in the air without a body under it, I will not at all be full.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if here is a big American who measures seven feet, one inch, and who weighs three hundred fifty pounds, his body will express his fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same way, the Body of Christ is the expression of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This Body Being the Church Constituted of the Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, this Body is in Christ and is constituted by the divine life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A false Christian may have the name of a Christian, but he does not have the life of Christ, and he has no part in the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Judas, the betrayer of the Lord, had the name of a Christian, but he did not have anything to do with the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, he had no part in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every one who has a part in the organic Body of Christ has the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Second, this Body comes out of Christ and is one in life and nature with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the members of the Body of Christ come out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In their spiritual life and nature, they are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Third, this Body is an organism begotten by God, rather than an organization made by man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This organism is the organic Body of Christ, and it is constituted of the riches of Christ enjoyed and digested by us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 24, 1989</S>
