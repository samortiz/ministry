As the Means for Us to Take Christ as Our Righteousness by Faith</h2><p>Galatians 5:5 says, “We by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness.” By the Spirit here is in contrast to by the flesh (3:3), and out of faith is in contrast to out of the works of law (3:2). Our hope of righteousness is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 1:30). It is not out of the works of law in the flesh but out of faith in the Spirit. We do not have our own merit before God. Our only merit is Christ. It is by the Spirit and by faith that we await Christ as the hope of righteousness. Now in the divine fellowship, through the Spirit and by faith we have Christ as the righteousness that we live out daily.<h2 class=head2>41. Witnessing with Our Spirit That We Are the Children of God</h2><p>Romans 8:16 says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.” This is the witnessing of the Spirit when we cry “Abba, Father” (v. 15). Such a witnessing testifies to us and assures us that we are the children of God, who possess His life; it also limits us and restricts us to a living and walk that are according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God. Moreover, it is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also; rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit. This also reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit. Hence, the indwelling Spirit’s witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is a matter of the divine fellowship. When we enjoy the supply of the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God, we have the sweet and intimate inward sense that we are God’s children.
