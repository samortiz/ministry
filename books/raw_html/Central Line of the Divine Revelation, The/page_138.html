<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Coming through Incarnation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. With God as Reality and Grace<br>for His Dispensing into His Believers</H2><P>Christ came through incarnation with God as reality and grace for His dispensing into His believers. John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us..., full of grace and reality," and verse 17 says, "For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ." The law could not come, because it had no life; hence, it was given. But because He is a living person, Jesus was not given; He came down to man, and He came with something. Christ came through incarnation with God as reality and as grace.</P><P>Reality is God gained by us, and grace is God enjoyed by us. We gain God and we enjoy God. God as grace is God enjoyed by us, and God as reality is God gained by us. By gaining God and enjoying Him, we eventually enjoy all His fullness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Of His Fullness His Believers<br>Having All Received, and Grace upon Grace</H2><P>Of His fullness His believers have all received, and grace upon grace (John 1:16). Today, the grace upon grace that we are enjoying is a matter of dispensing. We are enjoying and He is dispensing. He is dispensing for our enjoyment. Our enjoyment today is altogether a matter of the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</P><P>This dispensing of the Triune God into us can take place only by the Holy Spirit in our spirit. This is the reason that we must remain in our spirit. When we get out of our spirit, we must return quickly and remain there. In our spirit we enjoy the dispensing, and from the dispensing we receive the fullness, all the riches of what the Triune God is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</H2><P>In incarnation the divine dispensing was mainly for Christ, the Head, but in resurrection the divine dispensing is mainly for us, the Body. The Head and the Body are two marvelous entities in the universe. The dispensing in incarnation for the Head has been completed, but the dispensing in resurrection for the Body is still going on today.</P>
