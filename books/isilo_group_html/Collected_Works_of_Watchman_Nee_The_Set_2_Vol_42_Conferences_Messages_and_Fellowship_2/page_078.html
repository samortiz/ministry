Last year in Shanghai a Western missionary working for a mission came to me and told me of a person sent by the mission board to work at a school. The man had been in Shanghai for six years already, and no teacher or student in the school could get along with him. He had a terrible temper. No one in the school could do anything about him; neither could the mission board do anything about him. It intended to send him back to America by the first of November. When the Western missionary came to me for help, he said, "This man is very peculiar. He never laughs. Every time he sees others, he gives them a terrible face. He has a hot temper throughout the day, and everyone is afraid of him. When he shows up, others run away. He has been this way for six years. No one can get along with him in the school, and all four hundred students in the school are afraid of him. No matter where he goes, he gets into arguments with others. I am afraid that he is possessed by some kind of demon. Mr. Nee, you are familiar with the teaching on overcoming. What can you do to help him?" When I heard this, I rejoiced in my heart. Here was another hopeless case. Once man becomes hopeless, God has His way. God heals terminal patients. I promised the missionary that I would go and visit the man. After two days, I was in another person's home. That particular man also came. After introductions, everyone left. When I looked at the man, I almost fainted. I had never seen another man like him in my entire life. His eyes, nose, mouth, and every feature on his face seemed to be designed specifically to express anger. I could not have agreed more with the one who spoke with me two days ago. When I saw the man, I froze. Perhaps he was indeed possessed by demons! But when he saw me, he began to cry. Tears rolled down his cheeks, and he said to me, "They do not want me anymore." It was hard to tell if he was sad or angry. But his face became even uglier.</p><p>I asked him, "How do you feel about yourself?" He said, "I have often bought gifts for others. I preach the gospel to others, and I pray for others. When others are sick, I pray for them, and they become well. But I admit that I have somewhat of a bad temper." I said, "Only somewhat bad?" He said, "Frankly speaking, it is terribly bad! I have a temper like a beast." I then asked him, "Were you like this from the time you were a child, or did you become this way later?" He said, "If I remember right, I have had a bad temper since I was four years old. When I was thirteen years old, my mother died, and my temper grew worse. Today I cannot do anything about my temper. Not only am I not glorifying the Lord, I am actually sinning all the time. I feel that I am the most pitiful man in the whole world. No one will nod at me or speak to me." While he was speaking, he was crying. I began to laugh. He said, "Do not laugh at my bad temper," and I said, "I am not laughing at your bad temper. I am laughing for joy. I am happy that you cannot make it. When you cannot make it, God will have a way."</p><p>I then said, "A person like you should not have any problem at all. It is not hard for you to overcome. You can overcome in an instant. The question is not whether you are good or able. The question is whether or not God is able. Victory has nothing to do with yourself. Victory depends on Christ. It is Christ in you who overcomes for you. Victory does not come by trusting in yourself. Victory fully depends on Christ and on Him overcoming for you within you. Victory can only be found in Christ, not in you." He said, "What should I do to stop my temper?" I said, "You do not have to do anything. Just let Christ do everything. Let Him live for you within you. Your eyes should not be set on yourself, but only on God's Christ. He alone can give you the victory." We talked for four hours, but the light still could not penetrate his mind. Later we prayed together, and he prayed, "God, I am too evil. I have lost hope in myself; I can do nothing about myself. From now on, I do not trust in myself. I cannot overcome. God, if You do not overcome for me, I will never make it by myself. From now on, I will not be responsible for myself. You must take responsibility for me!"</p><p>After he prayed in such an honest way, he asked, "What should I do after I go home?" I said, "You should do nothing." He began to smile. He took a few steps and then turned back and said, "Is there really nothing that I need to do?" I said, "Indeed, you do not need to move at all. If Satan comes to tempt you to exercise your patience, you should say, `I cannot be patient. I will let Christ be my patience!'" He said, "That is right. That is right." He began to speak to himself, "I do not need to do anything. If I am ever saved from my temper, it is God's work and not my work." After a few days, I asked others about his condition. One man answered, "It is amazing. Truly amazing! The whole school has never been so quiet as it has been in the last few days. We have never seen him so quiet during the past six years as he has been in the past few days. There has been no noise at all. God has demonstrated His miracle and power in this man." Brothers and sisters, if that man could overcome, anyone can overcome. After a few days, he came to our meeting and began to smile. Later his colleagues and students testified that he had changed. Even the mission board that intended to send him home decided not to send him back because of his change.</p><p>Do not think that praying and reading the Word alone will give us the power to overcome. I am not saying that we should not pray or read the Word. There is a place for prayer and a place for reading the Word. But prayer and the reading of the Word alone cannot enable a person to overcome sin. Matthew 5 through 7 says that we are the sons of God. It does not say that we have to be sons of God. If it were up to us to be sons of God, we could never make it. Matthew 5:16 says, "So that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens." If a man has good works, the glory goes to the Father. This proves that the good works are done by God through man. This is why the glory goes to God and not to man. If Brother Chi delivers a good message, no one should praise Watchman Nee. If we have good works, why should others give glory to God? The only reason they give glory to God is that these good works are from God; they are done by God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 78</div><br></body></html>
