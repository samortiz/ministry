   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPRESSING THE SUBJECTIVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is our life and life supply for the purpose that we might express God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God cannot be expressed through man in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If He would remain in heaven and not get into us and be wrought into our being, He could not be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God had to find a way to enter into us and to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then our being will express not ourselves, but God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the objective God, the God far away from us, has become the subjective God in our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is not only within us, but is being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the Apostle Paul could say, For to me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul did not say, For me to live is Saul of Tarsus, a learned Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, For to me to live is Christ, because the very God in Christ had been received by Paul and wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul did not express himself, but Christ who had been wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is God s purpose, and it is the reason He created us with a spirit and a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Bible, our soul is our being, our character, our person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As persons, we are not intended by God to express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, God intends that we express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our daily life and in our behavior we should not express ourselves, but God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to express God, we firstly need to exercise our spirit and take Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we need to live the kind of life in our being, person, and character that expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then people will say, This person does not express the American way of life; he expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For us to receive God, we need a spirit; and for us to live Him out and express Him, we need a personality, which is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may think that those who are strong can express God, but that those who are not so strong cannot express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Others think that the intelligent ones can express God, but that the dull ones cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the dull often can express God better than the wise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have known a number of intelligent believers who did not express God; instead, they expressed their cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I have also known some country people with very little education who truly expressed God because they lived by God and expressed Him through their personality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that we have a spirit to receive God and a soul to live out God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps you are wondering what the function of our body is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without a body we would be a phantom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As human beings, we need a tangible physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having such a body, we are normal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, God created us with a spirit to take Him in, a soul to express Him, and a body to contain ourselves in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For His purpose, God had to create us with these three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>MAN S FIRST SIN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 1 we see God s creation, and in Genesis 2 we see clearly that God s intention in creating man was that man would receive Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in Genesis 3 the tempter came in to stir up the enjoyment of the soul, tempting Eve with the fruit that would make her like God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The aim of this temptation was to arouse the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the soul is selfish, it becomes the self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is altogether right to have a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when the soul desires something for itself, it becomes selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The soul was created by God for the purpose of expressing Him, not to have its own enjoyment or preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Nee put out a book entitled The First Sin of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man s first sin was not adultery, stealing, or murder; it was taking something according to his own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To take fruit was not wrong, but to take fruit according to the preference of the soul was the activity of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, man s first sin was to do something for himself, to satisfy the self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To repeat, the soul was made to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when the soul does something to satisfy itself, it becomes selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason we must deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To deny ourselves means to reject the soul s desire, preference, and choice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever the soul wants something for itself, we must deny the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The desire of the soul for something for its own satisfaction was the cause of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By taking the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man fell, and his soul was ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The soul created by God for the purpose of expressing God had been ruined by the desire of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because of this, the spirit was defiled and became deadened, having lost its function.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, the body entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a complete picture of fallen man: the soul ruined, the spirit deadened, and the body subject to death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>RECEIVING THE SALVATION OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because we are in such a fallen condition, we need God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank the Lord that He has come in to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He put our nature on Himself and became the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Through His redemption, our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now God has a way to contact us and to bring us into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have been called, we have repented, we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we have been cleansed, and the Spirit of God has come into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, we have been reborn, and our deadened spirit has been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the salvation of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once we have received this salvation, we shall never lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is proved by 1 Corinthians 5:5, a verse that speaks of a sinful brother.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although this one had been regenerated, he fell into a terrible sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, Paul delivered him over to Satan that his flesh might be destroyed probably through sickness , but that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This indicates that once we receive salvation in our spirit, we cannot lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The salvation of our soul, however, is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our spirit has been saved in this age, and we cannot lose this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But it is not yet determined whether or not our soul will be saved at the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Unlike the salvation of the spirit, the salvation of the soul is not a matter of simple faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>By confessing our sins, believing in the Lord Jesus, and calling on His name, we are regenerated and have salvation in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But the salvation of the soul requires a long process.</S>
