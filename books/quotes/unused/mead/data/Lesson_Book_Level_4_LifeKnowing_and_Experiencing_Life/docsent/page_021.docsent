   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Text I. THE SENSE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every kind of life has sense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a baby is born, immediately, he has the senses of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although his senses may not be strong, nevertheless, he begins to have and is developing these senses such as feeling, hearing, seeing, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we are regenerated, we also have the sense of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We call that the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sense is just the sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this sense we know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The experience of life has much to do with knowing the sense, developing the sense and living by the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The Scriptural Basis</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Bible does not mention explicitly the sense of life, yet it actually speaks of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse speaks to us very clearly concerning the sense of life, for the peace mentioned here is clearly a matter of consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This peace does not refer to the outward environment, but the inward condition; therefore, it is definitely a matter of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the peace mentioned here is a matter of feeling, the death and life mentioned here are also a matter of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sense of death is due to our minding the flesh, while the sense of life and peace is due to our minding the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we live in the spirit, follow the spirit, and mind the spirit, we feel strong and satisfied within; at the same time we also feel lively, bright, comfortable, and at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, if the Holy Spirit gives you a feeling, and you mind and obey it, you will feel strong and satisfied within; at the same time you will feel lively, bright, comfortable, and at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, you will have the feeling of life and peace, because you mind the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second place in the Scripture concerning the matter of the sense of life is in Ephesians 4:19, which says that the Gentiles "having ceased from feeling have given themselves over to lewdness to work all uncleanness in unbridled greedy lust.''</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This tells us that the reason the people in the world commit sin and do wickedness at will is that they have forsaken all feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a man sins and does wickedness, we cannot say that he has no feeling, but at least we can say that he has laid aside his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more one commits sin and does wickedness, the more he must lay aside the inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, an evil, wicked man is void of feelings, whereas a good and kind person is rich in feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now, whose inner sense is stronger, the Christian's or the Gentile's?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must answer that our feelings are much stronger, because, in addition to the feelings they have, we have the feelings of life within us, which they do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, if we sin and commit wickedness, we must have laid aside our feelings even more severely than they.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this very reason, the Scripture exhorts us not to cast aside all feelings as do the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Scripture thus beseeches us that we might take care of our inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This of course emphasizes heeding the inner sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, almost all the Epistles of the apostles have words of blessing and greeting in which grace and peace are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Grace is God gained by us, and peace is the feeling of having gained God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God gained by us to become our life and for us to enjoy is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This grace within us results in peace; it causes us to have a feeling of peacefulness within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the apostles wished that the people might have peace, it means that they wished the people might have the peace of the inner sense, or peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The inner sense of peace is the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, when they expressed their wish that the people might have the feeling of peace within, they wanted them to pay attention to the inner sense of life.</S>
