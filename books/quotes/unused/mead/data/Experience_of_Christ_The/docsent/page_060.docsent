   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I once read an article that said that some power at the center of the universe is holding the universe together.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before his experience on the road to Damascus, Paul did not have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He treasured the law and was zealous and righteous according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But one day his eyes were opened to see the excellency of the knowledge of the wonderful One.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Compared to Him, all other things are dung, dog food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Paul was one of the "dogs" in Judaism, he needed dog food.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But when he became a son of the living God, he had no further need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In its place, he had better food, the wonderful Person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are no longer dogs feeding on refuse; we are sons of God feeding on Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
