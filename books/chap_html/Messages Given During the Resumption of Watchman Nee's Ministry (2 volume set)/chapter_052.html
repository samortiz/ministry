We can do nothing. What we need is Your presence. Only the operation of the Holy Spirit will bring about Your work. Lord, we are gathered together in Your Name. You are surely with us. If we give Your light the ground, You will surely shine on us. You will surely cause us to touch You. We pray that You will stop Satan from occupying any ground in man's mind.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 57:15; Matt. 1:21-24; Eph. 3:17; 2:22; 1:23; 3:10; Rev. 1:5b-6; Eph. 5:25; Matt. 16:18-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH&#151;<br>GOD'S DWELLING PLACE IN SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Becoming a Man to Dwell among Men</H2><P>Brother Chen Keh-san:God dwells in the most high place. As far as space is concerned, He dwells "in the high and holy place" (Isa. 57:15). As far as time is concerned, He "inhabits eternity." In terms of space, when one reaches the highest place, he reaches God's dwelling. Airplanes can only fly as high as ten thousand feet or thirty thousand feet; they can go no higher. But God dwells in the highest place. He is also the One who exists from eternity to eternity. He is like a circle that has no beginning or ending.</P><P>The wonderful thing is that this God who dwells in eternity one day came to earth to become a man and to dwell among men. His name was Emmanuel (Matt. 1:21-24). The Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God was coming (Luke 17:20). They were the hypocrites. The Lord could not say to them that the kingdom of God is in their hearts. Their hearts were full of dead bones. The Lord is the King of the kingdom of the heavens. Yet He dwells among men. Where the Lord is, there is the kingdom. This is why the Lord says that the kingdom of God was among them (Luke 17:21). This means that the Lord was among them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God in Christ Dwelling in the Church</H2><P>Christ was in the flesh for only a few dozen years. After He died and resurrected, He produced the church. The producing of the church can be likened to the producing of Eve out of Adam. When the Holy Spirit came, He dwells within the believers and also within the church. Today, God dwells among us through the Holy Spirit, and here we have the church. At the same time, the church becomes the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:22). All the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ (Col. 2:9). Everything in Christ is everything of God. Christ is like a bank, and God is like the deposits in the bank. If Christ "goes under," God will become poor. Suppose I put my watch, my pen, and all my money into this handkerchief. Either you take the whole thing, or you get nothing. This is God's way. God does not give fragments to man; He gives the whole thing to man. When a man receives Christ, he receives life, forgiveness, and so forth. If he does not want Christ, he will have nothing. Today, when we believe in Christ, we receive all the riches. Everything is in Christ. With Christ, we have everything. Without Him, we have nothing.</P><P>When I have the sunlight, I do not need the little flashes of the torchlight any longer. Today, God's glory dwells in Christ, and Christ is in us. What can be more glorious than this? Even if the head of a nation were to walk with us, that glory would not be a glory when compared with the glory of Christ. On the contrary, it will become a shame.</P>
