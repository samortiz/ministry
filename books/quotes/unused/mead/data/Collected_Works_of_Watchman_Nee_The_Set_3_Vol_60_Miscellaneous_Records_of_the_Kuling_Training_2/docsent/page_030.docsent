   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO CREATE A SENSE OF NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider a few ways to create in man a sense of need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finding Rest</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 11:28 is a verse frequently used by gospel preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse has saved many people, both in China and in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to use this verse to challenge men: "Are your burdens heavy?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are you toiling?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you long for rest?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to make them feel the burden of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to show them that human life is full of many burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today man is anxious over many earthly things; he is full of burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The human life is indeed a restless life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A poor man has anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A rich man has even more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A poor man is conscious of the pain of want, while a rich man worries that his money will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have few possessions worry much, and those who have many possessions worry even more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The human life is indeed a suffering life, but the Lord said that He would give rest to those who come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we speak about this verse, we can testify, saying, "Since I believed in the Lord, my burdens are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I now have rest."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should also ask seven or eight others to give their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will generate a sense of need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The majority of people must have a sense of need evoked within them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse has saved as many people as John 3:16 has.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a good way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Joy and Satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than rest, we can also preach the gospel by talking about the need for joy and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can use John 4:13-14: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people are never satisfied; they are always conscious of the vanity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A man can increase his wealth, but this does not increase his satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Money, children, and friends cannot satisfy man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The world is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a man does not have something, he wants it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he has it, he quickly becomes thirsty again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before a man in this world receives the Lord, he pursues after satisfaction all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He can be satisfied for a few days, but very shortly he will be at the end of himself and thirsty once again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is like a child who wants some toys before receiving them, yet tires of them once he receives them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything of the world can offer man only temporary satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After a man drinks of it, he will be thirsty again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is like the Samaritan woman who was not satisfied even after having five husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After saying this, we have to ask the brothers to give their testimonies; they have to speak of drinking the living water through receiving the Lord, of finding true satisfaction, and of being thirsty no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we use this way to preach the gospel, we will create a need for joy and satisfaction in some.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They will see that they do not have the joy that others have, and they will feel their need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we place joy in front of those who do not have joy, the joyless ones will hunger for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most Japanese are saved because they see the joy in the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to preach the gospel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, we have to drink and be satisfied first.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must receive the living water and joy from the Lord before we can create this sense of need in others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On Death</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Death is also a good topic for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Death is fearful, and it is common for men to be afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Among the Chinese, every young person is afraid of death, while most old ones are not afraid of it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a phenomenon peculiar to the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>An old person regards death as understandable and inevitable; most are not afraid of facing death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Among young people, however, the fear of death is prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When preaching to young people, death is a good subject.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we are with many young people, we can preach about death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can testify to them that Christians are not afraid to die because we have a Savior who enables us to overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A sinner, however, does not have the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If he dies, what will happen to him?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christians are a great testimony; they are a living testimony of men who are not afraid to face death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Church history testifies how many Christians sang and praised God at the time they were about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They knew that angels would come and receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When a believer dies, he should declare, "I am not dying.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am temporarily leaving this earthly home to meet my Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These are good testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Death comes to every man once Heb 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>An unbeliever may ask, "What is to become of me after I die?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No one can escape this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All young people are afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They do not know what to do when death comes to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In preaching the gospel, we can use death to create a sense of need in man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only should we speak of death, but also we should tell others the truth concerning the Lord Jesus' death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has tasted death for everyone 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He has defeated the devil, the one who has the might of death v. 14 . Those who believe in Him are released from death; they will no longer be under the slavery of death v. 15 . They can boldly declare, "Where, O death, is your sting?" 1 Cor 15:55 . We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has removed the taste of death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This will make them sense their need for deliverance from the bondage of death.</S>
