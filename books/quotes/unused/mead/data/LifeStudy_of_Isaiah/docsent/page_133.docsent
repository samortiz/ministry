   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. His Reproductive Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaiah 53:10b-12a speaks concerning Christ's reproductive resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Seeing a Seed and Extending His Days,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and the Pleasure of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prospering in His Hand</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"He will see a seed, He will extend His days,/And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand" v. 10b . The seed here is the church, comprising all the believers produced as the many grains by the death of Christ as the one grain and His reproductive resurrection John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 . He was the one grain who died to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although He died as a single grain, He resurrected with many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His resurrection, therefore, was very productive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 53:10b says not only that Christ will see a seed but also that He will extend His days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today Christ is extending His days by living in His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His believers are His extension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we may sing these words: "We are Thy continuation,/Thy life-increase and Thy spread" Hymns, #203 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand" v. 10c . The pleasure of God is to see many sons born of Him to become the members of Christ, who constitute the church as the corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the greatest pleasure to God, and it depends altogether on Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 11a says, "Because of the travail of His soul, He will see/And He will be satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What will Christ see, and with what will He be satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ will see the church and be satisfied with the church, just as Adam saw Eve and was satisfied with her Gen 2:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Isaiah 53:11b continues, "By His knowledge, the righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many,/And He will bear their iniquities."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ did not justify us foolishly or blindly but according to His unlimited knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that to be justified by Christ is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He justified us, He exercised His knowledge and considered such matters as how we would be related to God and how we would affect the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After much consideration according to His infinite knowledge and His complete and perfect discernment, He justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For Him to justify us means that He accepted us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since Christ has justified us by His knowledge, He surely bears our iniquities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is responsible for us in the heavenly court.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a great many sins, but because Christ has decided to justify us, to accept us, He is willing to bear all our sins.</S>
