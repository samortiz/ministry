   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Be glad over her, O heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because God has judged judgment for you upon her."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Saints" may refer more to men of the Old Testament; "apostles," to Christians; and "prophets," to those from the second Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>R. Revelation 18:21</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence and shall be found no more at all."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although it is not known how God will destroy Babylon, it is possible that this will be done by an earthquake because in 16:19 He remembers the great Babylon after a great earthquake.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Wherever there is an earthquake, there is usually fire; hence, the kings of the earth and the merchants see the smoke from afar but cannot help 18:9 .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>21b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 18:23b-24 three reasons they are actually sins are given for God's judgment of Babylon:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 "For your merchants were the great ones of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 "For by your sorcery all the nations were deceived."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3 "And in her was found the blood of...all who have been slain on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The error of today's commerce is that, instead of balancing the wealth, it entices people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, it is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sorcery is to communicate with the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the future, Rome may become the center of such activity.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. Revelation 19:1</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"After these things" means after the complete destruction of Babylon.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah means "Praise the Lord" in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why "Hallelujah"?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because salvation and glory and power have now come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. Revelation 19:2</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"For true and righteous are His judgments."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This matches "righteous and true" in 15:3.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are "true" because God judges according to the real situation; they are "righteous" because God judges according to the proper method.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The verses which follow cite God's judgment of religious Rome the great harlot as a proof that God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. Revelation 19:3</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"And a second time they said, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And her smoke goes up forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Naturally, the smoke of Rome will cease, but her punishment will last forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>D. Revelation 19:4</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>19:1 ; then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures join them, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows that they are different from the great multitude in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The great multitude in heaven speaks of salvation, glory, power, and so forth, clearly indicating that the church is included.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows that the twenty-four elders do not represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From this point on there is no more mention of the twenty-four elders, because they resign from their office at this time.</S>
