   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE DEFINITE STEPS FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY MAKING THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A PART OF OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past our church life has been too dead, and not many people have functioned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even when some did function, they functioned in a formal, religious, and organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church life has not been a part of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, in the past when a person wanted to be baptized, we arranged for a baptismal meeting, set up a formal fa ade, prepared the baptistery, and baptized the person in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of our meetings were conducted in a proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There were definite ones assigned to call a hymn, sing, pray, or preach.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything was in order, yet when such meetings were dismissed and the saints returned to their daily life, there was no change in their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There seemed to be no connection between the church life and their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, everything is changed now.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there are two hundred people meeting in a hall, all two hundred people need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One can be baptized anywhere and at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church life has become a common everyday affair and is easily within everyone s reach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a practice vitalizes the church life and increases its impact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Recently Sister Lee said to me, After dinner tonight I will go and watch my old classmate be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She was saved, and tonight she will be baptized at hall six.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I asked, Is there a baptismal meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She answered, No. This is very different from what we used to have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this is still not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be more spontaneous and normal so that our church life is a part of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that every day the saints will see people baptized into the Lord in their own bathtubs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will bring a great revival into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE PRACTICAL STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TO CARRY OUT THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have spoken about the burden for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we will go one step further to consider the practical steps to carry out the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, I would recommend that the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers conduct a survey in their area this week.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They must gather up all the records on file for the saints and take a census of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every year the number in the church fluctuates.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some saints have moved away, and others have moved in. Some dropped out of the church life because of their circumstances or their physical weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have not been able to stay abreast with the church life because of their work or schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many have lost contact with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must consider these situations one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These saints have all been baptized into Christ, and they once met with us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is easier and more profitable to contact these than to contact new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although they may have drawn back or become cold because of their weaknesses or other reasons, they are nevertheless the Lord s children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As far as responsibility goes, we have no excuse; we must take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the past it was our lack of concern or shortage of care that brought them to their poor condition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a shortage on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the Lord is leading us to recover the organic function of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the business not only of the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers but also of every child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The new way that the Lord is leading us to take today is a way in which everyone functions organically, every member operates effectively, and every home serves fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do this, we will nourish and care for more people, and the church will increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After such a census, the elders should announce in the meetings that they intend to create a file of all the saints who reside in their area, whether or not they have been meeting regularly with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even those believers who no longer live like believers, but live like heathens, should have their names in this file.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do this, a hall with two hundred members may suddenly find itself with more than five or six hundred names.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After this, the elders, co-workers, and full-timers should take the lead to divide up the regular attendants into groups to make a grand sweep.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This may be compared to conducting a spring cleaning, where lost stationery and other items are found one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the saints must visit the homes one by one to find and recover the lost saints who were saved many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After such an initial visitation, the elders should assign the saints to care for and revisit the lost ones based on the strength and capacity of the saints and the practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders should call a meeting, gather the brothers and sisters together, and present the real situation to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They should be charged to pick up the burden to seek the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If all the brothers and sisters do this, even though we may not witness a complete success, the results will be decisive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there are too many names and the assignments cannot be completed in one meeting, they can be distributed gradually at other opportune times.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may take hall sixteen as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At present, there are about two hundred saints meeting in fifty homes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there are two hundred fifty dormant ones, every home will need to take care of only five names.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such a burden will not be too heavy on any one home.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If every home is faithful to rise up, in a short time more than half of these dormant ones will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the one thousand homes in the church in Taipei will all do this, recovering one person per week, one thousand people will be recovered every week.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe if we work faithfully and diligently in this way, in three months we will recover at least a third of these dormant ones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, this is the first thing that we need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that the elders will practice this immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Gather the records of the saints together, classify them, and convey the burden of the care for these dormant ones to the brothers and sisters through local conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The elders should consider each home as a unit and in the meetings should solemnly charge the head of each household to take care of these names.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They should charge the head of each household to pick up the burden to lead the entire family to pray for these names.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To be sure, as long as that home will pray for these people, every spirit in that home will be revived and rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I believe the Lord s grace will accompany this work, and the Spirit of the Lord will join us in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do this, in three months we may recover three thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From now on, we cannot take care of our work in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must work according to a schedule with a proper budget.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our goal is that in three months we will recover one-third of the dormant ones.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do this three times, we will need only nine months to recover most of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Where there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It all depends on whether we are willing to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be sure, if we do not clean up our house, the house will be a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If no one sweeps, surely we will find trash everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, if I sweep a little, you sweep a little, and every person and every household takes care of its sweeping, the cumulative result will be a clean neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In everything, the most difficult step is the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we are to do this, the responsible brothers must take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must go back to our halls to stir up the spirits of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do not speak in a general way; that will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Instead, we need to plan out a definite course of action and work out a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For example, we can set a goal of recovering one-third of the dormant ones in the first three months, the next third in the second three months, and finally the last third in the last three months.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The elders and the co-workers must be definite and scientific in the way they work.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must pass out the records to the saints, take the lead in the practice, and supervise the work every step of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must not merely give orders; that will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Learn to fellowship with the brothers and sisters and offer some practical suggestions and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>These dormant saints were baptized by us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They are our responsibility, but for many years we have neglected them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This was our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Now the Lord has given us a new leading and a new practice to make up our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should all rise up to respond to this.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Of course, this does not mean that we should ignore the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should still take care of the Lord s Day morning meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>For the sake of those who need such a meeting, we should not dismantle this structure.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>However, we should pay attention to the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The small groups are our life pulse.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must give our all and be desperate for the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Although it is not easy to overturn tradition, we should look to the Lord s blessing, and we should pray that the home meetings will bring in a success in the near future.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The principle of the New Testament is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In the New Testament, God cannot do anything without the cooperation of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I have never heard of anyone being saved through an angel alone; the preaching of the gospel must come through human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In Acts 10 the angel could only tell Cornelius to invite Peter to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If I were Cornelius, I would have said to the angel, Since you are here already, why not preach the gospel to me directly?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Are you not more qualified than Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Why don t you preach to me?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The interesting thing is that the gospel must be preached through human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It must be preached in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>What I fear the most is our spiritual teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I cannot tolerate such spiritual teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>These teachings say that we should not do anything in an artificial way.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We should not promote anything, but we should look to the leading of the Holy Spirit and the prompting of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I would ask the ones who have taught such teachings, Where is the result of your looking and waiting?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Thirty years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Where is the result?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we are to meet the practical needs, we cannot settle for mere theories.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we continue to wait, Taiwan will not be evangelized in another thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The dormant ones will remain dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We need to wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The older elders and co-workers among us have been waiting and seeking for the Lord s leading for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Some of our sons have become elders during this time, but what has become of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I hope that we will all wake up and realize that this is a dead-end street.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We should not be stuck in a blind alley.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We should not wait to die.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Even if we were to wait until the Lord comes back, our waiting and seeking would result in a dead end. We must take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We are frustrating the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The timing is not in the Lord s hand but in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Any time we rise up to work, the Lord s leading is there.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>What is the Lord s timing?</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>It is whatever time we stand up to do something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>My fellowship today is not meant to be a yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Everyone can practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>It is not a burdensome yoke for each family to take five names and joyfully visit them as believers in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>It is a light burden.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>In practice, when the saints go out to visit, we can tell them that they do not need to make all five visits in one evening.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>They can visit these families one at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Neither is it necessary to knock on their doors; they can first call them on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>As long as we persist steadfastly, we will surely see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>This is the principle of spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>All living things grow in small increments, yet eventually such growth fills the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Now the Lord has shown us a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We need to overturn our old practices and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>This is not merely a diversification movement, but a turn to make everyone grow and function.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>I hope that we will take this advice and carry it out in a practical way.</S>
