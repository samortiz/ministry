   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE VISION OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph 4:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this precious hour that we may come to learn the way of Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>O Lord, You know that our heart is full of gratitude for Your mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We bow before You to confess that we are still sinful, that we are still in the old nature, and that we are still so much in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How much we still have self-seeking, self-interest, self-righteousness, and self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, how much we need Your cleansing!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we have no merit, no good, for us to stand on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But, Lord, we have Your blood as our covering and as our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, grant us a living word to speak something about Your mystery, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, grant us the inner grace that we need for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much we need You as the inner grace!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Lord, draw us to love You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, draw us to go with You that we may be one with You and may be built up as Your living Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, deliver us from so many distracting elements and frustrating things and deliver us from our self that we may be truly one in Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, You know that we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We look to You for Your help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Your precious name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter we come to the third vision, the vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before we consider this vision, however, let us review what we have covered regarding the vision of Christ and the vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CHANGED FROM TRADITION TO VISION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that the real service, work, and ministry that we could render to the Lord must be something of the heavenly vision, not something traditional, religious, or natural.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the first chapter we pointed out that in the first part of his life, Paul's service was according to tradition and religion and was without vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He had the confidence that he was serving God, but he was serving according to the letter, knowledge, teaching, and regulations of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after he received the heavenly vision, his service, work, and ministry were changed from tradition to vision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He served no longer according to the traditions of his forefathers or according to knowledge and regulations but according to the heavenly vision, the present vision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Galatians 2 Paul went up to Jerusalem not by regulation but by revelation, by vision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had come to see something, so he went up to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we read his Epistles we can see that Paul was a man full of visions.</S>
