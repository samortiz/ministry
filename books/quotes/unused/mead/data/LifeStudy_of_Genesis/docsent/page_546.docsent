   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-SEVEN BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 2 g Prophesying with Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider another manifestation of Jacob's maturity in life: his prophesying with blessing 49:1-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we are familiar with what it means to prophesy, we may not be familiar with prophesying with blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 49 is the only chapter that reveals this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33 is close to what is found in Genesis 49, the blessing there is not as rich as the blessing here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both portions of the Word are prophecies concerning Israel, but in Genesis 49 there is a richer blessing than in Deuteronomy 33.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prophesying in chapter forty-nine is a manifestation of maturity, for our speaking always reveals where we are and how mature we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A baby cannot speak at all, but a child over a year old may begin to say a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His speaking reveals that he is a small child.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the same with other age groups: a young man speaks like a young man, a middle-aged person like a middle-aged person, and a grandfather like a grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, our speaking not only represents our age, but also the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are quick, you will not speak slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are slow, you will not speak quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are a high person, you will not speak in a low way, and if you are a low person, you will not speak on a high level.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, our speaking reveals what we are and where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It has been said that the wisest thing to do is not to speak at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I stood before a group of people without saying anything, they would not know whether I was deep or shallow, quick or slow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would be a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, during the past fourteen years, every fiber of my being has been revealed to you all through my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even children seven or eight years old know me rather well because they have listened to my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because I speak so much, I am not able to conceal myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best way to conceal yourself is not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During my early years in the ministry, I was quite wise, for I never said anything in the conferences of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because that was my policy, I was a mystery to the other co-workers, and no one could understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it is difficult to speak, it is more difficult not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the opportunity presents itself, you simply will not be able to refrain from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I doubt if you could stay with me for sixty minutes and not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am certain that after a few minutes you would be speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now let us briefly trace the matter of Jacob's speaking as it is revealed in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first record of his speaking is in 25:31, where Jacob said to Esau, "Sell me this day thy birthright."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gaining the birthright was the desire of Jacob's heart; it was his dream and aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For a long time he had been waiting for the opportunity to get it away from Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the opportunity finally came, the first word out of Jacob's mouth recorded in Scripture was the word about selling the birthright.</S>
