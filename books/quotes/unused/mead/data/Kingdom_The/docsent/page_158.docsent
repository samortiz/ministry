   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PURITY OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to Matthew 6 where we find the fourth aspect of the reality of the kingdom the purity of the children of the kingdom in their good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The children of the kingdom do good deeds, and in their deeds there is no mixture, falsehood, hypocrisy, or pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, there is purity, singleness, and simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the kingdom life, there is nothing pretentious, nothing false, and nothing hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here again we see the wisdom of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The purity of the children of the kingdom operates in three directions: toward others in the giving of alms, toward God in prayer, and toward ourselves in fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning others, we need to give alms to take care of their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning God, we need to pray, not for our interests and affairs, but to pray, "Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth" 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This prayer is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In principle, the prayer of the children of the kingdom should be something for God, to God, and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning fasting, we must deal with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fasting is not related to sins or sinful things, but to lawful things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is lawful for us to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who is born has the right to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we fast, we deal with ourselves by renouncing our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean we deal with ourselves because we are wrong, worldly, sinful, or fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We simply want to be dealt with by sacrificing our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Toward others we give alms, toward God we pray, and toward ourselves we fast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are the three categories of the good deeds of the children of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we do these things, we need to be pure and sincere, not hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is hypocrisy?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "hypocrite" comes from the Greek word which means an actor who is assuming another character.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the ancient custom among both the Greeks and the Romans, stage actors spoke through a large mask in order to increase the force of their voice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So hypocrisy is an outward falseness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It indicates something exaggerated and unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It also implies to propagate with publicity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both in the world and also in Christianity, nearly all of the money is raised in the way of propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was in a certain city, the brothers who lived there told me about the way a so-called church took to raise money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They would call a general meeting and present the need to the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They would then ask for whoever could afford to give the largest amount to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The rich members, grasping an opportunity to display their wealth and generosity, would stand and offer a large amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This method was very successful because it suited the fallen human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 6:3 the Lord said that when we give alms we should not let our left hand know what our right hand is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means we need to give in a secret way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is absolutely contrary to the practice of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some Christian groups even print reports showing the names of those who contributed the "love offerings."</S>
