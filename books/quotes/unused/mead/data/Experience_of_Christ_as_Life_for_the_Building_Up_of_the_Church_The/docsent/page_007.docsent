   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Incarnation accomplished redemption, and resurrection imparts life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was by the step of incarnation that He became a man John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a man He was the Lamb of God lifted up on the cross in the form of a serpent to take away sin and to deal with Satan in His accomplishment of redemption.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We might wonder how we fallen sinners could be a part of Christ's glorious bride.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We become a part of this glorious bride by redemption and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 3 shows us the start of life and the consequence of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The start of life is to be regenerated by receiving redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consequence of life is to enter into the kingdom and become a part of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By being redeemed and regenerated we have entered into the kingdom of God and have become a part of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TRANSFORMATION BY DRINKING CHRIST, FEEDING</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, chapter twenty tells us how to breathe Him in. As we breathe Him in, we are refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the real refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be refreshed by Christ day by day.</S>
