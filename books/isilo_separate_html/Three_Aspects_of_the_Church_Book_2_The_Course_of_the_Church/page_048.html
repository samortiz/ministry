<h2 class="head2">The Turn in 1900</h2>
<p>In 1900 there was an important turn in the history of the church in China. The Chinese were opposed to foreigners, but according to the treaties, the government was supposed to protect Westerners. This agitated the people; some among the Chinese rose up to form a group called <em>I Ho Tuan,</em> which means &ldquo;Boxers United in Righteousness.&rdquo; They were very superstitious and practiced Chinese martial arts. The Boxers&rsquo; slogan was &ldquo;Support the Ching Dynasty; destroy the foreigners,&rdquo; and they had the approval of the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi. The movement eventually led to the Boxer Rebellion in northern China, in which Western missionaries and Chinese believers were killed.</p>
<p>The Boxers called foreigners &ldquo;primary devils&rdquo; and Chinese believers &ldquo;secondary devils&rdquo;; they targeted these two groups for slaughter. The greatest number of martyrs was among the missionaries of the China Inland Mission in Pingyang Fu of Shansi Province. There the church in China encountered its greatest persecution; it was also the greatest purification for the church in China. Many Chinese had joined the Christian religion out of an impure motive; however, many loved the Lord with a pure heart. During this time of persecution, many Chinese believers shed their blood and tears to maintain a good testimony for the Lord.</p>
<p>The worst method of persecution was the roadside worship test. The Boxers would set up an idol image at an intersection and require everyone that passed by to kneel and worship the idol; whoever refused to worship the idol would be dragged to the side of the road and beheaded. Such murders were not considered illegal; on the contrary, they were supported by an imperial edict. Believers in all the major cities in northern China experienced persecution at that time, and those in the cities in the province of Shansi suffered the most. Because the governor of Shantung Province, Yuan Shih-kai, was more experienced with the outside world and was able to deal wisely with the imperial court, the believers in Shantung Province were not harmed as much as in the other provinces. During that time many false believers and weak believers were stumbled; however, many true believers stood strongly for the Lord and were a good testimony for Him. We must recognize that the year 1900 was a great turn for the church in China. Before that time, no one in China had ever clearly risen up to testify for the Lord, and there had not been any manifest servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>In 1911 the Nationalist revolution was successful in overthrowing the Manchu government, and the government of the newly formed Republic of China actively promoted a scientific culture; this benefited Christianity in many ways. The Chinese people became more open-minded, and public opinion changed. Because the environment had changed, the condition of the churches also changed. Thus, many strong witnesses for the Lord were raised up among the believers in China.</p>
<p>The Boxer Rebellion in 1900 was a great turn in the church in China. The first stage, or the beginning stage, of the church in China was the time before 1900. When the Boxers began killing Christians in China in 1900, the church in China entered its second stage. The second stage lasted from 1900 to 1925. During this time, God raised up many people because of two main reasons. First, the atmosphere in China became more open, and the Chinese were more receptive to Western culture. Second, when the Manchu government fell in 1911 and a republic was raised up, great changes occurred in things like culture, thinking, education, and theories. These changes were environmental, and although we do not emphasize them, they were undoubtedly a factor in the spread of God&rsquo;s church in China.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of seed we sow, its growth does not merely depend on the attributes of the seed itself but also on factors such as soil, climate, sunshine, and rain. God&rsquo;s seed of life is the best seed, and it was sown into the soil of China through the preaching of the gospel, but the development of the seed needed a change in the environment and the cooperation of the soil. China&rsquo;s backward, traditional, and stubbornly closed condition initially prevented the full development of the seed, but eventually there was a great change in Chinese society, popular opinion, and cultural atmosphere. This prompted the raising up of many witnesses.</p>
<p>The proper beginning of the gospel in China dates back to 1850. In the half century from 1850 to 1900, the Lord graced China with many good evangelists. When Robert Morrison came to China in 1807, he was hardly able to preach the gospel at all, so we cannot say that the gospel work in China began with him. It was not until Hudson Taylor came to China in the 1860s that the gospel work in China had a good start. Brother Hudson Taylor&rsquo;s biography shows that God sent him to preach the gospel to the Chinese. Others, like Hunter Corbett and Calvin Wilson Mateer, loved the Lord and suffered for the gospel, even to the extent of giving up their lives. They testified before both God and man. They were purely for the gospel and not for anything else.</p>
<p>By the twentieth century missionaries were sent to China by Western mission boards, and the situation was very confused; all kinds of people were mixed together. However, in the confusion, God preserved some who genuinely sought to bring the gospel to the Chinese people. Mr. Woodbury, of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and Griffith John, who preached in the middle parts of China, were such ones; they were faithful in bringing the gospel to China. The situation was similar to that of the church after the day of Pentecost; although there was mixture, there was also the element of pure gold.</p>
<p>During this time period, the Chinese were dissatisfied with the Western missionaries who came to China for a number of reasons and generally had a negative impression of them. In my school, I used a history textbook published in America that stated clearly, &ldquo;The missionary boards are an instrument of imperialism.&rdquo; We asked our professor about this statement; he was an American missionary sent by a mission board. This humble brother confessed that this statement, along with many other things written in the textbook, were regrettably true. Although this was the case, many missionaries were purely for the gospel.</p>
<p>Related to the mission boards sending people to China, I hope that we can see more than that they were numerous and confused; we should see that there were also many precious, pure missionaries. These precious missionaries sacrificed their all for the gospel and were purely for the Lord, without a heart for anything else. Therefore, by the end of the nineteenth century, the seed of the gospel was properly planted among the people of China.</p>
<p>Because Brother Hudson Taylor sent missionaries into the inland regions of China, the gospel spread to many places, even Szechwan Province. The work of the China Inland Mission in Shansi Province was very effective, spreading even to northwest China. They brought the good seed of the gospel and planted it in the soil of China. That pure seed was not mixed with things like the establishing of schools or hospitals. Therefore, by 1900 Satan became angry and raised up the Boxer Rebellion to damage the gospel. We can speak of two aspects of the Boxer Rebellion. First, from a nationalistic or Chinese viewpoint, the Boxers had some justification for what they did; however, Satan used their uprising to kill many Christians. Second, through the Boxer Rebellion, the Lord did a work of purification and continued to raise up more believers.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
