   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After a while, another one came.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This was the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unlike the other two, this one came journeying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The priest came by coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Levite also came by coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Samaritan came journeying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He came purposely to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"And when he saw him, he was moved with compassion."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had love, and he had compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time, he had oil and wine with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, he could heal the one beaten by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who is this Samaritan?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 4:9 tells us that the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone mentioned in this story was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one beaten up by the robbers was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The priest was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Levite was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What do the Jews represent?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And what does the Samaritan represent?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Jews represent us human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What about the Samaritan?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Samaritans have no dealings with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not mix in with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are apart from the Jews and above the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that this One is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day when the Lord Jesus was on earth, a group of Jews criticized the Lord Jesus and reviled Him with two very strong statements, saying that He was a Samaritan and one who had a demon John 8:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please notice that in Jesus' answer He said that He did not have a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Jews said that He was a Samaritan and had a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord denied that He had a demon but did not deny that He was a Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the Samaritan here refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John shows us that in type He is a Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Samaritan came purposely to this half-dead man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he saw the man, he was moved with compassion, and he saved him with two things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One was wine, and the other was oil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He poured out the oil and the wine, put them on the wounds, and bound up the wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to see that this is after Golgotha and after Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it were at Bethlehem, it would have been the wine on the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But since Jerusalem and since the house of Cornelius, it is the oil on the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Wine represents the work of Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oil represents the work on the day of resurrection and the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wine is symbolized by the cup at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you become sick, what the elders bring to your house is the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is represented there is what is spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, wine is the work of redemption, and oil is the work of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Wine symbolizes the blood of the Lord in redeeming us, and oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit applying the work of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it were only the oil poured without the wine, there would be no foundation for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there were no oil, salvation would not have any effect.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the cross, it would have been unrighteous for God to forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It would mean that He was dealing with our sins in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It would mean that He was glossing over our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But without the oil, though God may have accomplished redemption in His Son and may have solved the problem of our sins, that work could not be applied to us; we would still be wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we see that there is oil, and there is wine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, the oil is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the Holy Spirit who has applied the work of the Lord upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the procedure of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is the oil that is mingled into the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Holy Spirit does nothing other than convey the Lord's work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many of our sisters are nurses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We also have two brothers here who are doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you know that the function of the wine is altogether negative?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is used as a disinfectant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that the redemption of the Lord is to deal with past filth and past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The oil is there to help the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here, on the one hand, there is the removal of what was in the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the other hand, there is the new life from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only by this can the dying man be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I will speak more concerning this matter if I have an opportunity later.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After the good Samaritan bound up the wounds of the man beaten by the robbers, what happened next?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He placed him on his own beast.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The beast denotes traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With a beast, you can travel without exerting much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When there is a beast, I do not have to travel by my own effort; the beast will carry me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Where did the beast go?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It went to the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This inn is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When this man is brought to God, God cares for him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What is the meaning of two denarii?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All the metals in the Bible have their meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Gold in the Bible signifies God's nature, life, glory, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brass in the Bible signifies God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All the places in the Bible that require judgment have brass.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The altar was brass, the laver was brass, and the brass serpent was brass.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord's feet were as shining brass; they are for trampling.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the Bible iron signifies political authority.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But silver throughout the Bible signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Every time redemption is mentioned, silver is there.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the Old Testament, the money paid for redemption was silver.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The two denarii here signify the price of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The two denarii were handed to the innkeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because of this, God has accepted all those that trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Spiritually speaking, the inn signifies God's heavenly house.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Physically speaking, it signifies the church.</S>

   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>These points are not my main subject, but I mention them in passing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The lawyer asked the Lord, "Who is my neighbor?"</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After the Lord told him this story, He replied to the lawyer with a question, "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If you listen carefully to this word, you will realize that the Lord is telling the lawyer that he was the one who fell into the hands of the robbers.</S>
