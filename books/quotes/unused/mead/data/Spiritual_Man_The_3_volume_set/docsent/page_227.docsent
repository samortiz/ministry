   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE DESIRES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Desires comprise the greatest part of our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These desires join together with our will and cause us to either rebel against or dislike the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we have too many desires, our feelings become confused and we are unable to quietly walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our desires arouse our feeling, causing us to have many restless experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before a believer is set free from sins, his desire is united with sin, and he loves sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the new man is put in captivity, losing his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even after he has been delivered from outward, apparent sins, his desire still pursues many things for himself, independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he is emotional, he is governed by his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unless the cross works deeply and the desire is judged by the enlightening of the cross, the believer will never live completely in the spirit for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a believer is soulish, he is under the strong direction of his desires.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The natural and soulish desires of man are all related to the self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are either for self, by self, or according to self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the believer is soulish, his will has not yet submitted to the Lord, and he still has many ideas of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To desire is to cooperate with one's own ideas, to delight in all the ideas of one's will, and to desire one's ideas to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All self-pleasure, self-glory, self-exaltation, self-love, self-pity, and self-respect come from the desire of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man's desire makes self the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider: is there anything which man desires and likes that does not correspond to any of the "selfs" noted above?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would check our desires under the light of the Lord, we would see that no matter what we desire or how we desire, we cannot escape from the word "self."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of our desires are for the self!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They either make the self happy or bring glory to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When believers are in this situation, there is no possibility for them to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE NATURAL DESIRES OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Pride comes from desires.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The desire of man causes him to seek a position for himself so that he can be glorified before men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Any hidden tendency to boast of one's position, family traditions, health, disposition, ability, appearance, and power comes from man's emotion desire .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To consider how one's dwelling, clothing, and eating are different from others and, consequently, feel self-fulfilled is also the effect of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even considering that a gift one has received from God is superior to that of others is a thought urged by the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, how the emotional believer loves to show off!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He loves both to see and to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He cannot tolerate restraints from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He uses every means to push himself from the back to the front.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He cannot be hidden according to God's will nor can he deny his self in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He loves people's attention.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His desire of self-love is hurt whenever men do not honor him, but he is full of joy when he is esteemed by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He loves to hear people praising him and considers such praises to be well-spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in the work, he tries to exalt himself in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is always a secret motive stirring him whether he is giving a message or writing a book.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In short, his heart of vainglory is still alive; he still seeks after what he loves and what inflates his self.</S>
