   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ASCENSION AND PRAYER I. THE ILLUSTRATION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Old Testament typology, both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, or the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The altar of offerings being in the outer court indicates that the cross is accomplished on the earth; whereas, the altar of incense being in the Holy Place indicates plainly that the standing of prayer must be in the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer is not performed in the earthly sphere but in the heavenly sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we humans are on earth and seem to be praying on earth, every prayer that is acceptable to God should be uttered in the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The outer court is good for offering the sacrifices, not for burning the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The burning of incense is to be carried out in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The altar of incense is not positioned in the outer court, but in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This tells us that prayer must be in the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE POSITION OF ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection is a life, whereas ascension is a position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we speak of resurrection, we need to know that it is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, whenever we speak of ascension, we must understand that it is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 2 says that we the believers having been made alive together with Christ, were also raised, ascended, and seated together with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be made alive means to obtain life, to be resurrected is to live in life, and to be ascended is to gain a heavenly standing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, since we are clearly on earth, how can we be seated together in the heavenlies with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must know that, in the original Greek, "heavenlies" here does not refer to the physical heaven, but indicates a kind of heavenly state, heavenly atmosphere, and heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Location-wise, of course, we are not yet in the heavenlies today; but according to state, atmosphere, and nature, we are definitely in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the meaning of the "heavenlies" spoken of in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have arrived at such a heavenly nature and heavenly state in the resurrected and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is our position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us give an illustration here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose I visit a United States colony in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here the language, the food, the housing, the people, and everything they do are typical of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Geographically speaking, I am in the Philippines, not the United States; but the atmosphere and nature make me feel that, without a doubt, I am in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, "heavenlies" in Ephesians 2 does not refer to a place but to a kind of atmosphere and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, on the other hand, the "heavenlies" also denotes the place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone who prays must see that ascension is a position, and that such a heavenly position means a heavenly atmosphere, a heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE AUTHORITY OF ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The position of ascension produces the authority of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anyone in any kind of position has the authority which corresponds to that position.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even a servant has the authority as well as the position of a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A policeman has the position and the authority of a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A teacher has the position and the authority of a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we need to see that ascension is a position, and with such a position there is the corresponding authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spiritual life of a Christian is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, it is not only a matter of power but also a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Life brings in power; while position brings in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Resurrection is a matter of power; whereas, ascension is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to have a certain measure or kind of authority you need to be in a certain position.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are in the heavenly realm, you will spontaneously have the heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All our genuine prayers are the exercising of heavenly authority in the heavenly position.</S>
