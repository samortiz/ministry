   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to realize that all of us are little serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times the husbands and wives appear as serpents to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord rebuked the Pharisees by calling them serpents and a brood of vipers Matt 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus not only died on the cross instead of us to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also died there with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He died there with us, He died there with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He died on the cross with the human nature, and in this way He destroyed the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all have to praise God for His sovereign wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan thought he received the profit by entering into man's flesh, but he did not know that he put himself into a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day the Son of God came to be that trap in form and He brought this trap to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No human word is adequate to fully explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is too great and too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Bible does speak of this in Romans 8:3, John 3:14, and Hebrews 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the flesh, Christ dealt with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the flesh, Christ dealt with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the flesh, Christ dealt with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Judicially speaking, in God's governmental administration, the flesh with sin, with death, and with Satan has been fully crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may ask me why this flesh still remains with us when it has been dealt with and crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because it still has some usage for God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Judicially speaking, it is over, but practically speaking, it is still needed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not needed for God, but needed for you to force you to turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is sitting on the throne judicially, and the troublesome flesh of His chosen people has been dealt with judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His government there is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But practically, all His children, while they are still on this earth, need this troublesome flesh to help them to turn to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no such thing as good flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as there is not good dung and bad dung, there is not good flesh and bad flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Flesh is just flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are bothered by the flesh and forced to turn to the spirit, God is happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may have thought that after you believed in Christ, everything would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after a period of time, you may have become the most miserable person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may even wish that you had never become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may want to forsake Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But thank the Lord that once you get caught by the Lord, you are caught forever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In one sense, to be a Christian is a joyful thing, but in another sense, we are not very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether we are happy or not, we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the meetings we may be really happy, but are we happy when we get back home in our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be in a conference is like being on the mountaintop with the Lord Jesus, but to go back home is to go back to the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to the meetings, we are coming up, but when we go back home after the meetings, we are going down.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need a proper realization of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not dream that everything is wonderful in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My burden is to wake you up from this dream.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not dream anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to realize that while we are still on this earth, we need the help of the flesh to force us to turn to Christ in our spirit.</S>
