   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE SPIRIT'S APPLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST'S DEATH AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ITS EFFECTIVENESS Scripture Reading: Rom 8:9-10; 2 Cor 4:10a, 11a, 12a; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a; 5:24; Rom 8:13b; Matt 16:24; Rom 8:6b; Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4b; 1 Cor 15:36; John 12:24; Rom 8:13b; 2 Cor 4:10-11</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we want to see the Spirit's application of Christ's death and its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very mysterious, but it is definitely revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ, the person, and His death and resurrection are one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is logical, but it is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why is it that Christ's resurrection and His death are one with Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we had only Christ without His death and resurrection, we would have a Christ without a way of application.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's riches, Christ's contents, are altogether wrapped up with His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We saw in the previous message that Christ, His death, and His resurrection are compounded together in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This compounding makes Christ, His death, and His resurrection one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE REAL HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to see the great importance of the compound Spirit and of its application, we need to see the major items in the history of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the universe, first there was God, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even in eternity past, God was triune.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible shows us that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God and that They are eternally coexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal Triune God created the universe, but the universe was altogether outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God still remained by Himself in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God and the universe were fully separated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God was in the universe, but God stood alone, by Himself, leaving His universe also alone by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man was made in God's image and according to God's form Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After creating man, however, God still existed apart from the universe and from man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though man was bearing His image and form, God still existed by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God and man were separate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man lived apart from God, and man was not united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>About four thousand years after the creation of man, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was conceived in the womb of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Conceiving is a mingling, a blending.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>About two thousand years ago, the unique God, who had been existing for a long time, came into man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That was the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Incarnation brought divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through incarnation the Triune God was not only united with man but also blended with man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The issue of this blending is a man in the universe who is the mingling of God with man, and His name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is God and man mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God, in Christ, is mingled with man.</S>
