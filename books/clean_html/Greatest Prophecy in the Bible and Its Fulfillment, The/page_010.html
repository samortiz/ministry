<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO DROP ALL THE LEGAL DOCTRINES</h2>
<p>Many Christians know that we should keep the oneness according to Ephesians 4:3, but they do not know how to keep the oneness. The following verses show us that to keep the oneness of the Spirit is to drop all the doctrines. The doctrines are just like toys to children. Children like toys, and the younger they are, the more toys they have. But the more they grow, the more toys they drop. If an older person is still playing with toys, this obviously indicates that he did not have the proper growth in life. All the different doctrines are toys. The more you grow, the more doctrines you will drop, because doctrines cause division. Instead, you will stick yourself to the faith. This is the way to keep the oneness.</p>
<p>If we mean business with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today to afford Him an opportunity to recover the proper building, we have to drop the doctrines. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have dropped all the doctrines. As long as you still hold any kind of doctrine, you have to realize that, at least to some extent, you are divisive. Some kind of divisive spirit still remains in you. Let me say again that if we mean business with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of His building of the church, there is the requirement for us to say, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care for doctrines. We care only for the enjoyment of Christ.&rdquo; I am burdened that the real situation of the building up of the church be made clear to all of us.</p>
<p>When we say that we need to drop the doctrines, this does not mean that we do not keep the truths in the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Ephesians 5:22 says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands,&rdquo; and verse 25 says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives.&rdquo; To drop the doctrines does not mean that we do not have to keep words like these. The sisters have to submit themselves to their husbands, and the husbands among us have to love their wives. But we do not make these things doctrines that we insist on. For instance, a number of sisters among us practice putting a covering on their head when they pray, but we do not insist on this doctrine for receiving others. Today if anyone asked me to baptize him, I would immerse him, but I do not insist that he be immersed for my fellowship with him. To drop the doctrines does not mean that we do not keep the Word. If you insist on a doctrine for receiving others, this doctrine becomes a dividing element. We have spoken the truth concerning pray-reading, head covering, the laying on of hands, baptism, and the Lord&rsquo;s table, but we have not insisted on any of these things as a doctrine for receiving the believers.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11 there are at least fifteen verses on the matter of head covering (vv. 2-16). Based upon this, whenever a sister prays or goes to contact the Lord, she would cover her head to keep the Word, but if she insists on this to make it a doctrine, this is wrong. We keep the Lord&rsquo;s word, but we do not make anything in the Word a legality, a kind of legal doctrine. I practice pray-reading very much, but if anyone among us would make pray-reading a legal doctrine, I would be the first one against it. I also call on the name of the Lord, but it is altogether wrong to make such a thing a legal doctrine. We have no doctrine of calling or of pray-reading. It is all right if some want to speak in tongues, but if they make tongue-speaking a doctrine, that is wrong.</p>
<p>I have to try my best to make the real situation clear to all of us. We have no doctrine. We have only the practice of keeping the Word according to our pure conscience. Our consciences do not function on the same level. Let me give you an illustration. In Romans and in 1 Corinthians, the same apostle taught us in different ways about the eating of sacrifices offered to the idols (Rom. 14:1-3, 20-23; 1 Cor. 8:4-13; 10:23-30). In some of the verses, Paul said that you should not eat the sacrifices offered to the idols. But in other verses Paul said that you may eat. Eventually, it all depends upon your conscience. If you have a proper conscience and feel that you are free to eat, then eat. If you have a kind of conscience that makes you feel that you should not eat, then do not eat. All these things are up to our pure conscience.</p>
<p>We need to allow one another to live before the Lord according to our conscience in doctrinal matters (Rom. 14:1-9). The Southern Baptists may say that we are neglecting the great commission of the Lord in Matthew 28:19, but the Quakers, Presbyterians, and Methodists do not consider this verse in this way. How Christians consider Matthew 28:19 depends upon their different kinds of realization. Those who do not feel that this verse is the great commission should not be considered heretics. A heretic is one who does not believe that the Lord Jesus is God, the Son of God. These are the modernists, who also do not believe that Christ died on the cross for our sins or that He was resurrected. They are really heretics. But as long as someone has the proper faith in the Lord Jesus, he is not a heretic.</p>
<p>If your conscience tells you that you have to keep a certain verse of the Bible, you should do it. But never make that a kind of doctrine, saying, &ldquo;In our church, all people have to do this. Otherwise, we don&rsquo;t receive them.&rdquo; Sisters, do you practice head covering? If you do, that is wonderful, but do not make your practice a legality for receiving others. If some want to practice sprinkling, we will not oppose them, but they should not make this a doctrine and spread this doctrine among the saints in the church. If they do, they will cause division. If you want to speak in tongues, that is okay. But if you insist that everyone speak in tongues, you will cause division. If you wash others&rsquo; feet, that is fine, but do not say, &ldquo;All the elders are not so faithful to the holy Word, because they do not practice foot-washing. Surely they are wrong, and this is not the proper church. The proper church must have foot-washing every time before the Lord&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; If you do this, you have made a legal doctrine that causes division. If you want to pray-read, this is wonderful, but do not make this a legal doctrine by forcing others to do the same thing and imposing it upon others. This is altogether wrong. I have to say this because the number of saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be increasing more and more in the coming years. Those of us who may be considered as the foundation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to be clear.</p>
<p>I respect not only every verse but also every word of the Bible. But I have the full boldness to say that I do not make any verse a legal doctrine. We keep only the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith. We love the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We respect the Bible. As long as our conscience tells us that we have to keep a certain verse, we do it. But we never make that a doctrine. If we make any doctrine a legality, this will frustrate and hinder the fellowship among us. We keep the living Word, but we have no legal doctrines. We keep the Lord&rsquo;s Word not in a legal way but in a living way. We keep only the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith.</p>
