   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE CROSS GENUINE SPIRITUAL SEEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NOT OBTAINED BY FEELING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Question: I realize that it is wrong to say that we have not seen anything of the Lord s death on the cross, yet I feel that our seeing is not clear but rather blurry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I also realize the time of our seeing is not in our control; it is in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is our responsibility while we are waiting for light?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Shall we simply go on according to our blurred seeing even if we may fail?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: Your problem is that you analyze too much in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are three parts to your question.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You indicate that your vision is somewhat clear but blurry, that you have seen something but not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You want to know what to do before you see further.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to what you have seen, you think that you could fail and be discouraged, but you still want to go forward by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that you are both clear and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have seen something, but what you have seen is somewhat clear and somewhat blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since what you have seen is not thorough or sufficient, you will fall, but after falling you will still want to rise up by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are clear concerning these points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your second question relates to what you should do before you see more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother, you need to stop these distracting thoughts; these thoughts are the very reason you cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The moment you stop this kind of thinking and analyzing, you will be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Seeing is the issue of three things: revelation, light, and sight.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation and light depend on God; we cannot produce them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, sight is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who have eyes should see, and those who have ears should hear Mark 8:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that we are responsible for our seeing and hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must confess that we already have revelation and light; now the responsibility of seeing lies with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are our eyes open or closed?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are they clear or blurry?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are they transparent or opaque?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are they focused or distracted?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is not responsible for the condition of our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, this responsibility is altogether on our side; we must bear it completely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may use an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose someone prepares a meal and sets it on the table; our only responsibility is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can bear this responsibility for us, not even God; only we can bear this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The revelation is here, and light is here, but if we want to see, we need the light of God to shine on our inner eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, according to our experience, we are easily distracted and disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our anxiety keeps us from seeing, our analysis keeps us from seeing, our knowledge keeps us from seeing, our slothfulness keeps us from seeing, our indifference keeps us from seeing, and our begging of the Lord keeps us from seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you want God to bear the responsibility for your seeing, you may pray, O God, save me from all the distracting and troubling thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But eventually, you need to realize that even after such prayer, we must still bear the responsibility for our seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should all be clear that spiritual seeing does not rely on our physical eyes or our soulish mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we rely on our physical eyes and our soulish mind to see spiritual things, we will be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This brother is confused in the matter of spiritual seeing because he has over analyzed his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we must stop our distracting thoughts and learn to simply follow the light that the Lord has given us; the simpler we are, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we hear that the Lord s death on the cross has dealt with all things, we should simply bow our head and say, O Lord, I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not analyze in our mind, saying, I have seen only partially; I have not seen fully.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It seems that no matter what we have seen and how much we have seen, we always analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, in our analysis we anticipate that we will be unable to stand but, instead, will fall and be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, we want to continue to stand by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Anyone who analyzes in this way will be hindered from seeing the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps I have not answered your question directly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But my response shows you that there is no need to answer your question.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to answer your question, we would need to sit down together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, I would answer the first question, then after this I would answer another question, and then I would answer yet another question.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There would be question after question, but in the end, even after I have answered all the questions, we still will not be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is not a problem with the questions that are asked but with the person asking the question.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must stop your analytical mind; do not analyze any longer; stop all of your distracting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need to simply receive what you have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In fact, genuine seeing is not related to any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, at the time of our salvation, we opened our heart and received the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But at that moment, we did not feel that the Lord Jesus had entered into us, nor did we feel that there was something in us causing us to be joyful and radiant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Very few believers have a realization of being joyful and radiant immediately after receiving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some have this kind of experience, but it is not necessarily typical.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, when we look back after a period of time, we realize there was joy and radiance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we should not think that we have not received anything simply because we did not have an overwhelming experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, we did receive, but we simply did not have great feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, after hearing a message a brother may not have a strong feeling concerning what he saw, yet he does not analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He simply feels that he is full of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Before arriving home, he neither feels nor sees that all things have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, a test comes when his wife loses her temper with him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As he is about to respond, he immediately senses something within telling him to die.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He does not know how this sense entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only later does he realize that this sense was the all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the contrary, another brother is excited and joyful after listening to the message, because he has clearly seen that he has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On his way home, he tells the people in the car, I have seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When he arrives home and his wife loses her temper with him, he tells himself that he must not react because of what he has seen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This type of seeing is in the mind, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When food enters our stomach, are we in control of how long the food will stay in our stomach before entering the intestines?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Does it do any good to rebuke the food for lingering too long in our stomach or to tell it to enter quickly into the intestines?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord, who is in us, bears the full responsibility for us, and His word of life is like a seed that is sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Although we may not know or feel it, once this seed comes into us, it begins to operate within us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We do not need to teach or remind ourselves; we do not need to say repeatedly, I have seen it, so if my wife loses her temper with me when I go home, I must always remember that I have seen this fact: I have died with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, I must not lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Spiritual seeing is inwardly clear and outwardly blurry.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If a brother comes to us and says that he has the faith and the seeing, his faith and seeing are surely man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In brief, spiritual faith cannot be described.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What one believes can be described only after he looks back at his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When he is in the middle of the experience, he is altogether unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Please bear in mind that spiritual seeing cannot be understood by analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The more a person analyzes, the more difficult it is for him to see.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Spiritual seeing is not a mental exercise; it does not depend on our theoretical analysis and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Rather, spiritual seeing lies in the fact that a reality, something real, has comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Those who analyze with their mind often think that they are clear, but actual seeing does not necessarily involve much feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we are in the midst of a spiritual experience, we often are not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The more genuine a spiritual experience is, the less clear we are throughout the process.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, if we are clear from the beginning of an experience, our seeing is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In order to have genuine seeing, there must be a suitable condition, inwardly and outwardly, for God to shine in us, for the seed in God s word to be planted in us, and for the seed of God s life to be sown in us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When this seed is sown, we may call it seeing or receiving, and we may also say that this seed has been sown or shined into us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In any case, a certain spiritual matter has transpired within us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Once this spiritual matter is sown into us, it becomes our inward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Even though we may not have any feeling outwardly, within us there is a spiritual fact that cannot be denied, nullified, or overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Although what is sown into a brother may not give him much feeling, when his wife loses her temper with him, it will be manifested; he will sense that there is something within that kills him and prevents him from talking back to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>At this time, he will sense that there is an additional element within affecting him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He may not know when this element entered into him, that is, he does not realize if it came into him when he heard about the cross and the all-inclusive death of Christ or if it entered into him later.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>An even better example would be that when he is face to face with his wife and his wife rebukes him, he does not talk back to her loosely but later simply thanks and praises the Lord, without any realization of the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the best experience.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Even though he does not feel it, there is something real in him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Let us consider eating as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When food enters into us and supplies us inwardly, we do not have much feeling; it is at a time of hunger that we have feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The more normal a spiritual matter is, the less feeling we will have in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When a spiritual matter enters into us, outwardly speaking, we do not have any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>But when we have a need, this spiritual reality in us will meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If our situation is normal, we may not even have a feeling when a need is met within us.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>For example, a brother may be inwardly stopped from talking back to his wife after she scolds him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He may not realize that it is the Holy Spirit activating the effectiveness of Christ s death on the cross within him.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But when he looks back before the Lord, he will realize that this was an experience of the cross.</S>
