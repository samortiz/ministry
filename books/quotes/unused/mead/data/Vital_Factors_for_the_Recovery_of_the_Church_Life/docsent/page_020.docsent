   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Elders Not Lording It over the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders should not lord it over the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead, they should be patterns, examples, taking the lead to love the Lord, to seek after the truth, to grow in life, and to serve in the church Matt 20:25-28; 1 Pet 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They should not think that as elders they are rulers over the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Matthew 23:8-12 the Lord Jesus told us that all the believers are on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all are brothers, including the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among us there should be no lord except one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We only have one Lord and we only have one Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This unique Leader, the Lord Jesus, is our Guide, our Instructor, and our Director.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders are not lords governing the believers; all the elders are still only brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should set themselves up as a pattern, as an example, to take the lead in loving the Lord, in seeking after the truth, in growing in life, in preaching the gospel, and in serving in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GROUND AND THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ground of locality is the outward expression of oneness 1 Cor 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we all are meeting in Seoul, the city of Seoul is our ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this is merely the outward oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The inward reality of oneness is the Spirit Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must have the Spirit moving in us, living in us, and working through us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Outwardly we have the ground of locality to keep the oneness; inwardly we live by the Spirit for the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have only the ground of locality without the Spirit, we merely have something outward with no inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to have both the outward ground of locality and the inward reality of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GIFTS IN THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the local churches there are only prophets and teachers Acts 13:1 ; there are no apostles and no evangelists cf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 14:4, 14; 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the believers should be gospel preachers, but some members in the Body do have a particular gift to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are called the evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostles and the evangelists are universal and are for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the prophets and the teachers are local.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, in 1 Corinthians 14, a chapter concerning the local meetings of the church, the prophets and teachers are mentioned vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>26, 29 but the apostles and evangelists are not.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles and evangelists are universal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They travel from city to city preaching the gospel to establish the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this chapter I have presented a brief outline concerning the proper church and the proper practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As Christians, we all should be in such a proper church, and we should participate in such a proper practice of the church life.</S>
