<P>Christ died on the cross not only for our transgressions, wrongdoings, mistakes, offenses, but also for our sinful nature. There is an element or essence in our constitution, in our being, which is the inward sin. We are not only sinners; we are sin. Christ died for us as such persons (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is what I call the intrinsic significance and the intrinsic understanding of the death of Christ. We need to be brought into the intrinsic understanding of all the matters related to the death of Christ.</P><P>On the cross, Christ died for all of us (2 Cor. 5:14-15), He crucified our old man (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a), and He destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14). When we say that Christ destroyed the devil on the cross, someone may ask us how the devil can continue to work. First Peter 5:8 tells us that Satan, as a roaring lion, still walks about, seeking someone to devour. Christ did destroy Satan on the cross, but Satan still lives and acts. </P><P>In order to explain this, we can use what happens in a law court as an illustration. The verdict of the law court is one thing, but the execution of the verdict, the sentence, the judgment, is another thing. According to the verdict, someone may be condemned to death, but he is still living because there has not yet been an execution of the verdict, the judgment. Satan has been judged to be cast into the lake of fire. This is the verdict upon him. But the execution of this verdict, this judgment, is in the process of being carried out.</P><P>Today how do we apply God's judgment, God's verdict, upon His enemy? This depends on our spiritual condition and the spiritual degree of maturity we have. A person recently saved has not grown up and has not been perfected, or properly, spiritually educated, so he does not know anything about God's judgment, His verdict, upon Satan. But those who have been in the Lord for years know that Satan has been judged and that God has pronounced, or proclaimed, His verdict. Now in our spirit with a strong spiritual condition and situation, we can execute God's judgment over Satan. We can tell him, "Satan, you have been judged. The place where you should be is the lake of fire. Don't stay here." We have to execute God's judgment over Satan continually until the day that he is actually cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10). In order to fight the spiritual warfare in this way, we need much teaching, perfecting, and growth in the divine life. Although we are under Satan's attack, we are cooperating with the Lord to execute God's judgment upon him, and the Lord's recovery is still going on.</P><P>In His crucifixion, Christ also judged and crucified the world (John 12:31). In Galatians 6:14 the apostle Paul said the world was crucified to him and he to the world. In the eyes of the worldly people, including many of our relatives, our schoolmates, and our friends, we are finished. We are crucified. We do not count as being anything in their sight. To them we know only Jesus, God, and the Bible. This means that to the world we are crucified persons. The world is also crucified to us. We no longer have any interest in the world with its attractions and entertainment. Our unique interest is Christ Himself.</P><P>On the cross, Christ also tasted death for all things and reconciled all things to God (Heb. 2:9; Col. 1:20). Furthermore, He abolished the law in ordinances and slew the enmity between peoples (Eph. 2:15-16). Finally, in the positive aspect of His death, He released the divine life for the producing of the believers to constitute the Body of Christ (John 12:24). We need to learn to know all these things concerning the crucifixion of Christ in an intrinsic way.</P>
