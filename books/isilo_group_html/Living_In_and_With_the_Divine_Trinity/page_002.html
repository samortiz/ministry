As believers in Christ, we have such a marvelous, wonderful, excellent life, the uncreated life of God Himself, the eternal life. But we do not have much experience of this life nor do we have the adequate growth in this divine life. If we are going to experience and grow in the divine life, we must be those who are living in and with the Divine Trinity.</P><P>Even when we go to visit people, our burden is to bring the Triune God to them and share with them the Triune God. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged us to go and disciple the nations by baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the very person of the Divine Trinity. This is the purpose, the goal, and the aim of our going out to visit people. We want to impart our Triune God as grace and reality for salvation into the people we reach and bring the people we reach into the reality of the Triune God.</P><P>We all need a vision concerning the experience of the Triune God as our life. The Triune God in His trinity is for us to experience as our life that we may grow in this life. The Divine Trinity is absolutely wrapped up with the divine life. Actually, the divine life is the Divine Trinity. Apart from the Divine Trinity, there is no divine life. The divine life is a person, a three-one person. We must pay our full attention to the experience of the Divine Trinity as our life. Life is the Triune God.</P><P>The book of Ephesians reveals the church, and the church revealed in Ephesians is composed of and expresses the Triune God. The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians is constructed with and composed of the Divine Trinity (see the fifth paragraph of note 1 of 2 Corinthians 13:14&#151;Recovery Version). We need to see a vision that governs and directs us. It is not sufficient for us to have mere doctrinal knowledge. We all need to see a divine vision concerning the Divine Trinity, in and with whom we need to live. In this chapter we want to see the vision concerning the Divine Trinity in eternity without beginning, in creation, in incarnation, in the living and work in Jesus' humanity, in His crucifixion, in His resurrection, in His ascension, in His salvation, in the Christian life, in the church life, and in eternity without ending.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Living In and With the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
