[1]  The Church Being the Pillar and Base of the Truth for the Expression of God s Image and Authority
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; Psa 8:4-8; Heb 2:6-15; Matt 1:23; 16:15-19; 18:17-20; Eph 1:22-23; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rev 21:2-3, 10-11, 22-23; 22:1-2, 5b THE BURDEN FOR THE LORD S MOVE
[3]  In the Old Testament times God s people gathered together three times a year, but in the New Testament God calls His children together whenever the church makes a turn.
[4]  Our experiences in the recent years confirm this principle.
[5]  Whenever God leads the brothers and sisters from various places to gather together, we know that God is moving further in His church; He is making a turn in the church.
[6]  Therefore, we strongly feel that the Lord is moving once again, but we must not have outward spreading only; we must allow the Lord to work in us more deeply.
[7]  According to Genesis 1, when God created man, God said that He would make man in His image; then He said that He would let man have dominion over all things, especially over the earth and the things that creep upon the earth v. 26 . This means that God created man so that man would first bear His image and then represent His authority.
[8]  Genesis shows that in order to gain a corporate man, the first step in God s work was to create man.
[9]  Creation prepared the material and laid the foundation for the completion of God s work to fulfill His purpose.
[10]  The Bible reveals that God created man with three parts spirit, soul, and body; in this way we are different from all other creatures.
[11]  God s purpose is to enter into us so that we may have His image to express Him and His authority to deal with His enemy.
[12]  The creation of man was God s first step; it was merely the preparation for fulfilling His purpose, not the completion.
[13]  To accomplish His purpose, the creating God must enter into the created man.
[14]  However, before God could enter into man, the swift-footed Satan entered into man and damaged man through the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[15]  His body was exactly the same as that of the created man, but inside of Him was God Himself.
[16]  Just as in the beginning God created the first Adam and told him to be fruitful and multiply and to fill the earth, God wants the last Adam, Christ, to beget millions of Christs, a corporate Christ, the church.
[17]  There are two important books in the New Testament that speak of the church.
[18]  In the Gospel of Matthew, a book on God s dominion and kingdom, the Lord Jesus spoke of the church.
[19]  Quarrels and opinions in a local church are the issue of human relationships and the flesh.
[20]  However, a church that is lively and in full harmony yet does not give others the sense of God s dominion and ruling may also contain only the element of man and the things of man.
[21]  Some brothers and sisters may think that as long as there is a church, there is authority.
[22]  Our person, our self, must be subdued, broken, and crossed out by God because we still have many things in us that are not built upon Christ as the rock and instead are outside of Christ.
[23]  As the Lord enlightens us, He will touch us little by little, showing us that some things that are good and correct in us are not built upon Christ; that is, they are not built with Christ as the material, and they are not built up by Christ from within us.
[24]  The Lord must show us that our being is the greatest enemy of Christ and the greatest obstacle to Christ; we prevent God s authority from being expressed, and we nullify the church so that it cannot be formed.
[25]  First Timothy 3:15 says, If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[26]  Therefore, the church is not merely the pillar and base of the truth; it is also the mystery of God manifested in the flesh.
[27]  The church is not only redeemed; the church has two natures as the mingling of God with man and man with God.
[28]  The church is the enlargement of Christ, the God-man, the One who is God mingled with man.
[29]  On the day of Pentecost, those in the church were uneducated, insignificant men, but we can see that they were mingled with the almighty God.
[30]  The church is a group of people whose mind, emotion, and will may be quite strong and active; however, God is mingled with them, and they are mingled with God.
[31]  The Lord desires to build the church upon the Christ who is God yet man and man yet God.
[32]  The amount of the element of the church that we possess depends upon how much we allow the One who is both God yet man and man yet God to mingle and build in us.
[33]  Some brothers may be silent in the meetings, but this silence may be a virtue that is not mingled with God.
[34]  However, slow people must also allow God to touch them to know whether their slowness comes out of one nature or out of two natures, whether it comes out of themselves or out of their mingling with God.
[35]  When we live in God, when our natural element and personality are broken, and when we allow the mingling of God and man to be built within us, the building cannot be overcome by the gates of Hades.
[36]  The authority God gave man in His creation in Genesis 1 is manifested through the church in the Gospel of Matthew; the image God gave man in His creation is expressed through the church in the book of Ephesians.
[37]  God s image and authority are both expressed through the church.
[38]  We should never consider that an individual or a small number of people can express God s image or authority; God needs the church to express His authority, and He needs the church to express His image.
[39]  Although 1 Timothy 3:16 speaks concerning the Lord Jesus, it is connected to verse 15 concerning the church as the pillar and base that upholds God.
[40]  This shows that the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh, does not refer only to the Lord Jesus but also to the church, which is His enlargement.
[41]  Verse 15 speaks of the church, and verse 16 speaks of incarnation, because incarnation was enlarged when the church came into being.
[42]  In Bethlehem God was manifested in the flesh on a small scale in one man; in the church God is manifested in millions of people.
[43]  Godliness means God-likeness; it is to have God s form and to have the ability to express God.
[44]  If we lose our temper and act in our flesh, we do not have God s image; likewise, if we are good-natured, meek, and humble but have not been built in God, we do not have God s image.
[45]  We need the Holy Spirit to speak to us and enlighten us in an intense way so that we may see how much of God s image and God s element we have and so that we may see how much the church expresses the image of God.
[46]  Hence, Jesus Christ is the beginning of the mingling of God and man.
[47]  This man is a mysterious, universal man, who is God yet man and man yet God.
[48]  Experientially, it is possible for us to preach the gospel and speak concerning Christ yet not have God mingled with us in our preaching and speaking.
[49]  Even though we are saved, we may not have the reality of the Body of Christ.
[50]  On the one hand, as believers, we belong to Christ and are members of the Body of Christ; on the other hand, we should ask whether the Body of Christ is expressed among us.
[51]  Our Christian life is often a living out of ourselves, which lacks the mingling of the element of God.
[52]  We may have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and that, as members of the Body, our service should be corporate, not individualistic.
[53]  Without the Christ who lives within us, without the God who is mingled with us, we are individualistic, even if we do not desire to be individualistic, and we are unable to coordinate with others, even if we so desire.
[54]  This is not a matter of being individualistic or being in coordination but a matter of God being mingled with us and we being mingled with God.
[55]  From the perspective of the Body of Christ, if there is no expression of the element of God s mingling within us, we may not have much building, even if God s life is working within us, causing us to reject sin and deal with the world.
[56]  22-23 , and in chapter 2 he speaks of building v. 20 . From this we can see that God has been doing the building work after our salvation vv.
[57]  In chapter 3 Paul bowed his knees and prayed that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith v. 17 and that we would be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . We have been saved, yet we may not be filled; without the filling there is no Body of Christ.
[58]  The Body of Christ is the issue of the believers being built up with Christ, being mingled with God, and being constituted with Christ.
[59]  Whether they can touch the Body of Christ depends on whether Christ is built up in Taipei, whether God and man are mingled in Taipei, whether God is able to come out of man, and whether man s move is the move of God mingling with man.
[60]  One aspect is that it is the Body of Christ, and the other aspect is that it is the house of God, or we may say, the dwelling place of God, the temple of God.
[61]  All of God s children need to see that the Lord s expression of Himself and His work on earth do not depend upon our zeal and diligence but on whether we have the expression of the Body of Christ among us.
[62]  CHAPTER SIX THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 2:14-16, 18; 20-22; 4:11-13
[63]  Ephesians 2:14-16 says, He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition...that He might create the two in Himself into one new man...and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross.
[64]  Verse 18 says, For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.
[65]  Verses 20 through 22 say, Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[66]  In its verbal form, it means God is building ; in its noun form, it refers to the church as the building of God.
[67]  After the Lord s resurrection, the Holy Spirit descended and entered into man with God s life and nature.
[68]  On the one hand, the Holy Spirit uses God-created and God-redeemed people as material and gradually builds them into God; on the other hand, He gradually builds God s life and nature into them.
[69]  In relation to the building, God speaks of breaking down the middle wall of partition through the cross in Ephesians 2:14-16.
[70]  WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 4:12-13 THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST
[71]  John 1:16 says, For of His fullness we have all received.
[72]  Ephesians 4:12-13 says, For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[73]  These verses show that Ephesians speaks concerning the fullness of Christ twice at the end of chapter 1, where it speaks of the church being the fullness of Christ, and in 4:13, where it speaks of the church growing to the point of reaching the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[74]  We can also say that the love of Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth, because the love of Christ is God, just as Christ is God.
[75]  Paul could only describe this fullness with the breadth and length and height and depth, because it is truly indescribable.
[76]  Our only sense is that we were sinful and should have perished, but God loved us, forgave us, saved us, and gave us His life so that we may become His children.
[77]  When we were saved, we not only received life from God, but we also received the fullness from Him.
[78]  We do not sense that we have something within us called the fullness; at the most, we know that we have life within us, the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, Christ making His home in us, and God living inside of us.
[79]  Even if we are a new believer, we must ask the Lord to show us that we have the fullness within since we have received Christ s life: Of His fullness we have all received John 1:16 .
[80]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE PRINCIPLE OF GOD S BUILDING Scripture Reading: John 14:2; Matt 16:18, 24 WITHOUT GOD S BUILDING THERE BEING NO CHURCH
[81]  On the one hand, the church is produced by regeneration; on the other hand, the Bible clearly reveals that the church is produced by being built up.
[82]  The Bible rarely speaks of begetting the church, but in many places it speaks of the building up of the church.
[83]  God not only spends much time and effort in the building of the church, but He also speaks much concerning how He builds the church.
[84]  It is the tearing down of everything that does not belong to Christ and God, that does not match God, that cannot be mingled with Christ, and that usurps, occupies, and replaces the position of Christ in us.
[85]  In other words, everything that is natural in us, whether it is good or bad, able or unable to match God, must be torn down by God.
[86]  A person who knows God will see that every item used for God s building must be torn down; even the humanity that the Lord Jesus put on in His incarnation needed to be torn down.
[87]  The Lord Jesus incarnation brought God into man, causing God to be mingled with man; the Lord Jesus resurrection from death brought man into God, causing man to be mingled with God.
[88]  Abraham believed that God is the One who calls the things not being as being; he also believed that God is the One who gives life to the dead Rom 4:17 .
[89]  God does not have another building work, and He does not have another building.
[90]  God s only building work is to build Himself into the believers and to build the believers into Himself; this is His building.
[91]  We may never have had the thought that the only thing God desires to do in us after we are saved is to build.
[92]  CHAPTER NINE THE CONTENTS OF THE FULLNESS REVEALED IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN
[93]  LIFE, RESURRECTION, LIGHT, AND THE WAY Scripture Reading: John 1:16, 14; 11:25; 8:12; 14:6 THE CHURCH BEING
[94]  Everything of God is in Christ, and everything of Christ is in the church; therefore, the church is a great matter.
[95]  Everything in the Godhead is expressed through Christ, and everything that is in Christ is expressed through the church.
[96]  Just as Christ expresses God, the church expresses Christ.
[97]  Whatever is not God is not Christ, and whatever is not Christ is not the church.
[98]  If we touch the fullness, we will surely touch life.
[99]  In John 8:12 the Lord said, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[100]  The fullness has another content, which is light, and it has another sign, which is brightness.
[101]  Whether a person is in the fullness can be determined by whether he is full of light.
[102]  Whether a local church is an expression of the Body can be determined by whether that locality is full of light.
[103]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:9, 11-12; 7:25, 40
[104]  This building is not something apart from God, nor is it something apart from man.
[105]  If we have sufficient understanding of spiritual matters, we will know that God s building is to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself.
[106]  Simply speaking, it is to fully mingle God with man and man with God.
[107]  In other words, it is through death that God can enter into man, and it is also through death that man can enter into God.
[108]  What he lives out is merely a good man, a God-fearing man, and a man who is excellent in the sight of others but not a God-man and not a man who is mingled with God.
[109]  One who is truly in God s hand is one who has gone through hardships, sufferings, and has scars.
[110]  In such a person God has been doing a tearing-down work.
[111]  Incarnation is God entering into man, and death and resurrection are man entering into God.
[112]  God s building work in us has two aspects: one aspect is to build Himself into us, and the other aspect is to build us into Himself.
[113]  God s redemption does not nullify our humanity; it uplifts our humanity.
[114]  One who has not been dealt with by God may be weak in his will, but one who has been dealt with by God becomes firm in his will.
[115]  We need to look to God to open our eyes to see a spiritual fact and know the Body of Christ.
[116]  In this chapter, we desire to see further from John s writings that the content of this fullness also includes food, satisfaction, freedom, glory, and love.
[117]  The Lord said in John 6:48, I am the bread of life.
[118]  In John 8:36, Jesus said, If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.
[119]  There is another element in the fullness of Christ, which is to set people free.
[120]  When the condition of a local church is normal, when a local church is strong, the meetings will always give people the sense of freedom.
[121]  We cannot pretend in any spiritual matters, such as how much God has passed through us, how much we have allowed God to build, how much God is constituted into us, how much we have been broken and built up by God, how much God has been blended into us, and how much we have entered into God.
[122]  If we understand the Bible and touch God s heart, we will sense that in Genesis God was searching for a dwelling place; He could be compared to a homeless person.
[123]  The church as the Body of Christ must be one in order to express Christ and to allow Him to live and move.
[124]  If we do not have God s tearing down and breaking among us in the church and if we have not been built by God, constituted by the Spirit, and filled with the element of Christ, the church is not one in experience.
[125]  How do we keep and not damage the oneness?
[126]  Practically speaking, whenever we desire to take an action or express an opinion, we should ask ourselves, Am I in Christ in taking this action or expressing this opinion?
[127]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN GOD S TEARING DOWN AND BUILDING UP Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-13, 15-16; Col 3:10-11; Eph 2:15b THE CHURCH AS THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST
[128]  The church is the fullness of Christ, expressing Christ; wherever Christ is expressed, there is the reality of the church.
[129]  However, Christ cannot be expressed through a group of believers who are merely saved.
[130]  Paul s Epistles show that the church, as the fullness of Christ to express Christ, needs to pass through much building.
[131]  Believers who have not passed through a great deal of God s building work cannot be the fullness of Christ, and the expression of Christ will be limited among them.
[132]  Others may praise us, and we may be thankful to God, thinking that these virtues are the result of God s moving within us.
[133]  If a person has a ministry, has been commissioned by God, and is experienced in the Lord, having been dealt with and broken by God so that God has been built in him, he can differentiate between excitement and Christ and between zeal and Christ.
[134]  The work in the church of those who minister the word, who have the gift of ministry, is to tear down on the one hand and to build up on the other; their tearing down is their building up.
[135]  A great part of their work is tearing down.
[136]  It is to tear down everything that is natural, that is not of Christ, that does not have the constitution of the Holy Spirit, and that is not built by Christ into man.
[137]  They will tear down everything that is against Christ, replaces Christ, and usurps Christ s position.
[138]  God s Word reveals that the work of those who minister the word is to build up the Body of Christ; this building includes tearing down.
[139]  They know that God s work in the church is to build the element of Christ into the saints and that this building is entirely based upon the tearing down of everything natural.
[140]  God s work in the universe is to use the fullness expressed in His Son to build up the church as the Body of His Son, which is the fullness of Christ.
[141]  If we know the church, we will see that the church is the place where God is mingled with man and where man expresses God.
[142]  The content of the city is God Himself, the fullness of God; the expression of the city is also God Himself, the glory of God.
[143]  Therefore, we can clearly see in the light of the Holy Spirit that the content of the New Jerusalem is the fullness of God and that the appearance of the New Jerusalem is the glory of God.
[144]  The content of the church is the fullness of God, and the expression of the church is the glory of God.
[145]  Head covering is not an outward form; it is a real sign of our declaring that by God s grace we recognize God s authority and submit to His authority and to the establishing of His throne among us.
[146]  If a local church does not have God s throne, His authority, we cannot see His fullness, His mingling, or His expression.
[147]  The young ones may not submit to the elderly ones, and the elderly ones have not learned to submit to God s authority.
[148]  Even their enthusiasm and diligence are under God s authority, being restricted and ruled by God.
[149]  A local church is not for elders to make decisions but for God to exercise His authority; it is not a matter of the elders position but a matter of God s throne.
[150]  Revelation 22 shows the throne of God as the center of the New Jerusalem.
[151]  Ephesians 4:15-16 says, Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[152]  These two verses, which have a particular place in Ephesians, show the coordination of the Body of Christ, the growth of the Body, and the building up of the Body.
[153]  This word means that we need to love God and continually hold God in the love with which we love Him.
[154]  Concerning the authority of the Head, we must see that Christ is the Head, that we need to give Him the position of the Head, and that we need to recognize His authority.
[155]  We need to recognize Him as the Head in all things, whether big or small.
[156]  We need to give all authority to Him, submitting ourselves to His authority.
[157]  We have already seen that in order to have the fullness of God, we need to have God s authority, and that in order to have the coordination of the Body, we need to hold to the Head.
[158]  When we put these two together, we come to the following conclusion: there is order in the Body, and the coordination of the Body is mainly in this order.
[159]  All of God s creation is an expression of His sovereign authority.
[160]  We must not only submit ourselves to the authority of the Head; we must also maintain a proper relationship with all the members.
[161]  For example, our face is truly God s masterpiece; a cow s head, a horse s head, and even a flower are not as beautiful as the human face.
[162]  We should not expect the church to change; rather, there should be a change in us.
[163]  Outward changes are useless; we need an inward change in our being.
[164]  If we are round, God would put us in a square church; if we are square, the church will be a round church.
[165]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:26-27; 2 Cor 11:28-29
[166]  In the coordination of the Body there are four important points: we need to be joined to the Head, we need to carry out our function, we should not step beyond our limit, and we need to submit to authority.
[167]  Whenever we speak concerning the coordination of the Body, we must pay attention to these four points.
[168]  We need to cultivate a consciousness of the Body by fellowshipping more with the Lord.
[169]  Our inner sense will spontaneously be developed as we fellowship more with the Lord.
[170]  Furthermore, if we add obedience to this fellowship, our inner sense will become keener and richer.
[171]  We need to exercise the sense in our spirit to gain a sense of whether this person is humble and pure before God and whether God s authority is in him.
[172]  When we exercise the consciousness of the Body, a good situation will develop.
[173]  A member who is in a difficult situation will not bear his burden alone, but his fellow members will bear the burden with him.
[174]  We will no longer pray for someone simply because he asks us; rather, we will pray out of the burden in the Body.
[175]  Sometimes one person s prayer is not enough; there is truly the need for the prayer of the Body, but this prayer is still spontaneous.
[176]  There is such a thing in the Body that proves whether we are weak or strong inwardly and also proves the extent of our concern for the children of God, the members of Christ.
[177]  Question: How should a believer who has a harmonious marriage, obedient children, and an environment with no suffering or sickness pray if he wants to be broken?
[178]  Answer: We Christians should accept God s breaking when it comes, but we should not ask for the breaking.
[179]  Question: How do we know God s will concerning our marriage and our occupation?
[180]  Knowing God s will depends on the lessons that we have learned before the Lord, the degree of our consecration, and the condition of our consecration.
[181]  For example, our understanding of different things is dependent on our level of life, our human maturity.
[182]  We may be advanced in years, but if we are indifferent, having little understanding of spiritual matters and almost no heart for the service of the church, it will be difficult for us to know God s will.
[183]  Twenty years have now passed by, and we are still telling God s children that the church s rapture at the Lord s second coming is not a matter of time but a matter of the church being mature.
[184]  Question: Where will we be raptured to when the Lord comes back?
[185]  Today the Lord is in heaven; one day He will come down from heaven and take us up.
[186]  Question: In the coordination of the Body, how can we know clearly what our portion is and carry it out properly?
[187]  Answer: Concerning the coordination of the Body, we need to stress that every brother and sister must carry out their function.
[188]  However, while functioning, we should not trample others and step beyond our limit.
[189]  If we do not function, the coordination of the Body will be lost, but if we step over our limit and trample others, the coordination of the Body will also suffer loss.
[190]  We should be responsible for only one thing if we sense we are doing something that is not the result of God s tearing down, it is better to avoid it; if we sense that we are trampling others and stepping over our limit, we should stop.
[191]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[192]  Acts 2:42 says, They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
[193]  Ephesians 3:18-19 says, May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[194]  Colossians 2:19 says, Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.
[195]  Portions from the Word of God, such as 1 John 1, show that this fellowship is related to God s eternal life: The life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us v. 2 .
[196]  A brother once testified that he had fasted and prayed related to a difficult situation and a burden within.
[197]  This is a mystery that people in the world are unable to understand or comprehend.
[198]  They marvel at Christians who attend meetings every day, spending three hours in a meeting even after working eight hours in the office.
[199]  CONCERNING THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY Not Making Distinctions in the Fellowship
[200]  First, we should be careful never to distinguish between who is experienced and who is young when we fellowship.
[201]  If we fellowship only with those who are experienced and not with young ones, we will suffer much.
[202]  CHAPTER TWENTY SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF THE CHURCHES 1
[203]  As responsible brothers or as brothers and sisters who are co-workers, if we have any problems in life or in service, we should fellowship together and seek the Lord s leading.
[204]  Let us fellowship locality by locality concerning the problems in our localities or concerning the problems among the co-workers and responsible brothers.
[205]  Our lack of care is the reason for the low attendance in the meetings when there are so many brothers and sisters.
[206]  If we consider this matter from the perspective of gospel preaching, our situation is because we pay attention only to saving sinners.
[207]  Coordination in service is a matter of our need for the Lord s mercy; it is not a matter of doctrine.
[208]  We need the Lord s mercy so that as serving ones we would be willing to receive the inward shining and breaking before the Lord.
[209]  The number of people in the church in Kaohsiung is much less than in the church in Taipei, but in principle, all the problems mentioned above are also in Kaohsuing, and there may be even more.
[210]  Two years ago we reached one thousand four hundred saints, but today there are only a little over this number.
[211]  The matter of group leaders is the same in principle as leading new believers.
[212]  The co-workers and responsible brothers are often limited in their capacity to lead people; a person may be able to lead fifty people but not sixty.
[213]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF THE CHURCHES 2 FELLOWSHIP BY BROTHER LIN FROM TAICHUNG
[214]  Concerning the matter of service, the church in Taichung has the same problems as Taipei and Kaohsiung.
[215]  First, the attendance in the meetings is only about one-third of the entire church; most of the saints do not meet regularly.
[216]  We cannot make others spiritual, nor is there a method to make ourselves spiritual.
[217]  Nevertheless, those who serve the Lord need to bear a certain amount of responsibility.
[218]  The responsible brothers in each locality should have a thorough dealing with the Lord before every meeting.
[219]  I did this because I desired to enter God s presence so that I could touch Him and receive a burden from Him, not because I needed to give a message.
[220]  Concerning the brothers who are weak and not strong enough to bear responsibility in a locality, their being strong or weak is not an absolute matter.
[221]  No one who serves the Lord serves only after he has learned everything.
[222]  In our service, we should learn as we do, instead of doing after we have learned.
[223]  Even though we do not know how to do things, we will learn as we do them.
[224]  For example, the church in Taipei is a large church with a large number of saints, and there are about fifty full-time serving ones.
[225]  For example, some saints do not preach the gospel because they think that they do not know how to preach the gospel, some do not visit people because they think that they are not good at visiting people, and others do not shepherd people because they think that they are not good at shepherding.
[226]  The problem of the church in Tainan is exactly the same as other localities.
[227]  In recent days we have begun to feel that our vessels are too small; if we take care of one item, we cannot take care of another item.
[228]  In our daily church life, although we try our best to have good fellowship with the saints and give them a good leading, we are unable to supply them adequately.
