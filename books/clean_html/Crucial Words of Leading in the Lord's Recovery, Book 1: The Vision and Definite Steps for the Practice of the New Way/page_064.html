<h2 class="head1">HOW TO USE THE READING MATERIAL</h2>
<p>One point needs special attention: In selecting the reading material, we should precede each portion with a few crucial verses. Every time we meet together, we should first have the attendants pray-read the verses. This will plant the Lord&rsquo;s word into man&rsquo;s heart. His word is living, operative, and full of power. We hope that those who come to the meeting will receive nourishment and truth and will testify that we are here for the spreading of the gospel and the presenting of the truth.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the practice of pray-reading in the meetings. There are three to four meetings a week, and fifty-two weeks in a year. In time, the deposit will add up. As the saints pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s words into them, these words become a deposit in them and serve as their timely supply. We need to pay much attention to this. Never neglect this practice by saying that there is not enough time for pray-reading. No matter how long the meeting is, there should always be three to five minutes for pray-reading a few verses. Even if there is not enough time, we should still take care of this, because this is an indispensable element of the meeting.</p>
<p>In reading the publications, do not be dull or monotonous. A few ways of reading should be avoided. First, we should not have everyone read together except when we come across the crucial sentences. If the whole congregation reads through half a message or an entire message together, that will kill the meeting. Next, we should not have one person read through an entire paragraph. According to my experience, observation, and personal investigation, the best way to read in the small group meetings and the home meetings is for each one to read one sentence. This kind of reading may be difficult at the beginning, but in time it will become easy. I hope all the halls, small groups, and home meetings will promote this kind of reading. I would like to see this practice developed until it becomes our &ldquo;family tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery meet three to four times a week. In one year we meet more than two hundred times. For this reason, it is crucial that we learn to read the messages in a proper way. This can be compared to a ball game; with practice and training, there will be the improvement in skill. If the playing is capricious and there is no restriction and limitation, one can play for years and still not know how to play the game. Today the co-workers, elders, and full-timers must pick up the responsibility. We must take the lead to do it and to learn how to do it. I am asking that we take the lead; I am not asking that we replace others. I am asking that we do it <em>with</em> others, not <em>instead of</em> others. While we are doing it, we should point out the secret, the key, so that everyone can learn something. The co-workers, elders, and full-timers cannot be silent in the meetings. We cannot close our eyes and simply meditate. The meetings are the times when we &ldquo;play ball on the court.&rdquo; We need to take the lead to play ball. If the brothers and sisters are playing very well, we can step back. But if they are not playing in the right way, we need to step forward and render the timely corrections. Do not barge in or take over. Rather, teach others until they can play. If we spend time and effort to do this, the church will be built up by our work.</p>
<p>In teaching, we should help the saints to focus on the main points. Take John 3:16 as an example. It says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. We need to learn to bring out the word <em>gave;</em> that is a main point. Lead the saints to emphasize the word <em>gave.</em> Repeat that word. Learn to point out the main points. We do not need to spend much time to explain them. The saints will realize by our hints what the main points are. We must see that our exposition does not carry much weight. The most effective way is to bring out the Lord&rsquo;s word and have everyone pray-read it, directing everyone to the main points. In this way, we will provide everyone with the opportunity to function. No one will stand idle. In order to achieve this, we need to continually lead the brothers and sisters to practice this in the meetings. I believe that in fewer than six months the church in Taipei will produce a model for others to follow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO USE <em>TRUTH LESSONS</em></h2>
<p>In the past I pointed out that in teaching <em>Truth Lessons</em> we should not expound but should only read. The brothers are all very faithful. They took my fellowship. However, there are different ways to read. If we appoint one person to read one paragraph and the next one to read another, we &ldquo;hang ourselves by a noose&rdquo; with such a reading. What I mean is that if that person happens to read well, everyone will enjoy his reading, but if that person is a poor reader, the whole meeting will be awkwardly held in suspense. If that person does not exercise his spirit in reading, he will even kill the entire meeting. In teaching <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we cannot ask one person to read an entire paragraph.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Directing Everyone to<br />
the Main Points in the Reading</h2>
<p>I agree that at some crucial juncture we should ask everyone to read together. But the teachers need to control the speed of the reading. We must also direct everyone to the main points. When we come to the main points, we should read with emphasis. While it is true that the teachers should not engage in long expositions, they ought to direct everyone to the main points. From my observation, I have noticed that some teachers fail to direct people to the main points at the crucial junctures. Some are worse; they allow the readers to mumble inaudibly over these crucial points and do not do anything to correct them. The main points are thus completely skipped. Sometimes the main points are contained in only one sentence. The reader may read the entire paragraph but miss that one sentence. Some teachers allow such negligence to occur. This kind of teaching is very poor. It amounts to no teaching at all. If the teachers cannot direct others to the main points and if they allow them to be glossed over, why do we need these teachers at all? The job of the teachers is to direct everyone to the main points.</p>
<p>Take as an example lesson 14 of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> Level One, Volume 2. Almost all the teachers have committed the same mistake. The main point in this lesson is that the prophecies and types reveal Christ. There are many prophets in the Old Testament, and whether they speak in types or in prophecies, their focus is Christ. In Luke 24:44 the Lord Jesus told the disciples, &ldquo;All the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.&rdquo; In John 5:39 He said, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures...and it is these that testify concerning Me.&rdquo; This shows that the entire Old Testament is a testimony, typifying and prophesying Christ. Both the major prophets and the minor prophets have Christ as the focus and the highlight of their prophecies. Unfortunately, most of our teachers do not direct everyone to this point.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Asking Questions</h2>
<p>When we teach <em>Truth Lessons,</em> asking questions is an expounding, so we need to highlight the main points. When we ask questions, we should not ask about trivial matters. For example, we can ask, &ldquo;Which prophet had the most detailed prophecies concerning Christ?&rdquo; When people look at lesson 14 of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> they will find that Micah&rsquo;s prophecies concerning Christ occupy only a few lines. He prophesied concerning the birthplace of Christ, when He was to become a man in time, and the goings forth of His Godhead from eternity. But David&rsquo;s prophecies concerning Christ occupy one and a half pages. He spoke about the Lord Jesus from eternity past, passing through His creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, enthronement, coming back, and receiving the kingdom, all the way to eternity future&mdash;His years being without end. If we read the Bible carefully, we will find that even though the Gospels are rich in content, some matters related to Christ are not spoken of as clearly as in David&rsquo;s prophecy. For example, the matter of Christ&rsquo;s being a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec is not mentioned in the four Gospels.</p>
<p>When we focus on the prophets, we should ask the saints, &ldquo;How did this prophet prophesy concerning Christ?&rdquo; The main point of this lesson is that in the Old Testament there is a group of prophets who prophesied concerning Christ. The Lord Jesus clearly said that both the Law of Moses and the Prophets testify concerning Him. This indicates that the prophets in the Old Testament are for testifying Christ. Hence, when we compiled <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we put a special emphasis on this point in presenting the prophets of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on Main Points, Not on Dates</h2>
<p>Some saints are attracted by dates, and they pay much attention to memorizing them. This amounts to what Paul called &ldquo;unending genealogies&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:4). All the Jews were trapped by this, and Paul said that we should not engage ourselves in this. Of course, history has its place, but history merely tells us that something has happened. There is no need to argue about the dates. From my research and study of the Bible, I have found out that there are at least four or five different schools of identifying dates in the Old Testament history. They all differ by a few years. It is not only impossible to accurately identify dates from a few thousand years ago, it is also sometimes difficult to ascertain dates from only a hundred years ago. The dates are not the main points. The main point is Christ.</p>
<p>I say all this to impress us that we are not here to teach history, geography, or language. We are here to minister Christ. We are here to point out the things concerning Christ in the Bible. For example, in talking about the eight persons in the book of Genesis, we need to point out what we see in Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. If we can point out the focus of God&rsquo;s work in these eight persons, we will unveil the meaning of the entire book of Genesis. Throughout the ages many scholars have not seen this. They think that the Bible is a book of history, geography, or science; they have not pointed out the spiritual light hidden within these pages. This, however, is the main emphasis of <em>Truth Lessons.</em> We must spend time to enter into all these points.</p>
<p>At present, many places throughout the world are using <em>Truth Lessons.</em> In the United States, Europe, Australasia, and Africa, many places are welcoming this publication. They welcome it because it ministers Christ. It points out the things related to the Spirit and life. In teaching these lessons, we must minister Christ. We must point out the things related to the Spirit and life. Everything else is background material. The accessories that come with a diamond ring, such as the frame and the box, are important, but the focus is the diamond itself&mdash;its color, the number of carats it has, its shape, and its weight. In teaching <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we need to point out the focus and teach by bringing out the emphasis.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The key to the success of the new way is the spiritual material we use in the home meetings and the way we teach <em>Truth Lessons.</em> If we neglect these two points, we will not reap much result. The focus of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is Christ, the Spirit, and life. It is not history, geography, or linguistics. If we exercise these keys in a proper way, I believe we will reap a tenfold harvest. I hope that we will pray much for this.</p>
