<h1 class=series>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THIRTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(16)</h1><p>In this message I will give a further conclusion to the fellowship concerning the experience of life. This conclusion has two parts that we should remember. The first part is to remember that we now have Christ within us as our Partner all the time. We no longer live, behave, act, and have our being by ourselves. We must remember that the Lord is living within us. The second part is that we must remember what kind of person we are.<h2 class=head1>REMEMBERING THAT THE LORD IS WITHIN US</h2><p>The Christian life is a life of man being mingled with God. It is a life of two persons being mingled together and living together. It is not a matter of living a life by yourself. As a Christian you must always keep in mind that you are no longer by yourself. Another One is always with you as a Partner, both in the small things and in the big things. The unbelievers do not have such a One with them in their experience; therefore, they do not understand this kind of language. As you are in your daily activities, you should realize that another invisible One is with you and indwelling you.<p>Sometimes, we do not like the fact that He is dwelling within us because we are not able to do or say things so freely. When we are about to lose our temper, we have to consider Him. We must consider whether or not He likes to lose the temper with us. We have another One living within us, so we must live a life which never neglects, forgets, or disregards Him.<p>We must learn to always live a life with another Person inside of us. This should always be our spontaneous experience, but today it is still only our occasional experience. Without remembering that the Lord is within us, we may be free to like or dislike anyone according to our own choice. But when we remember that He is with us, our freedom is greatly reduced. Marriage reduces our freedom because we have to learn to live with another person. Before a brother marries, he is free to exercise his own likes or dislikes and to go wherever he likes. But after he is married, he always has another one with him. Quite often, the husband is frustrated from doing what he likes by his wife, and the wife is also frustrated by the husband. The husband may want to laugh, but because of his wife, he may not be free to do so. Before marriage, he had no such restrictions or frustrations, but after marriage, he has a lot of restrictions. Having a wife or husband really restricts our freedom, but our wife or husband can also be a great benefit to us, especially in the way of companionship.<p>From my youth, I have sought to know how to live the Christian life, how to be holy, and how to be victorious. I have read many Christian publications on this subject. Eventually, I found out that not one of the ways presented in these books was really prevailing. According to my own experience, only the way of remembering that He is within us really works. The problem we have is that we often forget that He is within us. During our daily life, we just do not remember that the Lord as another One is with us. But when we do remember and realize that He is within us, everything is okay.
