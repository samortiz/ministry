Chapters twenty-four through forty-four were given in the first training in 1948. The remaining messages were given in the second training in 1949. No specific dates are available for these later messages.</p><p>Chapters twenty-four through twenty-nine are records of question and answer sessions. Chapters thirty through thirty-eight are trainings on ways to preach the gospel. Chapters thirty-nine through forty-four are instructions for workers concerning the nature of the work.</p><p>Chapters forty-five through fifty-six are additional subjects for the new believers. They belong to the same series as Messages for Building Up New Believers (see Vol. Nos. 48 through 50). These records were only lately discovered in notes from Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and were not included in the earlier volumes of this work.</p><p>Chapter fifty-seven is a fellowship with the workers concerning the work. It forms the final chapter of these two volumes of The Collected Works on the training at Kuling.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Morning, July 2, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><p>Brother James Yen: If a man is depressed, discouraged, and bound, is it because his outward man is not broken? How should such a person break through his condition?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Two things can happen when a man is depressed in his spirit. First, when a man acts according to his outer man, he does not need to exercise his spirit. As such, this will not be a time when he feels any depression in his spirit. He may feel a sense of depression in his spirit only when he comes to the meeting, prays, or reads the Bible. This is because there is a demand for being spiritual in doing such things. The underlying reason many people are depressed and bound in the meetings is that they are confronted with spiritual demands. If there is no spiritual demand, there will not be any spiritual pressure. For example, if we physically jog up Kuling Mountain, we will not feel any spiritual pressure, because there is no spiritual demand. This does not mean that the meetings or prayers or reading the Scriptures make a person oppressed in his spirit. The person must be oppressed and bound in his spirit beforehand. When a spiritual demand comes, this oppression is accentuated, and the person becomes conscious of his spiritual depression. If a man is spiritually depressed, it shows that there is something fundamentally wrong with his spirit. When a man is walking or going about his secular business, he does not have any spiritual need and he does not feel any spiritual pressure. He experiences spiritual pressure only when he is faced with spiritual demands. This is what happens in the majority of cases.</p><p>Second, in a few cases there are exceptional reasons for spiritual oppression. Sometimes when most of the people are spiritually depressed in a meeting, the remaining ones can be affected by such depression. A few members may become spiritually oppressed because of a satanic attack or other supernatural frustrations. Their spiritual depression in the meeting can affect others. When a meeting is faced with this oppression, one individual is not enough to bring about a breakthrough; there is the need for concerted opposition. If one member in the meeting suffers the assault of oppressive forces within, those who are sensitive will sense death spreading in the environment.</p><p>With the first condition, there is the need of some fundamental dealings. If a man is under oppression for too long, he will treat this as a normal experience, and he will not know what liberty in the spirit means. With the second kind of pressure, the remedy is to exercise the spirit to throw off this oppression. Sometimes it takes three or five persons to break through in prayer. Those who are sensitive in their spirit can react to this opposition in two ways. They can recoil in their spirit, or they can push away this oppression with their spirit.</p><p>Brother Su: What does it mean to be enlightened?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Ephesians 5 is the only place in the Bible that defines light. According to that chapter, light is "everything that makes manifest" (v. 13). The word revelation in Greek is apokalupsis. Apo is to open, and kalupsis is a veil. Therefore, revelation simply means the removal of a veil. Light is related to revelation. To be enlightened means to receive a revelation. Once light comes, revelation comes. Revelation is determined by the amount of light received. God's revelation is what we receive through His light; it is the effect of this light in us. When light comes from God and reaches us, we have revelation. The end result of light is revelation.</p><p>Light of life is one of many kinds of light from God. It emanates from the Lord's life within us. When sin is present in the church, there is no speaking, no prophets, and no light. When the Lord shows us the light, however, we will have sight and revelation. Without revelation, we will not see anything. When God gathers His people together and speaks to them, this speaking constitutes light. When we see the light, we must fall down. It does not matter how we fall. We do not have to be that clear; there is no need to know whether we are falling forward, backward, to the left, or to the right. The sunlight finds us; we do not search for it with our lamp. Once a man sees light, he will have revelation, and that is all that counts. He will only need to praise; he will not need to plead for light. It is God's responsibility to give us the light. When we have a word from the Lord, we have light, and when light comes, we see, and that is all that counts. When we do not have light, we need light, and when light comes, we only need to open our eyes wide. Once we see the light, we just need to thank and praise Him; there is no further need to search for light.</p><p>As soon as light comes, revelation follows. Many times we suffer much because we try to search for the light. If a man does not fall before God in the face of light, but instead looks for more light, he will lose what little light he has. If a man does not obey the light that he has received from God, but insists on asking for more, he will lose the light he has received. Enlightening is God's concern, while revelation is the enlightenment we receive in our inner being.</p><p>Once light comes, it kills. Light is the greatest destroying factor. Once light comes, we fall and wilt; there is nothing we can hide under the light. Many harmful organisms in this world are killed by light. Under the light of the sun, everything is manifest. Confusion comes when we try to look for sunlight with a lamp. We have to set our eyes on the greater things, not be confined by the dimmer lights.</p><p>God's light is found in the Holy of Holies. Today the Holy of Holies is the church. Personal pursuits can easily lead to darkness. A man cannot get any light from analysis or mere supplication. He cannot find God through introspection. God's light is found only in the Holy of Holies. All is well when the church has prophets and divine speaking. When these things are present in the church, everyone will receive light from the church. It is disastrous when the church does not have any speaking. When a church has the divine speaking, it has light. We like to see men being exposed, being brought to light, and receiving revelation once they step into the church. Light comes from the ministry of the word, and the ministry of the word functions within the church. Light is found in the church, not in individuals. We have to receive light from God's word before we can serve others with this light.</p><p>Brother Chow: What is required in the ministry?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Our job is not just to be preachers, but to be apprentices. We must learn the lessons ourselves before we can lead others to the same way. Perhaps our capacity should be eighty pounds of weight, yet we can only carry one or two ounces. We have to receive much from the Lord before we can be constituted with the ministry. Unless we meet this demand what can we give to the Lord or to others? Peter said that we should not think that the fiery ordeal among us, coming to us for a trial, is anything strange (1 Pet. 4:12). We should not be surprised by any experience we encounter. The more trouble we encounter, the more we are equipped to serve. The more experience we have, the more we can meet the need. The trials that we suffer equip us for the ministry. We have to allow many troubles to come to us. We should refuse to pass on any message that is merely doctrine. We must speak what we have experienced. If a man rejects all the little dealings that come his way, he is disqualified from serving the Lord. We must learn the lessons ourselves before we can teach others. We must learn before we can give, before we can lead. A disciple means an apprentice. Christ's salvation is not a philosophy, doctrine, teaching, or ideal. What we speak must be what we have learned. Many people may think that this is too difficult. It is not too late for us to change our profession, but if we want to take this way, we have to learn the lessons. It is not enough to pick up doctrines, teachings, and dogmas. Doctrines are useless. We must go through many experiences ourselves. We can only be useful after we have been thoroughly dealt with by the Lord.</p><p>What then is required of the ministry? It requires that we learn and experience. The amount of ministry depends on the amount of experience we have. The standard of ministry is determined by the standard of our experience. This is the reason we have to be "violent"; we have to be willing to take the dealings, and we have to endeavor to pursue. If a man is entangled by small things, he will become useless. Therefore, we should never be mindful of small gains and losses. We have to develop a greater capacity, a greater view. The Lord has to deal with us in a thorough way before we can arrive at a rich ministry. We should not settle for a poor ministry; we should strive for a great ministry, a rich ministry.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: July 24, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE LIGHT</h2><p>Question: How can we be thorough in dealing with the ten or more lessons you have given concerning the character of the Lord's worker?</p><p>Answer: One basic lesson a worker has to learn is to use God's word effectively. Some people separate God's word from His light. To them, God's word is one thing and His light is another. They think that light will come after a minister of God's word opens his mouth, but this is precisely the reason their works are short of result. God's word can never be separated from His light. We should never allow our words to exceed our light. The amount of words and the amount of light should be the same. The general notion of most Christians is that they receive light from God's word. Yet in reality, light is merely something they hope to get; their own words still fill their mouth. This ministry produces paltry and shallow results. As ministers of God's word, we should not only release God's word when we speak, but also we should release His light spontaneously when we speak.</p><p>Ordinarily, light is found in lamps, but sunlight comes directly from the sun itself. There is no need for a lamp to contain the sunlight. In the same way, God's light does not require a lampstand; it shines directly. For the same reason, light should shine as soon as we open our mouth. There is no need to speak and then to wait for light to come. Consider the matter of preaching the gospel. Sometimes a preacher delivers a clear message, and then at the end says, "You should now pray, repent, and believe in the Savior." He is separating the preaching and the receiving into two different things. If the gospel is prevailing, however, a sinner does not need to wait to pray. He would be shaken and pricked in his heart, and he would have repented and believed as soon as he heard the gospel. There is no need to have a separate step of receiving. As soon as a sinner hears the word, he receives it. This was the case when Peter preached the gospel to the Jews. As soon as they heard the words of the gospel, they were convicted in their hearts, and they received instantly (Acts 2:37). In preaching various subjects, our word should be the very light; it should shine into man immediately. There is no need to package the light within the word. There is no need to carry the light within a lantern. Unless our words can impart light directly to others, our speaking as ministers of God's word will be a failure. It is a big failure if our words cannot directly transmit light to others. Something is very wrong if others have to search for the light.</p><p>When the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem, He was hungry and looking for fruit from a fig tree, but the tree only had leaves without fruit. The Lord then said to the tree, "May there no longer be fruit from you forever!" (Matt. 21:19). The tree instantly dried up. The very instant the Lord spoke, the thing was done. He told the tree, "Wither up!" and the tree dried up. Suppose we tell a little brother not to lie. If he goes home and prays, "Please, Lord, help me not to lie," we have only awakened him to himself with our wonderful words; there is still no light. The lie within him is still not burned away. When the Lord told the tree to dry up, it dried up immediately. There was no time for it to pray, "Lord, have mercy on me. In the future I will surely bear figs." The tree dried up in an instant. As ministers of God's word, we have to reach the same height. As soon as the word is released, there should be great light. Others should be subdued, and their problems should be burned away. The results should be instantaneous.</p><p>As soon as God's light shines, the sterilization is completed. We do not wait for the light to come and then experience the sterilization of the light. No, the light is the sterilization. If light is separated from sterilization, we will have to wait for months and years before we will be sterilized. Sterilization does not come after the shining; rather, the shining is the sterilization. When a minister of the word speaks, his word should carry light. A sinner should fall down before such a light, and a believer should fall and wilt before such a light. This is what it means to have the ministry of the word. As soon as the word is released, others should fall down on their faces. The instant Paul met the great light, he fell down (Acts 9:3-4). He did not wait for a long time. Our words should do the same thing.</p><h2 class="head2">In Order to Have Light, One Must First<br />Be a Person Who Has a Capacity for Light</h2><p>In order to give others light, we must first be those who have met the light. For this reason, we must not only learn to dispense light, but receive light. We must be like light-receptacles. As soon as God's light shines, we capture it; there is no need for any intermediary means. If we try to find the sun with a lantern, we will find the sun hiding behind the clouds. As soon as we meet the light, we should fall down. All we need to do is to let the light kill. Let it sterilize us. There is no need to seek help from other lights. Once light comes, our problems will go away. As soon as light shines, we become foolish. We will no longer be so "experienced" and polished. We will fall down. Light will confuse us. We may be wise at other times, but when light comes, we will become foolish. Those who are short of light will be very conscious of the shining when they receive some light, but those who are truly under a great shining will be thrown into total confusion. No one knows what will happen when light falls on him. God's word is like a sword. This sword is God's light. It is a two-edged sword. It lays all things naked and bare before it. After Paul saw the great light, he became confused. A man who has seen the great light is like a bucket whose bottom has fallen out of it; it is no longer able to hold any water of its own. Those who have seen great light are only too eager to confess their total inability. Light always humbles; it always confuses. One sister had been working for the Lord for over twenty years. One day God shined on her, and she began to wonder if she even was saved. Her experience with the light was actually a real salvation. This is how light comes, and this is the way.</p><p>When we touch the light on the negative side, the things that God disapproves of are burned away, but on the positive side we are spontaneously uplifted to a higher plane. It is easy for some people to receive the shining. With others it is hard. We must always position ourselves in such a way that we will easily receive the shining. Some people are aware of what is happening as soon as God touches them a little. Other people are in the dark even when God hits them with a hammer. Everyone who criticizes, who finds fault, or who is clogged up in his spirit will not easily find the shining. It is a serious thing to live before the Lord and to serve Him. If we want to be a minister of light yet cannot receive any shining, we have a big problem. A man who digs deep in life easily finds light, but a man who is shallow in life does not easily find light. When a minister of the word opens his mouth, we should receive some help. If we do not, it means that something is hardened within us. If we are a person who is inwardly open, we receive help even when we listen to the gospel. If any man thinks that he understands everything, he probably only has mental knowledge. In reality he is far from knowing anything. If we are proper persons and we sit in a place where the gospel is preached properly, surely we will be impressed. This is what happens when a man's spirit is open. Some people have a spirit that is harder than a wall. It is hard for them to see any light or to receive any shining. One little leaf can block off the view of a whole star. We have to stand in the right position, and we have to have the right attitude. If our attitude is wrong, the light will be blocked from us. We have to learn to be a man of light, receiving and taking in light.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT,<br />THE OUTER MAN MUST BE BROKEN</h2><p>Question: How can we exercise our spirit?</p><p>Answer: In order to exercise the spirit, the outer man must be broken. Otherwise we will be like a coalition government with different parties vying within a legislature. Before a law can be passed, it has to fight through layers of opposition and compromise. If the inner man is mixed up with the outer man, it will be difficult to exercise our spirit. In order to push out our spirit in a strong way, we have to learn to deal with the outer man. If the outer man, that is, the mind, emotion, and will, are mixed up with the inner man, we cannot exercise our spirit. If a minister of God's word cannot use his spirit, it is because his mind, emotion, and will are all mixed up with his spirit. Our spirit must be pure. Otherwise it may be like a flask of ointment that is spoiled by one fly. Those who are not pure in their spirit cannot exercise their spirit. How can our spirit be pure? The inner man can only be pure when the outer man is broken.</p><p>Anything that is contaminated, anything that is corrupted, is impure. If a man has an impure spirit, his speaking will close up the spirit of those who have been taught by God. Even if he carefully disguises himself and shuts up his mouth, his pretension will still expose him to those who have been taught by God. As soon as a man speaks, his spirit is exposed. He cannot hide; the kind of person he is will always come out. This is the reason our outer man must be broken. As soon as our outer man is broken, the contamination will be gone, and the impure elements will disappear. The outer man must be broken. A worker must open his eyes wide; he must observe everything before he can render others proper help. The outer man must be totally crushed before the inner spirit can be released. We are not here to improve and mend the outer man. The outer man is useless no matter how we look at it. The only way is for it to be broken.</p><p>We have to be genuine. You have been holding a tight rein on yourself. You need to relax. Soberness that comes as a result of holding a tight rein on oneself is not true soberness. Once tiredness and weariness set in, the true self will be exposed. Those who have passed through severe chastisements will display a more genuine kind of soberness. Those who are lame by birth do not have to pretend that they are lame; the awkwardness in their legs reminds them of this fact. Those who pretend to be lame forget this "lameness" as soon as they must fight to get on a bus. A person who has just been rebuked by his father will shut up without the need of much conscious reminding. He is careful, but he is not tense. He is cautious in a very spontaneous way. There is a difference between artificial tension and tension that arises out of chastisement. Artificial tension is a kind of pretension, while the tension that arises out of chastisement is genuine. If we are indeed chastised, we should live under the influence of such chastisement. In order to serve the Lord effectively, the outer man must be dealt with. Otherwise, he will remain proud and hard. This is a very basic problem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF REVELATION</h2><p>Question: What is revelation?</p><p>Answer: Concerning this point, we have to see three examples in the New Testament. In Matthew 16 Peter received revelation from the Father in heaven to see the person and work of Christ. In Galatians 1 Paul received revelation to see the truth of the gospel and the inward unveiling of God's Son. In Revelation 1 John received revelation of Jesus Christ. Revelation is basically precipitated by God's special moves. A man may be an eloquent speaker, but he does not necessarily have revelation. Revelation results from God's move. God has to move to reveal Himself to us. Genuine revelation always hinges on God's move. All revelations are special moves of God. What we hear in a sermon is not revelation. Revelation is not an ordinary move; it is a special move. If God does not move in a special way, we will not have any genuine revelation even if we say that we have seen something. There is revelation only as God moves in a special way and our spirit sees something. Hence, revelation is a very definite move of God. One can say that he "sees" something in a general sense, but he cannot say that he has received a revelation in that sense. Revelation is something much more profound. The revelation spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14:26 refers to what God opens up to a person specifically at that very instant. Those who prophesy speak on what they see and know all along, but when someone beside him receives a "revelation," that is, when he receives something specific from God at that instant, the one who is prophesying should be quiet and allow the one who has received a revelation to speak (vv. 29-30).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: July 26, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN LISTENING TO OTHERS</h2><p>Question: What are the particular things we have to know concerning listening to others?</p><p>Answer: Whether or not we can listen to others depends mainly on our objectivity. Only those who are objective can "translate," rather than "interpret," what they hear. In order to be objective, the self has to be dealt with. Once the self is dealt with, we become objective. Only an objective person can listen to others. Once a man becomes subjective in his attitude, he is useless in the work of God. A subjective person cannot listen to what others have to say, much less listen to what God has to say. The basic requirement for listening to others is to be objective. A lazy person is useless in the hand of God. So is a subjective person.</p><p>The same basic requirement holds true in understanding God's word&mdash;one must not be subjective. The kind of person we are will determine the kind of "word" we get. Once a man becomes subjective, he will read his own thoughts into God's word. Only an objective person will find God's will in His word.</p><p>No subjective person will truly understand others' feelings. Suppose three or five persons with a similar frame of mind are together. If a subjective person joins them, he may indulge in a self-centered discourse to the neglect of the others' feelings. Such a person lives in the realm of his own feelings. He cannot touch others' feelings. An objective person, however, would first touch others' feelings; he would easily blend in with their feelings and be one with their spirit. A subjective person can never catch up with others' spirit or enter others' feelings. He cannot touch God's word, because he cares only for his own feeling. He is insensitive to the feeling of the Holy Spirit. A subjective person only cares about himself. He wants to subject others' feelings to his own. Problems arise when a subjective person takes control, because others' feelings are always trampled.</p><p>The main reason for subjectivity is an unbroken self. All subjective persons are audacious, and all of them are short of spiritual knowledge before God. A subjective person only sees himself. He does not know how high the sky is or how great the earth is. A subjective person must be thoroughly broken.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN JUDGMENT</h2><p>It is not easy for a worker of the Lord to make judgments. We have to pray and consider much before we can make a small decision. If a man can make a decision within five minutes, it means that he is a very subjective person. In order to deal with a situation, we have to build up some history behind us. Otherwise, we cannot deal with it. For example, the disciples once asked the Lord the reason they could not cast out a demon. The Lord answered that the kind of demon in question could only be cast out through fasting and prayer (Matt. 17:19, 21). Yet the Lord cast out the demon immediately, indicating that the Lord Himself was well prepared. This is a basic requirement for working for the Lord. Many brothers and sisters are too bold. There is a saying that a foolish man will dare to go where angels fear to tread. When a man places himself under God's mighty hand and remains in submission, not speaking or acting rashly, and not trying to be a teacher to many, he will carry out God's will and be qualified to make judgments.</p><p>Subjectivity should be condemned. All divisions arise out of human subjectivity. A subjective person cannot obey others. Before the Lord, it is not easy to make judgments concerning many things. Yet many young brothers come to some kind of judgment within five minutes without having prayed about it at all. (Or perhaps they do not know how to pray in the first place.) They are too bold. They are bold because they are foolish. It is impossible to tell such a person to fear God or to submit to others.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE FOR THE BUILDING UP</h2><p>Once a person refuses to take his proper position, there will be confusion in the church. In order for the church to be built up, everyone has to practice submission. There must be stones on top of other stones before there can be the temple. If no stone is on top of another stone, we only have desolation. A subjective person cannot submit to others and, hence, cannot be built up with others. He cannot coordinate with anyone. Many problems arise from some sisters. They think they can teach the Bible and make judgments, and they bring much havoc to the church. A proud and blind person probably will never submit to anyone in his lifetime. It is easy for a person to submit to the Lord, but not at all easy to submit to men. Suppose I ask Brother Paul to pray for me concerning something. In my prayer I may feel to do something, but Paul may receive the light through his prayer that this should not be done. I should yield to the leading of my elder brother Paul. This is the principle of the church. If all the brothers and sisters say that you should not do a certain thing, yet you insist on doing it, you are taking the way of the Gentiles; you are not a person living in the church. You cannot say that you are always right. You have to listen to those who have gone through more training and submit to them. Madame Guyon maintained a deep fellowship with God, yet she subjected herself to the authority of La Combe. This is the reason we have her autobiography today, and this is the reason the church has received so much supply from her in subsequent generations. She did not want to write the autobiography herself, but at the insistence of La Combe, she consented.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LEADING AND SUPPLY OF THE BODY</h2><p>All leadings should pass the test of Body fellowship. Every leading of the Body comes to us through other members. Human subjectivity can become a great obstacle. As soon as a man becomes subjective, he will not be able to receive leadings from other members. We have to learn to submit to the church and to go along with others' opinions. Thinking that we are always right is extreme arrogance. The supply of the Body and the leading of the Body often are one and the same thing. Timothy often acted according to Paul's leading, and he was in reality carrying out Paul's work. As a result, the blessing of Paul went to Timothy. If a young person will not submit to the older brothers and sisters in the church, he is giving up the source of his own supply. The blessing of the older ones will not reach him. Young brothers and sisters should always take the word of the older ones; they should always obey them. The older ones have become what they are today through many years of pursuit. Once we submit to them and receive from them, we gain all that they have gained. If we have learned the lesson of obedience, we can turn one Paul into ten thousand Pauls, because everyone will inherit all the riches of his forebears.</p><p>The confusion of Protestantism arises from extreme individualism. If we know the church, we will receive supply from the ministers. Once we receive the supply of the members, we will become rich because as soon as we receive from others, what they have will become ours. In the body when the eyes see, the hands see. If we are a hand, and we receive the seeing of the eyes, we get the light. But if we will not accept the seeing of the eyes, we are left in the dark. Coordination in the Body brings in riches. If we all take our position in the Body, the attainments of all the members will be ours. If a man is ignorant of the supply of the church, he is a poor man, and his spiritual life will gradually wilt away. A subjective person will only trust in himself. A man may be a new believer, but he will become very rich as long as he takes what the older ones have seen and does not insist on seeing the same things himself.</p><p>The church is not mainly for authority but for supply. If we all take the way of church fellowship, the churches in the whole world will have a great change. If a man will receive others' riches, what riches he will experience, and what riches he will impart to the church! May we all be poor voluntarily so that we can receive others' riches and see what they see. If a man sees the principle of Body fellowship, everything under the direction of the Head will meet the need of the whole Body. There is no need to distinguish too clearly between the Head and the Body. The supply of the Head is the supply of the Body. In 1 Corinthians 12, we do not see a distinction between the Head and the Body (vv. 12, 21). The Head is the Body, and the Body is the Head; there is no separation between the two.</p><p>We have to learn to know the oneness of the Body. The more the church lives in the reality of the spirit, the richer it becomes. It is a smart thing for the young ones to take the supply and leading from the older ones while they are still young. If they insist on personally going through the leadings the older ones have gone through, it may be a very long time before they accumulate these same riches. Even if they receive something, they cannot be certain that what they have received is reliable. The Catholic way of conformity is wrong, but the Protestant way of independent freedom is also wrong. Anyone can read the Bible, but not everyone can expound the Bible. The work of the latter belongs to the ministers. If we receive the supply from the ministers, we will become very rich indeed. We must all learn to be delivered from subjectivity so that we can become rich.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 19, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><p>Question: What is the reminding of the Holy Spirit?</p><p>Answer: We can only remember what we have encountered. Remembering means thinking of something a second time. The reminding of the Holy Spirit is when the Holy Spirit reveals to us a second time what we have seen. Every time the Holy Spirit reveals something to us, He presents a picture before us. The reminding of the Holy Spirit unveils this picture before us a second time. It reminds us not only of words spoken, but it gives us a revisitation, a fresh revelation of what we once saw.</p><p>The reminding of the Holy Spirit preserves the freshness of past revelations. For example, there are two ways to remember the Lord at His table. One is through personal revelation, and the other is through the reminding of the Holy Spirit. In the first case, a man realizes that the Lord is the Savior. In the second case, a man sees the very picture of the Lord's salvation. When we break the bread, we must not only recognize the Lord as the Savior, but also we must have a fresh vision of the picture of His salvation. This kind of bread-breaking will give us a strong and powerful impression. The same can be said of the ministry of the word. There must be a seeing and a revelation, but there must also be a renewed revelation at the time the word is actually delivered. Only then can the speaking be powerful. This is what we mean by the reminding of the Holy Spirit. Those who are in the ministry of the word must not only remember the words of a revelation, but the very picture of the revelation. Unless we can do this, we cannot be ministers of the word. Without the reminding of the Holy Spirit, a man's past revelations are dead; they remain revelations that belong to one individual. Worse still, they are revelations that seemingly belong to someone else. Without the memory of the Holy Spirit, any revelation can merely be seen as the revelation of the Bible. These revelations belong to the past. It is useless to repeat these revelations without the reminding of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit must shine upon these revelations once again before they can become living. Paul first spoke about justification by faith, but Martin Luther had to see the very same thing&mdash;justification by faith&mdash;before he could speak. The same holds true for our own revelations&mdash;we must see it once again before we can speak it and before it will produce any effect in others. We have to see the same revelations which we once saw. This is the meaning of the reminding of the Holy Spirit, and this equips us for proper service.</p><p>Question: What is the meaning of the words revelation, knowledge, prophecy, and teaching in 1 Corinthians 14:6?</p><p>Answer: Prophecy is the speaking of the prophets. Teaching is based on the speaking of the prophets. Revelation is the shining and enlightening which one receives from the Holy Spirit. Knowledge is what one has learned from God. The first two kinds&mdash;revelation and knowledge&mdash;are inward and hidden. The other two kinds&mdash;prophecy and teaching&mdash;are outward and open. Prophecy and teaching are communicative. Of course, revelation and knowledge are communicative as well. The relationship between revelation and knowledge is similar to the relationship between prophecy and teaching. The places revelation and knowledge hold with respect to each other are the same as the places prophecy and teaching hold with respect to each other. Revelation is what a man sees inwardly under the light. Knowledge is the deposit that comes as a result of the revelation. When God shines on man, he receives a revelation. After he sees the revelation, something remains in him, which is knowledge. These are inward activities. Only those who have received revelation can prophesy, and only those who have knowledge can teach. Revelation resides within an individual. It is useful only to him; this revelation is useless to the church. A revelation only becomes useful when it is communicated to others. This communication is prophecy. In the same way, knowledge resides in a man alone; it is useless to the church. It must also be communicated to others before it can become useful. This communication of knowledge is teaching. The basis of prophecy is revelation, while the basis of teaching is knowledge. If teaching remains a teaching, without having knowledge, which is the effect of revelation, as its basis, this teaching will become a problem. God gives man revelation. When a man speaks according to the instant revelation, he has a prophecy. When he speaks according to past revelation, he has a teaching. The deposit of past revelations in a person is knowledge. The present speaking of past revelations is prophecy, while the present speaking of past knowledge is teaching. Revelation brings in prophecy, while knowledge brings in teaching.</p><p>Question: What is the place of human memory?</p><p>Answer: There is a place for our own memory, but the most important thing in our ministry of the word is not to interrupt our spirit with the activity of our memory. In fulfilling the ministry of the word, we should direct all our attention and energy to the spirit. We have to fully exercise our spirit. There must not be any distraction to frustrate the spirit. This is the only way for the spirit to be released. The spirit is very sensitive; once it is frustrated, it is bound. At times we need the help of the memory, but we must never frustrate the spirit when we are exercising our memory.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 20, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH IDLE TALK</h2><p>Question: In the course of our work, what should we do when we encounter idle talk?</p><p>Answer: One basic training a worker of the Lord must go through is to ignore idle talk. Those who like to listen to idle talk or who are keen to hunt for idle talk are not qualified for God's work or for the ministry. Their mind and mental energy are wasted on inconsequential things. It is no surprise that they are not able to focus themselves on their ministry. Listening to idle talk is one of the worst habits in the work of God.</p><p>Ephesians was written by Paul, a servant of God. It is absolutely God's word, and its revelation is very high indeed. Paul could be so free, uninhibited, and released in that Epistle because God's word was so heartily received in the church in Ephesus. In contrast with the book of Ephesians, we have the Epistles to the Corinthians. They were written by Paul also, and they are also God's word. Yet they do not reach the same height as the book of Ephesians. This is because Paul had to deal with so many low things in the church in Corinth. This shows that when we pay attention to the low things, God cannot show us the high things. Therefore, we have to set our eyes on the high and great things. When our spirit and words are released, they will be high and great.</p><p>The spirit discerns all things and knows all things. If we are new to a local church, we may not know anything about the place. Yet our spirit can still sense the condition in that place. We have to serve by our spirit. The spirit has to be the organ with which we contact others. We must not merely exercise our ears to listen to others or to deal with people and events. Those whose ears are too open are surely loose and careless. Those whose mouth is too open are surely unbridled in their tongue. It is, of course, different when God wants to direct our ears to hear something. We have to learn from the pattern of the Lord Jesus, who was a "blind" and "deaf" servant (Isa. 42:19). The most important thing a minister of the word has to remember is to not seek out gossip or encourage idle talk. He should instead cultivate his spirit and serve by his spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT<br />AND THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>Question: How can we exercise our spirit?</p><p>Answer: In exercising our spirit, we have to realize that the basic requirement is first to break down the outer man. This is the only way the spirit within can be released. Our need is to be torn down in a fundamental way, to be weakened, and to be broken in the outer man. If our mind, emotion, and will are not broken, they will be released before the spirit is given the chance to be released, and we will never be able to exercise our spirit. Our spirit must be stronger than everything else. It has to become the strongest part of our being. Only after it has become the strongest part of our being will our mind, emotion, and will become useful. For example, some brothers are very eloquent, but they are not broken. When they speak, only their eloquence comes out; their spirit does not have a chance to be released.</p><p>Why does God not break the mind or emotion of some people? The answer involves the matter of proportion. God breaks and deals with the conspicuous parts that come out of a person first. If the part that comes out first is the emotion, God will deal with the emotion. If the part that comes out first is the mind, He will break the mind. He breaks and deals with the parts that come out first. After He has done this, the spirit gains the preeminence. If a man has a very strong spirit, and his emotion is behind his spirit, this emotion can be useful. If a man does not have a strong spirit, however, and his emotion is ahead of it, he will be in trouble; he will not be able to use his spirit.</p><p>If a man is not broken, it is easy for his outer man to clash with others. If his outer man is broken, it will be easy for him to be one with others in spirit, and spontaneously this will eliminate any conflict. Once a man manifests a strong spot in any area, his spirit is hampered. Therefore, strong spots must be broken before a man can release his spirit. If we cannot release our spirit, we cannot serve. This is the reason we do not admire the gifted or eloquent ones. Rather, we admire those who are in God's hand, who have passed through His chastisement, and who bear the mark of the cross. Only they give prominence to their spirit when they function, and only they are useful in the eyes of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL AND SPIRIT AND<br />THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between the sense of the spirit and the feelings of the soul?</p><p>Answer: The more one tries to distinguish the sense of the spirit and the feelings of the soul, the more confused he becomes. Only an experienced person can differentiate the spirit from the soul. It is God's business to divide our spirit from our soul. Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow." As God performs a special work of breaking and tearing down our outer man, we will be clear about the dividing of our soul from our spirit. We all have strong spots. Once these strong spots are crushed, our spirit will come out, and our soul will be put to use. When the outer man is broken, the inner man will be released.</p><p>Our outer man is a shell; it exists on this earth for the purpose of interacting with outward circumstances. The inner man is our true self. Those whose spirit is divided from their soul have a great gulf separating the outer man from the inner man. Those whose spirit and soul are separated can be very busy in the outer man, but their inner man is untouched. It is not affected by the outside world, and it remains in God. For example, one brother had a very tragic experience. Yet under God's special mercy, he remained calm and peaceful inside in spite of the outward pains. God set the peace as a gulf, a separating wall, between him and his outer man.</p><p>It is God's great mercy to break down our outer man. The breaking enables us to always abide in the inner man. When the outer man is broken, the inner man seems to have moved its home. It is no longer affected by the outer man. The inner man belongs to us; it is deep, and it is spiritual. The outer man is shallow; it is of the flesh. If the outer man is not broken, we will never be able to tell the difference between the outer man and the inner man.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN VIRTUE AND WORLDLY ASCETICISM</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between Christian virtue and worldly asceticism?</p><p>Answer: A proper Christian will convey a sense of God to others. He will incite others to worship and glorify God, but those who cultivate themselves merely build up themselves. They only give others a taste of man, and they draw praises to man. The more they practice asceticism, the stronger their self becomes. In fact, the more "virtuous" a person is, the more he gives others the feeling that he is above them. The more a Christian is broken, the less others will be conscious of him, and the humbler he becomes. Others will only touch God in him. The more a worldly person practices self-denial, the greater his self becomes. We find this particularly prevalent in India. Indian philosophy far excels the ethics of most ordinary men and women. Yet no one touches God through this philosophy. A Christian who takes up the cross, however, whether he is a Chinese, a Japanese, or an Englishman, gives others the impression of God. They cause others to worship God and to glorify Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT<br />AND FREEDOM FROM SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS</h2><p>Question: What does it mean to release the spirit, and what does it mean to be free from self-consciousness?</p><p>Answer: When we speak for God, our spirit rises up. Every time we speak, our spirit rises up a little. When our spirit rises up during our speaking, we have to consciously release this spirit. As our speaking becomes more and more weighty, we will learn that a frivolous spirit cannot carry the weight of our word. We have to release the word with a sober spirit. We have to exercise our will to stir up our spirit to release the word. Therefore, our spirit as well as our feelings must be in line with God's word. We need to accept God's breaking under the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that our outer man can be dealt with and we can be purified daily. Then our spirit will be free and available. There is the need of a fundamental breaking work. Only then will our spirit be free to be released. Otherwise, our soul will come out instead.</p><p>Those who are free from self-consciousness can be considered "naturally spiritual." Self-consciousness is a function of the soul. Those who are strong in self- consciousness are strong in their soul. Those who do not have self-consciousness can use their spirit more freely. For this reason, it is easier for God to use those who are free from self-consciousness. The absence of such consciousness is a basic qualification for preaching the gospel.</p><p>Whether or not our meeting will be strong depends on whether a minister of the word pours out his all on his audience. He must stake all his feelings and thoughts on his spirit and push such a spirit out. The more a minister of the word sacrifices, the more focused and powerful his word becomes. If he sacrifices little, his words will be diluted, and there will be little power to them.</p><h2 class="head1">A BASIC REVELATION</h2><p>Question: What is a basic revelation?</p><p>Answer: Peter received a knowledge of the Lord when he was in the region of Caesarea Philippi, but he received a knowledge of himself in the courtyard of Pontius Pilate. In his case, knowledge of the Lord and knowledge of the self were two separate matters. Paul saw a great light on the way to Damascus; it flashed all around him, and he fell to the ground. When he fell, he knew the Lord and himself at the same time. This is the proper and standard way to be saved. We should receive our basic revelation in the same way that Paul received his; we should know the Lord in an instant and know ourselves thoroughly at the same time. This is the standard experience of salvation. Unfortunately, gospel preachers today do not render people enough light, and men do not have enough knowledge about themselves or about the Lord. We are speaking many things which can only be considered as make-up lessons for the gospel. In one sense we can even say that we are still preaching the gospel now.</p><p>Many spiritual things should have come to us at the time salvation came to us, but because of a shortage of light, we have wasted much time. The only thing that requires time is the growth in life. Other things such as consecration can be experienced at the same time that a person is saved. However, due to the shortage of light, some have not consecrated themselves even ten years after being saved. Nothing can bring in more confusion to one's salvation than the shortage of strong light and adequate revelation. Some experience grace ten times, even a hundred times, but the total effect of these experiences is less than the one time Paul experienced the grace of knowing the Lord and himself at the time of his conversion. What we are doing here today can only be considered a kind of make-up lesson. In his Epistles Paul tells us of the riches the Lord has given us. He tells us about everything that the Lord has given us. What we have received today comes far short of what Paul speaks about. The Lord has given us everything. From the time of the apostles, the church has been busy with make-up lessons. It has dropped many things that the Lord has given it. The Lord has done everything for us. Today when we speak of revelation, we are merely speaking of seeing what the Lord has accomplished for us already. We need a basic revelation because we were short in the past; we received less than a quarter of the total revelation. Today under God's light, we want to receive all four quarters. This is what we mean by receiving basic revelation. Some are saved one hundred percent. Others are saved ten percent. What we are doing today is recovering fully and completely what the Lord has given us already.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 21, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF WISDOM AND A WORD OF KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>Question: What is the meaning of the terms "a word of wisdom" and "a word of knowledge" in 1 Corinthians 12:8?</p><p>Answer: First Corinthians 12:8 says, "For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit." Words of knowledge are words given by the Holy Spirit to relate facts. Words of wisdom are words given by the Holy Spirit to explain the reasons. Words of knowledge involve "what," and words of wisdom involve "why."</p><h2 class="head1">DEFILEMENT OF FLESH AND OF SPIRIT</h2><p>Question: What is the defilement of flesh and the defilement of spirit in 2 Corinthians 7:1?</p><p>Answer: The defilement of flesh is a defilement that originates from the flesh. In this defilement the flesh takes an active role. Defilement of spirit is an outside defilement that invades the spirit. In this defilement the spirit takes a passive role; it is acted upon. Once the flesh is defiled, the spirit is contaminated, defiled, and cannot rise up.</p><p>Question: What is the proper way to exercise supernatural power?</p><p>Answer: If supernatural power matches the operation of our spirit within, this power can be of use to us, and it is reliable. If it does not match our spirit, we cannot use it.</p><h2 class="head1">GIFT, MINISTRY, AND OPERATION</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between gift, ministry, and operation?</p><p>Answer: Gifts are what the Holy Spirit Himself imparts to man. They are not something that a man possesses in himself, and they are objective in nature. The Holy Spirit puts these gifts directly in man. When a man receives a gift, he is empowered to serve. Ministry is subjective. Every saved person has a ministry assigned by the Lord. Gifts are for the fulfillment of the ministry. We fulfill our ministry by the gifts given by the Holy Spirit. A gift is unrelated to the person receiving it; it is objective, having been placed directly in man by the Spirit. When a man serves the Lord according to this gift, he has a ministry. Here is a problem: Some people have gifts, but they do not necessarily use them in the way of a ministry. When a man's exercise of his gift is not under the Lord's authority, his gift is not being employed in the way of ministry because ministry always subjects itself to the Lord's authority. The Corinthians had gifts, but they did not have any ministry because they did not come under the Lord's authority. A man must first subject himself to the Lord's authority before he can exercise his gift to fulfill his ministry. Under the right conditions, a gift fulfills a ministry, and the ministry becomes part of God's work. This is what operation is; it is simply part of God's work.</p><h2 class="head1">INSTANT UTTERANCE</h2><p>Question: Can we rely on instant utterance?</p><p>Answer: If a man has learned his lessons before the Lord, his instant utterance will be a residual deposit of the light he receives from the Holy Spirit. Those who are trained by the Lord can turn the residual light they receive from the Holy Spirit into knowledge and make it a teaching. If a man has not learned his lessons from God, the instant words that he receives are probably products of his own mind. They are probably something from his brain or some arguments concerning the Scripture. Such words will not render others any supply or benefit.</p><p>Whether or not a church is strong depends on the ministry of the word. The whole burden rests on the ministers. If the ministers are poor and do not minister God's word, the church will be poor. In the church in Corinth we only find the gift of tongues. Therefore, there was only the ministry of tongues. Paul prophesied according to revelation. He had the word of prophecy. He also taught according to the knowledge derived from this revelation. This is what God wants to see in the church. The speaking in the church must at least be teachings based on knowledge, which is derived from revelation. A better kind of speaking is that which is based on the reminding of the Holy Spirit. This speaking will bring light to the church.</p><p>The ministry of the word that we are referring to here is absolutely subjective. We have to speak God's past words, and we have to speak God's present words. In delivering our words we have to be strong, and our utterance has to be rich. As we deliver the words sentence by sentence, we have to make them the outflow of life. The more we speak, the lighter our inward burden should become. The result should be a kind of unloading and relief. How God judges our ministry and whether or not it will touch others is something beyond our control; this is objective. The important thing for us to know is the kind of person we are and whether or not we have received a revelation. This is very subjective to us. We have to be inwardly clear concerning the way we take. We have to learn our lessons before God. We have to start with ourselves. If we accept the dealings and learn our lessons, these dealings and lessons will become part of our ministry. If, however, we have not learned anything ourselves, we only will have empty truths. Until we deal with this issue, we cannot face other problems.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING BEING CLOSED</h2><h2 class="head2">God Closing What He Has Given</h2><p>Question: Can you say something about being closed?</p><p>Answer: There are two ways of being closed. The first is the closing of the heart. The second relates to God closing what He has given. Let us cover the second kind first, which involves God closing what He has given to man. When God chooses a man to be a minister, and his revelation reaches a certain height, he will become the ministry of the word in that age. If this person becomes proud and begins to interpret God's word by himself, God will seal him up, and he will not see any more light. In every age God chooses great vessels to meet His own need. These vessels have learned many lessons and have gone through many dealings. As a result they see what no one else in that generation has seen. In a certain age God may choose five brothers to see what others in the same age have not seen. They see a kind of extraordinary revelation. But it is possible that God will close some of them up after they have received this extraordinary revelation. A man who has received great revelation will not receive further revelation if he assumes lordship by himself, dictating and dissecting God's word at will. He may still speak and teach, but he will not receive new light. God will be closed to him. This is a most solemn thing.</p><p>Everyone who knows and fears God will not dare treat His word lightly. However, some do not fear and tremble at God's word; they make rash judgments about God's word, cutting it nonchalantly. God will close up such people. He is gracious, and He may not close up these ones immediately. Although some people are rebellious, God still grants them limited grace and small blessings. Yet in their ignorance, these ones become proud because of the little grace and blessing they have received. They are foolish. In the heat of man's rebellion, God may not remove all grace immediately. But when a man offends the Holy Spirit to a certain extent, He will seal off such a man. He will not be able to rise up again, and he will not receive any more revelation. We often offend God, but He deals with us slowly. He does not deal with us immediately according to our sin. The more God treats us this way, the more we have to be careful. Neither the presence of blessings nor the presence of grace and fruit guarantee that we are on the right track. We can never know when God will close us up. It may happen this time, or it may happen the next time. God is the One who closes up men as a result of their offenses. He does not specify how many times He will tolerate us; it may be three times or it may be five times. Sometimes God deals with us quickly. At other times He deals with us slowly. We have to be careful in dealing with God's word. We must not make any decision according to our own will. Many people are deceived by blessings before their eyes. They do not realize that such blessings are merely a sign of God's toleration. We have to know that God's toleration is not His permission nor is it His will.</p><p>We have to be in much fear and trembling because we do not know when God will seal up a man. Only a foolish man will say that it matters little whether he once rebelled or whether he is still rebelling. We must bear in mind that many have fallen by the wayside and are sealed up just because they treated God's word with contempt. If a man becomes very rebellious, God may even keep from him what He generally shows to His children in that generation. He will not see anything. He will be closed up. Such a one will not see any high revelation, and he will not see any ordinary revelation. When a man is ignorant of God and thinks that it is all right to rebel, he will become arrogant. This is a pity. Many people continually rebel. They do not know when God moves His hand and when the sealing comes. This is very risky. The greatest punishment that God can mete out to man is to allow him to remain in his errors. The highest punishment is being left by God in darkness.</p><p>If we are ministers of God, it means that we are trustees of God's light. We have to preserve the value of the light. We cannot allow it to be devalued. If we have fulfilled our ministry and others do not see anything, that is their loss. If they accept the light, they are not doing us a favor; they are doing themselves a favor. If others see light through our ministry, we should not rejoice over ourselves; we should rejoice for them. Whoever receives light receives blessing, and whoever rejects light incurs loss. If anyone receives light from us, we should not rejoice over ourselves; we should only rejoice for them. Whenever a minister of the word finds God sealing someone up, he should be in fear and trembling lest he himself be sealed up as well. Nothing is more pitiful than to be sealed up by God. The threat of sin can never match the threat of darkness. Some people simply cannot see anything. Their minds are simply warped. No matter how much we speak to them, they will not turn and they will not see. I am not afraid of sinners, but I am afraid of sinners who dwell in darkness. Once a man is sealed up, he will never see light again. This is what happens to some. They are closed up, and they never see, hear, or have any understanding in their heart again. We have to be in fear and trembling. We must fear God and maintain this fear within us.</p><p>All who walk in darkness think that they are in the light. This is a basic problem with them. If our condition is right, we will receive light continually. A man can strive about anything, but he can never strive about his ministry. Those who have the ministry need not worry about opposition. Where revelation is, there is God's chosen testimony. Others can say all they want, and they can oppose all they want. However, where revelation lies, light is found, and God's mark is present. Heaven will be open to us, and this will become our strength and the authority of our commission. Once we see revelation, we should be satisfied. It is the heavenly vision that sustains us. God's pleasure resides in the places that the doors of heaven have opened. Those who have the ministry may suffer hardship, but as long as they have light, they have authority.</p><h2 class="head2">The Closing of the Heart</h2><p>The other kind of closing is related to the heart. In Matthew 13:15 the Lord said, "For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them." The Lord was speaking in parables in Matthew 13 because God cannot reveal Himself to the wise and intelligent. The wise and intelligent spoken of in Matthew 11:25 had their hearts sealed up by God; they could not expect to see any revelation from Him. God's revelation was closed to them because they were too proud. The more childlike a person is, the more willing he is to receive help from the Lord, and the more his spirit will be open to God. Such a person will receive much revelation. The more a person considers himself wise and intelligent, and the more arrogant and self-assured he is, the more God will close him up. God will give to him a slumbering heart. His eyes will not see, nor will his ears hear (Rom. 11:8). For God to give a man a slumbering heart means for Him to seal off his heart; he will no longer see any revelation. This is a serious matter. We have to ask the Lord to preserve our heart and spirit in meekness and humility. If we do this, we will continue to see light.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 23, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">SIX WAYS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>God presents the gospel to man in different ways. In preaching the gospel we have to follow these ways to present the good news to men effectively. Throughout church history many evangelists raised up by God have gained sinners through these ways. Here we would like to analyze these different ways of preaching the gospel. The Bible unveils these ways, and God's evangelists have used them again and again in the past. Broadly speaking, there are six ways to preach the gospel. Today we will take a look at these six ways. Those who have had experience in preaching the gospel, as well as those who are about to launch into this work, should pray to God to show them one of these ways. The way you choose should match the kind of person you are. Generally speaking, everyone should choose one way. He may choose more than one way, but he should major in one of them, while treating the others as supplementary ways. Of course, when one moves to a new place, he may take a different way based on the situation of that place. These six ways of preaching the gospel can be classified under two categories. The first is negative, and the second is positive. Three ways are found in the negative category, and the other three ways found in the positive category. On the negative side there are sin, judgment, and the world. On the positive side there are God's love, God's righteousness, and a living faith. Let us first speak about the three negative ways.</p><h2 class="head2">Sin</h2><p>Some put emphasis on the evil and ill of sin. The Bible shows us that sin is both loathsome and evil. Many servants of God often use this way to preach the gospel. An evangelist may use this method to point out the evil of sin, and sinners may feel the sinfulness of sin and be condemned and convicted. The basic goal of this method is to awaken men to a consciousness of their sin. Those who use this method have to do it with skill; they have to be enlightened concerning the matter of sin. A gospel preacher has to have his own style; he has to develop his own specialty. If you take this way, you have to apply yourself to it. You must make others feel that they are sinful. You have to convict them with a sense of sin. You have to show them that sin is filthy. Let them feel the pressure and burden of sin. You should not only talk about sin as a term, but you must let them feel the pain of sin, the repulsiveness of sin. Taking this way requires one skill: You must let people feel sin. There is no need to do too many things. As long as you can make people weep when they think of their sin, the gospel will get into them, and you will have done your job.</p><p>In order to take this way, you must concentrate on convicting men of their own sins. If you choose this way, you must spend time before the Lord. You should ask the Lord to show you how to awaken men to a sense of sin. Of course, you must first have experienced the pain of sin. You must first have confessed your sins before others can pick up a profound sense of sin. If you want to take this way, you must apply yourself to this subject, whether in private meditation, in the study of the Scripture, in listening to sermons, or in research for stories and illustrations. In everything you should ask yourself how you can increase men's sense of condemnation concerning sin. You should take this task to heart. If you do, you will be able to present the evil and ill of sin to men in your preaching in a vivid way. When they see sin, they will be able to know the Lord's salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Judgment</h2><p>After man sinned, he was sentenced to death by God. The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). However, death is not the end of man; after death there is judgment (Heb. 9:27)! An unbeliever will suffer judgment after he dies. The punishment is eternal perdition. He will suffer in the lake of fire forever. The Gospels speak of the Gehenna of fire (Matt. 5:22). Luke 16:19-31 speaks of the story of Lazarus and the rich man. It indicates that an unbeliever will suffer in the fire of Hades after he dies. This shows that the fire of Hades is for now. When an unbeliever dies, he will go straight to Hades to suffer its fire. The Bible is very clear and explicit about death, judgment, hell, and the lake of fire. In preaching the gospel, we cannot be general. General preaching will only produce general results. Every gospel preacher must have something specific and particular. Some preachings specialize in judgment; they make people feel the horror of judgment. Paul was a good example. He knew the terror of judgment, and he made others feel this terror (Acts 24:25).</p><p>A man can receive the Lord through a message on the evil of sin, or he can receive the Lord through a message on the terror of hell. It is hard to find a person who is good in every subject. Do not think that you are a champion in everything. You have to find your specialty. As long as you can develop a specialty, you can save men. Some are good at preaching about hell; they can make people fear and even tremble. Once when Charles Finney was preaching, men held on to the pillars of the chapel for fear of falling into hell. One of his specialties was the terror of hell. In order to pry something open, we have to use a sharp and pointed knife. The same is true in preaching the gospel. All we need is one specialty; there is no need to be too broad. In learning to preach the gospel, you do not need to learn everything. If a man tries to be good in every subject, he will end up not being good in any of them. It is best if some brothers can specialize on judgment.</p><h2 class="head2">The World</h2><p>What is the world? It is the pleasures of sin. When the book of Hebrews speaks of the pleasures of sin, it refers to the enjoyment in Egypt, which is a type of the world (11:25). Many people are afraid that they will have to give up the pleasures and enjoyment of the world once they believe in the Lord. A gospel preacher should show others that even gaining the whole world means nothing if one loses his own life. What can one give in exchange for his own life (Matt. 16:26)? The Lord Jesus gave a wonderful parable in the Gospel of Luke. The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly, so he wanted to build larger barns to gather his wheat and goods. Then he said to his own soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry." God, however, said to him, "Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?" (12:16-20).</p><p>In John 4:13 the Lord said to the Samaritan woman, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." To be thirsty is to be dissatisfied. The Lord's word clearly shows that a man can be satisfied by the world temporarily, but he soon will be dissatisfied. A man can never be fully and constantly satisfied. This is the very nature of the vanity of the world. Every drink in the world makes a person thirsty again. A man can receive something from the world, but this only makes him thirsty for more. The water of this world will never satisfy. It is better to accept the Lord. This kind of presentation can become a key to pry men open and to lead them to the Lord.</p><p>The rich man in Luke 16 made merry every day in splendor, but he suffered in the fire of hell in the end. The world is empty. In speaking about the vanity of the world, you have to use the book of Ecclesiastes. You have to show others that there is indeed nothing worth pursuing in this world. It is most foolish to waste one's years in the vanity of the world. The Lord Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." He also said that He had another kind of water. This is the living water which enters into man and satisfies his thirst. The water that the Lord gives satisfies man in his inner being. Once a man is satisfied inwardly, he will no longer crave outward things. We have to show them that many people who were once empty and thirsty have now realized that their vanity and thirst have turned into satisfaction and joy through receiving the living water of God. This living water of God has satisfied their thirst, and they do not need worldly pleasure any longer.</p><p>It would be difficult to find another woman in this world as evil as the Samaritan woman. She was not satisfied with one husband; she went and picked out another. Not being satisfied again, she went and picked out yet another. In the end she was not satisfied with any of them. She was seeking for satisfaction in the human life. Her switching of husbands was the ultimate symptom of her pursuit of human satisfaction. She first was married to one man, thinking that she would be satisfied. When he did not satisfy her, she changed to another one. This went on five times, and she was still not satisfied. This is exactly what the Lord meant when He said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." She was never satisfied. Every enjoyment of this world only satisfies temporarily; it is never a genuine and eternal satisfaction. There is no satisfied person on this earth, and there is no happy person on this earth. To a woman, a husband is the most secure thing. Yet this woman was not satisfied with her husbands. It goes without saying that nothing else would satisfy her. The world can offer only salt water; a man becomes thirstier after drinking it. Many people indulge themselves in the pleasures and enjoyments of this world, but they are trying to quench their thirst with salt water. Once a man has the Lord, he will be satisfied inwardly, and he will no longer be thirsty.</p><p>If you resolve to take this line of preaching, you should give up trying to do well in everything else. A gospel preacher should not think that he can do everything. If the Lord wants you to take this line, you should honor this line. You should spend time dwelling on this line and developing this line. Each person has to find a line that best suits him; he cannot imitate others. Never waste time on a line that does not suit you; that is a mere waste of energy. In preaching the gospel, the key is not to learn many methods but to get men saved. You have to develop your own specialty. Everyone needs to have his own line. Today the Lord is taking the way of the Body. If we all will coordinate together, we will be able to preach the full gospel of God. Evangelism is a work that belongs to the whole church; no individual can do the job perfectly. We are merely members of the Body. For this reason each of us must have our own specialty. When all the specialties are added together, we have the perfect and full gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Love</h2><p>Next let us take a look at the three positive subjects. In preaching the negative subjects, we only have to touch them briefly and give others a deep impression of these things. When we move on to the positive subjects, however, we can stay on them continually. We only need to touch sin, judgment, and the world briefly, but we can come back again and again to the positive subjects such as the love of God. Love is a matter of the heart. God is love, and God loves the world. His heart is one that loves sinners and desires their salvation. Many people, however, do not want to be saved. The Lord said to the Pharisees, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" (John 5:40). God is not unwilling to give His life to man or to save man, but man is unwilling to accept what God gives! The Lord also said to Jerusalem, "How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!" (Matt. 23:37). The Lord was eager to protect and save them, but they would not want to come under His protection and saving. Today many people think that God's goal is to condemn man. They think that God does not want to save them even though they may want to be saved. This is man's thought; it is a great misunderstanding of God. Many people think that it is a difficult thing to be saved. They think that God is reluctant to save them. But God is love, and He seeks out men and desires that they be saved. The Lord Jesus said, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" (Luke 19:10). We do not seek salvation, knock at the gate of heaven, and plead for God to open the gate for us. Rather, God seeks to save us, and He came to us Himself to save us. God does not hate us; rather, He loves us and wants us to be saved. A leper came to the Lord and entreated Him, saying, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me." The Lord stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed!" (Mark 1:40-41). God is willing! God is wanting! God is seeking! Are we willing? Do we want to be saved? God is willing, but are we willing?</p><p>This way of presenting the gospel will induce many to receive salvation. This is a broad way. Man is prone to accept the devil's thoughts. The devil says, "Even though you may want to be saved and go to heaven, God may not want you." Man always thinks that it is a hard thing to be saved, but we have to tell the sinners, "God is willing, but are you willing?" God desires all men be saved (1 Tim. 2:4). This is God's heart. God loves us so much that He desires that we all be saved. How much man has misunderstood God's heart! God is willing to save man. This is God's love. He intended to save us long ago. He sent His Son to us. By Him our sins can be forgiven, and we can draw near to God. We are not the ones who seek to be saved. God is the One who seeks to save us. Luke 15 shows us that it is not the prodigal son that wanted to be saved, but the father who had loved the prodigal son. While the prodigal son was still struggling afar off, trying to come up with the right reason to convince his father, the father was waiting day and night for his return. The son did not realize that his father was influenced only by love (vv. 17-20). Those who reason do not know God's love. Do not reason and do not worry whether or not God will accept you. Man tries to persuade God to have compassion on him. But God is love itself. We do not have to change God or appeal to Him in any way. God is love. Man thinks that God is severe, fearsome, and hardened, but God said, "The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exo. 34:6). Again He said, "Taste and see that Jehovah is good; / Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him" (Psa. 34:8). Oh, that all men would come to know His love, taste His goodness, and trust in Him!</p><p>This is another line. We must have a line when we preach the gospel. If a man tries to be good at everything, he will end up being good at nothing. Of course, there are times of exception, and we can resort to other ways during these times, but we always should have a specific line that we can call our own.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Righteousness</h2><p>God's righteousness is related to the work the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross. Love relates to God's heart, while righteousness relates to God's procedure, His way. Some gospel preachers do not emphasize God's love; rather, they emphasize the accomplished work of the Lord Jesus on the cross. This is the line of God's righteousness. God crucified the Lord Jesus on the cross for our sins. He no longer can save men according to His whims and likes. He has to save men according to the cross. He is bound by the cross. Before the cross, God could save men according to His desires and likes. The cross, however, removes God's freedom to choose. As long as man accepts the redemption of the cross, God must save. Since the redemption of the cross is an accomplished fact, God has to justify all those who come to Him through the cross. The Lord Jesus has died for me on the cross. Now I can come to God through His cross. Whether or not God is willing to save me, I will be saved. This is the righteousness of God.</p><p>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The Lord Jesus shed His precious blood for us. When we come to God through Him, God must save us. He must forgive us. He does not have a choice. If He loves us, we will be saved. If He does not love us, we still will be saved. God is love, but He is also righteousness. He saves us according to His righteousness. Hallelujah! The cross is our handle, our leverage. It is a handle given to us by God. This is the gospel of righteousness. God has accomplished His work, and no one can change it.</p><p>We also have the last part of Romans 4, which says that Christ was raised for our justification (v. 25). In other words, Christ could not have resurrected if we were not justified. We can also say that except for our justification, Christ would not have resurrected. In God's eyes Christ was allowed to be resurrected only after our case before Him was settled through the work of the cross. The fact that Christ has resurrected proves that our case is settled. This is the reason it says that Christ was raised for, or on the basis of, our justification. Looking at it another way, since Christ has resurrected, God will always justify us whenever we come to God through Him. This is another line, a very strong line. This line lays hold of God's righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">A Living Faith</h2><p>The sixth way to preach the gospel is to lead people to a living faith. What is a living faith? It is when man's heart turns to God and touches Him. This is the meaning of a living faith. God's Word says, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart." Therefore, with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation (Rom. 10:8, 10). Believing in the heart is touching the Lord with the heart. This is all that is needed. Some people think that a man has to be clear about the gospel before he can be saved; they try to present the gospel as fully as possible. But in actuality, as soon as a man touches the Lord and says with his mouth, "Lord," he is saved. On his way to Damascus, the Lord only said to Paul, "Why are you persecuting Me?" Paul only opened his mouth, saying, "Lord," and he was saved (Acts 9:3-6). He became clear about gospel truths later. The thief who was crucified with the Lord mocked Him first. Later, he had a turn within. He touched the Lord and was saved. He was not clear about the gospel. As long as some people turn their heart to the Lord and call on Him with their mouth, they are saved even though they are not clear about the gospel.</p><p>The seed of the gospel is the word of God (1 Pet. 1:23). Once a man touches God's word, he is saved. This is a wonderful thing. Sometimes we do not have to present the word of the gospel too clearly. As long as we can lead men to the Lord, they will be saved. This is another way. This way does not emphasize the speaking of the word, but the act of prayer. Once a man prays, he becomes clear. The way does not involve being clear about the gospel first, but praying first. The key to this way is to bring men to God. This is all that is needed. Once a man is saved, he can be taught the truth. Before he is saved, we should not worry whether or not he is clear. Just bring him to God, and he will be saved.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE CONCENTRATING ON HIS OWN SPECIALTY,<br />AND THE WHOLE BODY COORDINATING TOGETHER<br />FOR THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Generally speaking, the Bible gives us these six lines, and gospel preachers in the past generally have taken these six lines. In order to learn to preach the gospel well, we have to pick one of these six lines. Today the preaching of the gospel is not the work of evangelists alone; the whole church has to rise up. Every brother and sister in the church has to do the work of an evangelist. We have to pursue deeper spiritual experiences, but at the same time, everyone has to do the work of the evangelist. No one can use spiritual pursuit as an excuse for not preaching the gospel. On the contrary, the deeper a man pursues after spiritual life, the better he should be at preaching the gospel. This is the complete work that has been entrusted to the church. Everyone has to preach the gospel, and everyone has to have his own line of preaching the gospel. We must all present ourselves to God and ask Him to show us a clear way. This way will bring in the Lord's blessing. After He has shown us the way, we have to dig deep into it.</p><p>Each one of us has to be perfected in one of these ways. We have to pray to God and seek after Him. We have to give our thoughts and our time to it. We have to build up our own topics and material for the gospel. We should not imitate others; we should pay attention to our own specialty. We should do everything to develop our specialty. If everyone develops his own specialty, the preaching of the church will be complete. We will only succeed if we tackle the matter from every different angle. Those who can save souls are wise. If one line will not work in one place and the needs are not met, we have to change to a different line. If one person is not enough to meet the need, we can ask other brothers to come and help us. We should never be proud in the matter of preaching the gospel; we must learn to coordinate. In this way more sinners will be saved.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 24, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A SINNER<br />TO TURN HIS HEART TO THE LORD</h2><h2 class="head2">Paying Attention to What Sinners Should Do</h2><p>The subject of our discussion this time is how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, rather than how God accomplishes His work through the gospel. Once we are clear how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, we will know how to preach the gospel. If a sinner has a subjective grasp of how he is saved at the time he receives the gospel, he will know how to convey the same gospel to others. Many times when we preach the gospel, we do not know what sinners need. This is the reason we waste so much time.</p><p>There are two basic truths with regard to preaching the gospel. The first is the work of God which He has accomplished in Christ. God's work in Christ consists of His sending the Lord Jesus to the cross. By shedding His blood and dying on the cross, Christ redeemed us from our sins. God raised up the Lord Jesus because He satisfied God's righteousness. This is a basic truth in the gospel of God. Of course, this is a very important truth, but as far as the sinner is concerned, this truth is a past act. A sinner must do something else before he can be saved. Hence, there is a second step: God must send His Spirit to man. God transmits the past work of Christ to us by sending the Holy Spirit. This also is a basic truth of the gospel. If the Spirit does not come, we cannot be saved even though the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption and God is ready to receive us. Without the Holy Spirit, the work of the Lord Jesus is objective; it cannot be subjective to us. It is outside of us; it cannot be ours inwardly. It belongs to God alone and cannot be ours as well. The coming of the Holy Spirit applies Christ's accomplished work to us. The question now is: What should the sinner do? The Lord Jesus has finished His work, and the Holy Spirit is waiting to operate in the sinner. How then can the sinner be saved? Among gospel preachers, some emphasize repentance, while others emphasize faith. Still others emphasize confession. What should a sinner do before he can be saved? This is what we have to find out today.</p><p>Gospel preachers today are subconsciously affected by their own theology in their preaching. They lay up in store three things for the sinners. The first is a collection of gospel truths. The second is a mixture of exhortations on the vanity of the world and the evil of sins, etc. The third is some demand for actions, such as repentance, confession, prayer, believing, or baptism. Most gospel preachers today are well equipped in these few categories of things. This is their basic arsenal. They first try to help people to understand a collection of gospel truths. Then they lead them to take some action, thinking that a man will be saved by taking these actions. But is this practice biblical at all? What does the Bible teach concerning the preaching of the gospel? We have to point out a few examples from the Bible. In the New Testament, we find many people believing in the Lord and being saved; we find this in the Gospels and in Acts. But how did the Lord Jesus and the apostles lead these ones to salvation? From their pattern, we can learn how we should preach the gospel to sinners, and how wrong our ways are today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ONLY CRITERIA FOR RECEIVING SALVATION&mdash;<br />THE HEART TOUCHING THE LORD</h2><p>Luke 7:36-50 speaks of a sinful woman being forgiven of her sins. She was full of gratitude to the Lord for the forgiveness she received. She realized that the multitude of her sins had not stopped the Lord from forgiving her. This led her to appreciate the Lord's love. She was not conscious of any condition for believing; she simply felt the Lord's compassion. She touched the Lord with her heart, and she was full of gratitude for His salvation. That was all she did to be saved. Believing simply means touching the Lord with the heart. In preaching the gospel, our emphasis should not be on how much men understand salvation. As long as they touch the Lord once, their sins are forgiven. The woman was forgiven of all her sins because she loved much. Once she exercised her love to touch the Lord, she was saved.</p><p>In Luke 18:13-14 the Lord said, "But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner! I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted." Here was a man who was saved. He did not have to make any so-called commitment. He did not have any spiritual knowledge. He only felt that he was a sinner and prayed for God to be propitiated to him. That was all he did to be saved. When a man comes to God, we do not have to worry if he understands the truth of the gospel. As long as his heart turns to God, he is saved. For this reason, we do not have to pay too much attention to what we preach concerning God's accomplishments for us. All we need to do is to make the sinners feel that they have sinned and make them come to God.</p><p>Luke 15 speaks of the parable of the return of the prodigal son. He was able to return home because he came to himself. This is all that was needed. Once the prodigal son came to himself and decided to turn back to his father and confess his sin, he was saved. In saving men, we do not have to make them understand too much. It is enough to have a sincere heart to come to God. We can help them understand the truth of the gospel later.</p><p>Luke 19:1-10 is the story of Zaccheus's salvation. His "seeing" was similar to the "touching" of the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:25-30). Many people pressed against the Lord, but He did not feel anything. As soon as the woman with the issue of blood touched Him, however, He felt something. The look of Zaccheus was the same. Once he looked, the Lord's attention was drawn towards him. Our Lord does not save anyone who does not care to be saved; He saves only those who are eager to be saved. He does not save the pressing ones; He only saves the touching ones. He does not save the noise-loving crowd; He only saves those who have come purposely to look for Him. Zaccheus was saved because he was intent on seeing the Lord. His penetrating concern earned him the Lord's salvation. Once a man's heart stretches out, the Lord's attention is drawn to it.</p><p>In Luke 23:39-43 we find the two thieves being crucified with the Lord mocking Him at the beginning. Before one of them died, however, he suddenly had a change of heart. He said to the Lord, "Remember me when You come into Your kingdom." His heart was stirred up to touch the Lord, and his whole being was drawn forward. Although his words missed the mark, the Lord knew his heart. The Lord was not wrong. He answered him, saying, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise." As soon as the thief's heart was stirred up, the Lord saved him. His salvation was not dependent on the amount of doctrine he knew.</p><p>In John 4:1-10 the Lord preached the gospel to the Samaritan woman. He did not explain the truth of the gospel to her in detail. He did not tell her how He was going to die for her. He only said, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water." The Lord's word shows that God is willing to grant men salvation. As long as a sinner says in his heart, "This is the Savior that I need," he will be saved immediately. We have to follow our Lord's example. The most economical way to preach the gospel is to save the most number of men with the least amount of teaching.</p><p>John 8:3-11 speaks of the salvation of a woman spared of her judgment. She was a sinful woman, and there was no question that she should be condemned. Yet the Lord said to those who caught her, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." In this picture we see three parties. There was the sinful woman, fearfully waiting for the pronouncement of her judgment. There were the prosecutors and the crowd. As soon as they were challenged by the Lord, their consciences pricked them. They knew that they were sinful, and they left one by one. Finally, there was the Lord Jesus. Only He was without sin, yet He would not condemn the woman. Instead, He forgave her and granted her salvation. We have to pay attention to this picture. The Lord was sinless, while the woman was sinful and in shame. Both the sinless One and the sinful one were there. When the Lord asked, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?", she immediately replied, "No one, Lord." Here was a tender spirit, a stricken spirit. The woman did not do anything; she only said, "Lord..." The Lord replied, "Neither do I condemn you." She was saved. As long as a person humbles his spirit and acknowledges the Lord as Lord, he will be saved. How wonderful are God's accomplishments and how simple are man's requirements!</p><p>Acts 2:14-36 tells us how the apostles preached and how men were saved through the gospel at the time of Pentecost. In his preaching, Peter did not give lucid orations. The words he spoke were words taught by the Spirit. He only spoke about the humbling and exaltation of Christ, about Jesus of Nazareth, the despised One, being made Lord and Christ by God. As he spoke, the listening Jews were pricked in their hearts. There is no need to use articulate teachings to bring men to salvation. All that is needed is a little speaking. The first thing one should do is to save men; expounding the truth comes afterwards. We have to save the greatest number of people with the least belaboring of truth. As long as we can turn men's hearts back to God, our job is done. Peter did not give a clear presentation of the gospel truth at Pentecost; he waited until the book of 2 Peter to do this.</p><p>Acts 10:34-43 gives us an account of Peter's preaching in the house of Cornelius. All he did was to recount the Lord's acts on earth. When he said at the end, "Through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins," the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the gospel (v. 44). In preaching the gospel, all that one has to do is to bring the sinner to God; there is no need to insist that they understand too much of the teaching concerning salvation. The same can be said of our own understanding of the truths of salvation; we only understood them gradually after we were saved. All that a sinner needs is a little word concerning salvation. In Cornelius's house, the Spirit was waiting to come down. Today the Lord is waiting for sinners. As soon as their hearts are touched, they will be saved. In the past we have paid much attention to Christ's accomplished redemption for us before God. Today we are studying how the gospel brings about salvation in the heart of sinners. Being saved is not a question of knowledge but of a sinner touching God.</p><p>Romans 10:8-13 shows us that when a man believes unto salvation, he is not believing in the reason, the doctrine, or the history of salvation. In preaching the gospel, the main thing is not to preach a doctrine but to tell men that this salvation is now in our mouth and even in our heart. The gospel is a matter of the mouth and the heart. It is a hard thing for men to be saved by any kind of work. Today the word of the gospel is for all men; everyone can receive it. As long as a man confesses with his mouth and believes in his heart, he will be saved. "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Once a man calls and says, "Lord Jesus," he is saved, and salvation comes into him. All it takes is for a man to believe in his heart and confess with his mouth. How perfect is the work of salvation before God, and how simple it is for man to receive it.</p><h2 class="head1">STUDYING THE WAYS PEOPLE ARE SAVED</h2><p>In addition to studying the examples in the Bible, we have to study how salvation has come about in the brothers and sisters. If we check with many brothers and sisters, we will realize that they were all saved through coming to God once in a genuine and sincere way. It takes some time to study their history one by one. After we have studied them thoroughly, we will find that some were saved one way and some were saved another way. We will know the kind of things we should do when we meet certain kinds of people. In preaching the gospel, we would rather sacrifice our sermon for the sake of saving more men. Never try to present a clear doctrine at the expense of bringing men to God. We are not here to preach a beautiful message on the gospel; we are here to save men. We have to open their hearts to the Lord, and we have to open their mouths to Him. Once a man opens his heart to the Lord and calls on Him, he is saved.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 25, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">BASED ON THE LORD AS A FRIEND TO SINNERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Needing Very Much Truth for Salvation,<br />Coming to God Only with a Sincere Heart</h2><p>In the previous message, we saw from the New Testament that many people were saved without being very clear about the gospel truths. Because of the influence of tradition, many gospel preachers think that they need a great deal of truth and a thorough and lucid presentation of the gospel that addresses the entire range of human problems before men can be saved. Many workers do not expect men to be saved immediately. They try to help people to understand many doctrines. As a result, the salvation of many people is delayed. Sinners also procrastinate in their decision because gospel preachers have this attitude. They think that they have to be a little clearer about the gospel and understand a little more about the truth of the Bible. Often, they delay their own salvation through their perceived ignorance of the gospel.</p><p>If we are experienced in this matter and have thoroughly researched it, we will agree that some have not received much truth before they are saved. Yet they have stepped forward with a simple heart to touch the Lord. These ones bear a much stronger testimony before the Lord than those who are saved only after understanding a detailed exposition of the truth. In our preaching of the gospel, we should always exercise ourselves to discern how much truth a person needs before his heart will turn to God for salvation. In the Bible every person who was saved did not turn after understanding many doctrines. They only knew a little, but it was enough for them to come to God. In preaching the gospel, we do not have to apply a heavy dose of doctrines; a little truth is good enough. The extent and amount of the truth needed for the occasion depends on our own judgment. All that is needed is for a man to understand enough for his heart to turn to God.</p><h2 class="head2">Spending Time to Study How Men Are Saved</h2><p>First we have to ask ourselves: How much Bible truth did we understand when we were saved? In studying the examples in the Bible and in reviewing the history of our own salvation as well as those of others, we find that many people were saved by listening to just two or three sentences of gospel truth. Some people are even saved by hearing something totally unrelated to the gospel. Indeed, a man's salvation is not dependent on the amount of words he hears concerning salvation. As workers, we have to keep a record of the kind of words that precipitate salvation in various kinds of people. We will realize that not everyone is saved by great, long sermons. Instead, many are saved by one or two words. Their hearts are stirred up to touch the Lord, and they are saved. Once we have done such a study, we will become wiser in our preaching. We will find that everyone in this world is more or less the same; there are not too many different kinds of people. The ways men accept the gospel can be grouped, at the most, into a few categories. Some people are saved by one kind of speaking. Others are saved by another kind of speaking. Men can be identified by types, and there are not too many different types. Some people are of a certain disposition, and they are saved by a certain kind of speaking. When we meet a person of similar disposition, we can lead him to salvation with the same kind of speaking. It takes time to research and study the way people are saved. If we do this, we will become very skillful at leading men to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">JESUS BEING A FRIEND OF SINNERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Friendship Being an Extraordinary Relationship</h2><p>The Bible says that Jesus is a friend of sinners (Matt. 11:19). What is the meaning of a friend? A friend is a person whom one loves in an extraordinary relationship. Friendship is a relationship that is out of the ordinary, that pays no regard to status. Master-servant relationships, spousal relationships, sibling relationships, and parent-children relationships are all ordinary relationships. Friendship is an intimacy that goes beyond these relationships. Friends are people who are not linked to each other by ordinary relationships, but who love one another and are drawn to one another apart from such ordinary relationships. Such ones may be fathers and sons, but they are also friends apart and aside from their father-son relationship. This means that friendship is a relationship that has no regard for status. Some people are employer and employee. As far as their statuses are concerned, there is a difference of rank. However, they can also be friends apart from such a normal relationship.</p><h2 class="head2">A Sinner Can Approach the Lord<br />without "Proper" Procedures</h2><p>The Lord is God, and we are man. He is the Savior, and we are sinners. These are the obvious relationships. But the Lord is also willing to establish a friendship with us outside of such normal relationships. Hence, the Bible calls Abraham the friend of God (2 Chron. 20:7; James 2:23b). God was able to be a friend to Abraham because He put aside His own status. Abraham also put aside his status. In this way the two became friends with each other. The Lord Jesus is the Savior, and we are sinners; this is the "normal" relationship. Under this normal relationship, there are "proper" procedures. For example, a sinner must believe and be baptized before he can be saved. This is the proper procedure under a normal relationship. The Bible, however,  has a wonderful declaration: the Lord Jesus is also a friend of sinners. This is a great thing. This means that apart from the normal relationship of Savior with sinners, there is another relationship&mdash;that of a friend. A sinner can bypass the "proper" procedure and confer with Him as a friend. He can ask the Lord, "How are you going to save me?" In other words, a sinner can receive the Lord as the Savior without going through the proper procedures of salvation such as repentance, confession, believing, receiving, and baptism. Under normal circumstances, a sinner must go through these steps before he can be saved. But thank the Lord that He is also a friend of sinners. We can come to Him as His friends.</p><p>Sinners can come to the Savior and ask for help as His friends without going through the "proper" procedures. For example, there was a man in the Bible who wanted to believe the Lord but was not able to. He cried to the Lord, saying, "Help my unbelief!" (Mark 9:24). Here was a man who was in unbelief. Yet he could still come to the Lord and ask for help. This is friendship. Consider the example of Luke 18:18-23. The young ruler wanted to inherit eternal life, and the Lord charged him to sell all he had, distribute to the poor, and follow Him. The young ruler could not do this, and he left sorrowfully. The Lord wanted him to sell his all; this is the proper procedure under a proper relationship. The young ruler felt that he could not comply. He should have come back to the Lord and conferred with Him based on the relationship of a friend and said, "I cannot make it. What should I do? Please help me!" The Lord surely would have helped him. Unfortunately he did not make use of this friendship to confer with the Lord. Instead, he turned away in sorrow.</p><h2 class="head2">Friendship Being Unconditional</h2><p>Because the Lord Jesus is the friend of all the sinners, they are able to come to Him just as they are. They can confer with Him and seek His help. Originally, a sinner could only come to the Lord according to the proper procedure. But if he comes to Him as a friend, this approach is unconditional. A sinner can approach the Lord boldly just as he is. Suppose a father demands that his son be obedient to him. If the son does not obey him, he has trespassed in terms of his proper relationship with his father. Yet apart from this proper relationship, the son can approach the father as a friend and say, "I cannot obey you. What should I do? Please help me." The father can tell the son what he must do to obey based on their relationship as friends. In this way, the friendly relationship can make up for the breakdown in the proper relationship. A gospel preacher should allow a sinner to receive salvation under any condition. He can even forget all conditions and bring the sinner to the Lord with no conditions specified whatsoever.</p><p>The initial step of the gospel is for a sinner to treat the Lord as his friend. The consummate step of the gospel is for a sinner to treat Him as the Savior. Some may ask, "If a person does not believe in God, how can he come to God?" Even if a man does not believe in God, he can still come to Him. Under proper conditions, a man must believe in God before he can come to Him (Heb. 11:6). But as long as a man calls on God, he will be saved. Man thinks that he has to acquire a certain amount of faith before he can come to God, but this is wrong. The Lord is a friend of sinners. Anyone can come to Him and be saved. Under proper conditions, a man has to repent when he comes to the Savior. But if a man comes to the Lord by acknowledging Him as the friend of sinners, he can come to Him even without repentance. If our preaching is based on the fact that the Lord is a friend to sinners, we will bring sinners to the Lord immediately. Once we push a sinner into the presence of the Lord, something will happen.</p><h2 class="head1">WHOSOEVER WILL CAN COME TO THE LORD</h2><p>We have to allow the Lord Himself to work on the sinners. We should not preach the gospel according to our own concepts. There is no sinner on earth who is so evil that he cannot pray. There is no sinner whose condition is so hopeless that he cannot be brought to the Lord. No matter what kind of sin a person has committed, no matter what kind of person he is, he can come to the Lord because the Lord is a friend of sinners. It is the Spirit who operates to bring men to repentance and to reject the world. If we realize that the Lord is a friend of sinners, the nature of our gospel will be uplifted, and our gospel will be greatly changed. First, we must have a strong assurance of this fact. We must believe in this fact, and then we can bring many people to salvation through our preaching.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 26, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">CREATING A DESIRE IN MAN'S HEART</h2><h2 class="head2">Salvation Being Realized When a Man's Heart Reaches Out to Touch the Lord</h2><p>We have covered the things that happen to a sinner when he receives salvation. A man is saved by reaching out his heart to touch the Lord. He is not saved through the knowledge of salvation or through understanding the doctrine of the gospel. When he exercises a sincere heart to touch the Lord, he is saved. As those who are learning to preach the gospel, we should study the way God works on man at the time of his salvation. The more we acquire a subjective understanding of the experience of those who are saved, the easier it is for us to lead men to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S HEART BEING THE CONFLUENCE OF A MAN</h2><p>We have said that a man is saved when his heart reaches out to touch the Lord, but what is the heart? The word heart is a very particular word in the Bible. Man's physical body has a heart&mdash;a physical heart. His soul also has a heart&mdash;a psychological heart. In addition, there is a part in his spirit which relates to the heart&mdash;the conscience. Hence, we can say that the heart is the confluence of the whole person. A man's thoughts issue from his heart (Gen. 6:5; Matt. 15:19). His deliberations&mdash;a function of the will&mdash;also issue from his heart (Acts 11:23). His joy&mdash;a function of the emotion&mdash;also issues from the heart (John 16:22). Hebrews 10:22 says that the conscience is in the heart. Ephesians 3 says that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith (v. 17). Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34b). The center of man is his heart. Both his soul and spirit are tied to his heart. We can say that the heart is the confluence of the total man, the convergent point of man's entire life. The heart represents his true self. Everything related to his life issues from the heart. This is the reason Proverbs 4:23 speaks of keeping the heart with all vigilance, because out of it come the issues of life. The heart is man's true self, the spot where his spirit, soul, and body converge.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD TOUCHING THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS<br />FOR MAN'S SALVATION</h2><p>Man's heart is deceitful above all things and it is incurable. Who can know it? (Jer. 17:9). It is full of darkness, and no one can see it. An unsaved person is hardened inwardly because of the darkness of his heart. The spirit of a fallen man is dead, his body can do nothing about his salvation, and his soul is not motivated to seek after God. Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually (Gen. 6:5; Matt. 15:19). A man who is darkened in mind and void of feelings has no intention to choose God; he has no desire for salvation. How can such a person receive salvation? Man's spirit is not the understanding organ, and in fact, it is dead before regeneration. Man's body is useless in this endeavor as well. His mind is darkened, his emotion is indifferent, and his will is uncertain. What should we do about such a man? We can give him good food or fresh air for his body, but these cannot influence his salvation. A man's body has no influence over his salvation. The Lord does not work through man's body because the body has been sold under sin (Rom. 7:14). After man fell and became fleshly, God no longer strove with his flesh (Gen. 6:3). If we try to communicate spiritual things to a fallen man, he will not receive it because his spirit is altogether dead. One whose spirit has not yet come alive will not understand the things related to the kingdom of God. Since the biological side and the spiritual side of a man are helpless in bringing him to salvation, God has to deal with the seat of his consciousness, that is, He has to deal with the mind, emotion, and will. The mind, emotion, and will together make up the conscious part of a man. How does a man with such consciousness interact with God, and how does he react to salvation?</p><h2 class="head2">In His Mind</h2><p>Romans 1:21 says that the mind of an unbeliever is darkened and vain in reasonings. He is an ignorant and foolish man as far as salvation is concerned. Since this is the condition of the sinners we are dealing with in our preaching, how can we turn their ignorance into enlightenment and their darkened thoughts into light? There is no way to do this. Just as it is impossible to tell a darkened room to transform itself into light, there is no way for us to make a darkened mind bright and shining again. We should not presume that we can enlighten a man's mind by simply relating the truth to him in a clear way. Many times when we argue with sinners we turn them away. Many times we defeat the excuses of the sinners, yet their mind remains dark. We win the argument, yet lose the soul. First Corinthians 1:21 says that the world through its wisdom did not know God because its thoughts were darkened. First Corinthians 2:9 also says that God's salvation is something that has not come up in man's heart. Hence, man's mind is fully darkened with respect to salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">In His Emotion</h2><p>What about the desires in man's emotion? Romans 3:11 says, "There is none who understands, there is none who seeks out God." There is none who understands&mdash;this refers to the mind, and there is none who seeks out God&mdash;this refers to the emotion. In John 5:40 the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life." They were not willing to come to the Lord because they had no desire or hunger to do so. In Matthew 13:15 the Lord said, "For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them." The Jews were not able to understand because they rejected in their heart. They did not have the desire in their hearts to be saved. They could not understand salvation because they did not want it. If their eyes could see and their ears could hear, their minds would understand. Hence, in order for a sinner to be saved, the first gate he has to pass through is the understanding. The second gate is his willingness and desire to be saved. Yet before a man can will and desire, he must first want to be saved, like to be saved, and hope to be saved. Otherwise, he will only run away from salvation. John 15:23-25 says that man's emotion has no desire for the Lord; on the contrary, it hates Him without a cause. It mocks believers without reason and considers it a shame to be called a Christian. The unbelievers behave this way because they are ignorant. They do not seek after God and have no desire for the Lord. Instead they hate Him.</p><h2 class="head2">In His Will</h2><p>Next we come to the will. The will is the organ of deliberation. An unbeliever decides within himself to reject the Lord. In Matthew 23:37 the Lord said, "How often I desired...and you would not!" The Lord was determined to give, but the Jews were determined to reject. They were determined to reject the Lord. From this point forward they were fully rejected in return. Read Romans 6:17 again: "But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which you were delivered." The Jews were rejected by the Lord through their own rejection of Him. Those who have believed have obeyed from their heart. They have decided that they want Him. God commands man to repent. A man only has to be willing to believe. The Holy Spirit will come to those who obey.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TURNS THE HEART</h2><p>The Bible says that a man must believe before he can be saved. Faith is a thing of the heart. This is the reason the book of Hebrews associates unbelief with an "evil heart" (3:12). Romans 10:9-10 says that a man has to believe in his heart. In order for a sinner to believe, he must understand with his mind, desire with his emotion, and deliberately decide with his will. His mind, emotion, and will have to turn. A good gospel preacher knows how to turn a sinner's mind, stir up his desire, and pin down his will. If he does this, his preaching will prevail.</p><p>Today a preacher of the gospel faces a fundamental temptation, or, we may say, a fundamental error. He only pays attention to turning man's mind. He wants to impart nice doctrines into man's mind and to clarify his mental faculty concerning the subject of salvation. Such a person does not know the constitution of a sinner. He thinks that a man must understand the gospel before he can be saved. He does not realize that a sinner's thoughts are very shallow indeed. He may understand what he hears, but he will still reject it. What will the preacher do then? We have to understand that man's mind cannot entirely represent his heart. It is wrong for a gospel preacher to pay attention only to the mind. The mind is the most superficial and outward part of man's heart. Even if a preacher can convince others with doctrines, they will still not believe. The quickest way to touch man's heart is through the mind. However, it is also the most unreliable and ineffective way because the mind is the shallowest part of man's heart.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KEY TO PREACHING</h2><p>We must realize that man's entire heart is darkened with respect to salvation. His heart is hardened, wicked, satanic, fleshly, and worldly. It is impossible for such a heart to believe in the Lord. Before the Holy Spirit operates on our gospel friends, it is impossible for them to believe in the Lord. Therefore, we must trust in the Holy Spirit for our preaching. We have to use God's word to open the sinner's heart and to create something in it that was not there before. The goal of the gospel is to gain a beachhead in man's heart and to expand such a beachhead. This is the key to preaching. There is no desire for God within the heart of a fallen man. It is filled with evil. In order for a sinner to receive salvation, the first thing we have to do is to create a place for God within his heart with the words of the gospel. Only then will a person accept the gospel. When our words go out, they first lodge in the mind of the listener. Then the mind becomes the gateway for salvation. Next God gains the desire of the heart, and finally He gains the will of the man. Hence, it is not enough to merely gain the mind. When God's word enters a sinner, the first thing that happens to him is the forming of some new thoughts. These new thoughts create a new desire for salvation in him. Next he resolves within himself to be saved. Once he makes this resolution, the gospel breaks through in him.</p><p>Hence, the goal of the gospel is to create a desire in man. There are three objectives in the process of preaching: 1) The initial objective is to put certain ideas in man about salvation so that he begins to understand a little about God and salvation. 2) The chief objective of preaching is to make men seek after God, to create a desire for Him and an inclination for salvation. 3) The ultimate goal of preaching is to cause men to choose God. The gospel does not conquer man through his understanding but through his desire. Creating such a desire within man is the main goal of preaching. In preaching the gospel, the first thing we have to do is to undergird man's thoughts with God's word. The final step, however, is always to lead him to a decision. First, we have to lodge God's word, the sure word, into man's mind. Then we follow this first word with a second word to pry him open, to create in him a desire. Finally, we should lead him to a decision. The first word is a "straight hook," while the second word is a "curved hook." The first word provides a support in the thoughts. The second word is a tool to pry open the emotion. The result is a deliberate decision in the will to receive salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL FACTOR BEING DESIRE</h2><p>All good gospel preachers first deposit a few words in the sinners' mind and then pry open and stir up their desire with more words. Lastly, they invite and urge the sinners to believe. This is how they turn the sinners around. Matthew 13:15 contains three words: lest, understand, and turn. The word understand relates to the mind. The word lest implies a possibility of stirring up of one's desire. The word turn relates to one's decision. A man does not understand because he does not have the desire to understand, and he does not see light because his heart has no desire for such light. Most of the time the problem is not with man's mind or thoughts. The problem is with the motivation. In order for a man's mind to understand, we must make him willing to understand; he must want to understand. This is a matter of motive and motivation. If a man is not saved, it is because he has no motivation to be saved. If a man hears and understands the gospel but has no motivation to receive it, it will be useless even if he is forced to make a decision. The greatest problem facing a gospel preacher is the desire in man's heart. Once a man's heart is inclined toward the Lord, the major part of the job of preaching is done.</p><p>Proverbs 21:1 says, "The king's heart is like streams of water in the hand of Jehovah;/He turns it wherever He wishes." The most important point in preaching the gospel is to gain man's heart. Once a gospel preacher gains a man's heart, the rest is easy. We have to spend time to study and learn. We must also look to the Holy Spirit to provide us with the suitable words, that is, words with "hooks" in them. Our words have to be like hooks that draw out man's desire and gain his heart. If we can do this, our gospel preaching will be a success.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 27, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">STUDYING MAN'S HEART<br />AND LEARNING TO USE WORDS THAT HAVE "HOOKS"</h2><h2 class="head2">Creating a Feeling of Need in a Sinner</h2><p>Man's heart is deceitful above all things; it is altogether in darkness and in opposition to God. A fallen man has no heart for God whatsoever. This is the testimony of the Bible. A fallen sinner belongs totally to this world and is totally sold to sin. He has nothing good to say about God's word whatsoever. Hence, in order to preach the gospel to a sinner, our first objective should not be to make him understand the gospel. Rather, our first objective should be to help him grasp one or two of God's words. We should create a feeling of need within him. Our job is not merely to relate some gospel stories, truths, or news. The purpose of our preaching is to create a sense of need for the gospel in a sinner. We are not here merely to make him understand the gospel or to be clear about the doctrines. Even if he knows and understands the gospel in his mind, he still may not feel the need for God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO FEELINGS A SINNER MUST HAVE<br />IN ORDER TO BE SAVED</h2><p>In order for a sinner to be saved, he must have two feelings. The first is a sense of need, and the second is a sense of sin. A gospel preacher's primary work is to stir up a sense of need and a sense of sin in man. In preaching the gospel to the Samaritan woman, the Lord did not first show her the gospel or her own sin. He awoke a sense of need within her. She came to fetch water because she was thirsty. The Lord Jesus began by speaking about her outward thirst and went on to speak about her inward thirst. The Lord kept stirring up a sense of need within the woman. Eventually, she said, "Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw" (John 4:15). However, the Lord did not give her a drink immediately, but instead asked for her husband. This awakened a sense of sin within her. The Lord was wise. He pointed out her sense of need with the water and then led her to the sense of sin by referring to her husbands. In the end she was saved. Every gospel preacher should read all the gospel messages in the Bible carefully at least once. From these messages he should pick up the principles for preaching the gospel.</p><p>We know that every sinner dwells in darkness. He has no thought for God and surely does not want God. His thoughts are altogether in darkness. In order to preach the gospel to him, we must first cast light upon the darkness of his mind. We should shed light on his thoughts through God's word. In announcing the Lord's redemption to sinners, our emphasis should be to create a sense of need within them for the gospel; we have to create such a need in their heart. After they sense this need, we can explain the gospel to them in detail. In preaching the gospel, we must first cause our listeners to be dissatisfied with their present condition; we must impart a sense of hunger in them. They will want God's salvation only after a sense of need has been awakened in them.</p><p>A sinner is in total darkness as far as his relationship with God is concerned; he cannot respond to God in any way. Our job is to lead him to salvation. Therefore, in preaching the gospel we have to impart God's word into his heart with a very strong spirit. As a consequence of this, God's word will not leave; it will take root in his heart. Then we can say what we want to say. By lodging God's word within man, we have a handle with which we can pry open his heart and awaken a sense of need within him. A sinner is often saved by the kind of word we deposit within him. In preaching the gospel, we impart a thought within a sinner and then create a need within him based on this thought. In His preaching to the Samaritan woman, the Lord made a few quick turns before bringing the woman to her salvation. First, He created within her the sense of need. Next, He showed her her sins, and then she was saved. Our Lord is not only the Savior; He is a Savior who is good at saving. No other person can preach the gospel as well as the Lord did in the four Gospels.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO NECESSARY THINGS</h2><p>In learning to preach the gospel, we have to pay attention to two things. First, we have to understand God's word. We have to find words with "hooks." Second, we have to understand the sinner's heart, that is, we have to understand the condition of those whom we are preaching the gospel to. Concerning the first point, we should study in detail all the verses in the New Testament concerning the gospel. We should begin from the first chapter of Matthew. We should consider how sinners dwelt in darkness and sin, how the Lord preached the gospel to them, and how they were touched. We have to pay attention to how the Lord dealt with sinners and how men received the Lord. When we preach the gospel, we have to visualize these different kinds of sinners before our eyes and consider how we can turn them.</p><h2 class="head2">Finding Words with "Hooks"</h2><p>In preaching the gospel, we should not preach only with the aim of passing on gospel facts. Nor should we try to stir up sinners unnecessarily. Rather, we should preach according to God's word. Our words should have "hooks" that can latch on to men. The words of our preaching should have "hooks" that can catch people. Our job is not merely to convey words but to clinch men with the words. We should not be lazy to exploit these hooks. We have to remember that the effectiveness of preaching does not lie in doctrine but in the "hooks." We should study and constantly analyze the words that bring about salvation in others. If we spend enough time on this, we will discover that every person is captured by some "clincher" words. In preaching the gospel, the main thing is not to make things clear, but to use "clinchers." Every time we apply these "clinchers," men will be saved.</p><p>Gospel preachers should have the habit of asking other brothers and sisters, "With what word were you saved?" We should write these words in a notepad and study them constantly. We should also study our own story of salvation, as well as those who were saved through us. We should read all kinds of gospel stories. We should ask, "What words pricked you? What words smote you?" Write down these words. Then ask, "What words warmed you up and stirred up your desire?" Write down these words as well. Then ask, "What words prompted you to receive the Lord?" Write down these words. We will see something very interesting: The Holy Spirit likes to use words that He has used before to save men. In preaching the gospel, we have to know the words the Spirit likes to use. We have to know which words touch men, subdue men, produce a sense of need in men, prompt men to make a decision, and clinch men. We should be able to develop our own clinchers in addition to using these clinchers.</p><p>The best gospel preachers always bring their audience to a high point and then conquer them with God's word. We have to learn to use words that the Holy Spirit once used. It is very easy for the Holy Spirit to use words that He has used before. For this reason, we urgently need stories of salvation, in particular, stories of those saved through us. A study of these stories will help us find the words that the Holy Spirit has used. By what words were men subdued? We have to pay attention to these words and mark them down. We have said that there are not too many categories of people in this world. Once we know how to deal with these few categories of people, we have just about mastered everything. There is definitely the need to spend time learning the words that subdue people. We need more than one notepad to write down the words that touch men to salvation. Some people are touched in their conscience by certain words. Others are prompted to receive salvation by some other words. We have to record these words in our notepads. When we meet another person in a similar condition, we can use these words on him. In preaching the gospel, all we care for is saving men; we do not care to use too many words. We have to mark the words that the Holy Spirit has used before and try to use them again.</p><h2 class="head2">Studying a Sinner's Heart</h2><p>We must also study a sinner's heart. A man should study the Bible, but he should also study man's heart. Daily we meet many people, and they all have similarities as well as dissimilarities.</p><p>For example, we can spend time to study man's conscience. We can ask the brothers and sisters to give testimonies about their salvation. We have to know how their feelings were developed and when these feelings reached a peak. How much did they hear before their conscience started condemning them of their sins? Did they become conscious of their sins after long discourses or as a result of one or two words?</p><p>We must also study man's thoughts. Every person has his own peculiar ways of thinking; everyone thinks that he is smart. We have to ask the brothers and sisters how they received God's light the first time. How were their thoughts turned the first time? Once we know these things, we can use the same method to save those with similar conditions. God is pleased to work on similar people with similar methods. This is a law. Once we discover such a law, our preaching will become easy. When a person has a problem in his mind and we solve his problem, all other things will fall into place. For example, a girl may not want to be saved because she was under instructions from her deceased mother to reject salvation. Luke 16, however, tells us that our relatives in Hades are praying that we will be saved. If we ask the girl to read this passage, her problem will go away. Once her problem is solved, other things will fall into place.</p><p>After studying man's thoughts and will, we have to study how he makes decisions. We have to study ourselves, the brothers and sisters, and the new ones. We have to know how a man makes decisions. When we preach to others again, we have to use similar methods to prompt them to a decision. Once we have studied all these things, we will have learned most of the lessons in saving men.</p><p>A gospel preacher should have a knowledge of the right kind of experience. He should not try to correct or adjust man's sin. Instead, he should help the sinner to bring his sins to God. God is the one who does the work of removing man's sin. Our responsibility is to preach God's word and to bring men to Him. Once a man turns to God, his sins are dealt with and he is recovered.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING GOD'S WAY</h2><p>We have to learn to study God's Word. We also have to learn to study man's heart. We have to be skillful using words with "hooks," taking into account man's condition but at the same time creating a sense of need and a sense of sin within him. This is the way sustained by the Holy Spirit. The biblical way is the way that will save the most number of people, because it is God's way. On the one hand, we need the utterance. On the other hand, we need to know men. In preaching the gospel, we need "hooks" to catch men, and we need to know men's heart. We have to consider men's heart condition and come up with the right clinchers. If we do this, we will bring men to salvation easily. A gospel preacher must not only count the number of people saved but must learn from his preaching the kind of words that will catch men, the kind of words that will touch and subdue them. We have to apply ourselves to this. We have to be wise in our skill of saving men.</p><p>Today in China, the number of saved ones is less than one-sixteenth of that in India. China must take the way of the church in preaching the gospel. On the one hand, we have to pursue deeper spiritual lessons individually. On the other hand, we have to learn how to bring men to salvation and to learn to coordinate with the other brothers and sisters in this effort. We have to study all the cases of preaching the gospel in the Bible. In this way we will become more effective in our own preaching.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 28, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">CREATING A SENSE OF NEED AND A SENSE OF SIN</h2><h2 class="head2">A Sinner's Sense of Need and Sense of Sin</h2><p>Today we will consider the sense of need and the sense of sin some more. Concerning this point, Paget Wilkes has written in much detail. We will quote some of his words. [Translator's note: we are not able to find the original quotations; the following is a translation from Chinese.]</p><p>In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." The Lord called those who toil and are burdened to come for rest. This creates a sense of need in man. Some people are satisfied with their human life; they do not feel the need for salvation. We have to create in them a need, a dissatisfaction, so that they will feel the need for salvation.</p><p>Luke 4:18-19 says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord." This was the Lord's proclamation at the time He began His ministry. Here the Lord pointed out the two kinds of people His gospel is directed toward: those who have need and those who sin.</p><p>In Romans 1:29-31 Paul enumerated twenty-one kinds of sins committed by man. On the one hand, man has needs. On the other hand, he has sins. Man is ignorant of both of these things. A preacher of the gospel should create a sense of need as well as a sense of sin within men. In China it is easier to give people a sense of need than a sense of sin. For those who understand the gospel but who are not saved, our preaching should awaken a sense of sin in them because they are more prone to have a feeling of sin.</p><p>The Chinese are utilitarians. This is the reason that the Chinese do not ask for forgiveness of sins when they pray to their idols. Instead, they ask for blessing and goodwill. In preaching to the Chinese, it is very hard to invoke a sense of sin in them. Yet unless they are conscious of their sins before God, it is not easy for them to be saved. In preaching the gospel to them, we have to first plant within them a sense of their offenses against God, not just a sense of sin per se. Our preaching should not only invoke the sense of sin in general, but a sense of offense against God. If a man has only the sense of sin without a sense of offense against God, he is like a dog or a sow. Eventually, he will return to his own vomit and wallow in his own mud. Since the Sung dynasty in China, Confucianism has pointed out the struggle between reason and lust. Yet the Chinese are only aware of the sin which dwells within them; they are not aware of their offenses against God. They have no consciousness of such a thing. They can understand a teaching on deliverance from sin, but they cannot understand a teaching on forgiveness by God. If a man claims to be saved yet does not see his utter depravity and offense against God, his salvation is not firm.</p><p>Therefore to preach the gospel in China, we must not only help men have a sense of sin but must show them that they have offended the living God. Only then will they be saved. This is not easy, and we have to use all kinds of methods to support the Holy Spirit in His good works within man. Once the Holy Spirit works on man, he will have a sense that he has offended God. Although a man does not have such a sense before he is saved, he will have such a sense once the Holy Spirit operates within him.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO CREATE A SENSE OF NEED</h2><p>Let us now consider a few ways to create in man a sense of need.</p><h2 class="head2">Finding Rest</h2><p>Matthew 11:28 is a verse frequently used by gospel preachers. This verse has saved many people, both in China and in other countries. We have to use this verse to challenge men: "Are your burdens heavy? Are you toiling? Do you long for rest?" We have to make them feel the burden of the human life. We have to show them that human life is full of many burdens. Today man is anxious over many earthly things; he is full of burdens. The human life is indeed a restless life. A poor man has anxieties. A rich man has even more. A poor man is conscious of the pain of want, while a rich man worries that his money will be taken away. Those who have few possessions worry much, and those who have many possessions worry even more. The human life is indeed a suffering life, but the Lord said that He would give rest to those who come to Him.</p><p>After we speak about this verse, we can testify, saying, "Since I believed in the Lord, my burdens are gone. I now have rest." We should also ask seven or eight others to give their testimonies. This will generate a sense of need. The majority of people must have a sense of need evoked within them. This verse has saved as many people as John 3:16 has. This is a good way to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Joy and Satisfaction</h2><p>Other than rest, we can also preach the gospel by talking about the need for joy and satisfaction. We can use John 4:13-14: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life." Some people are never satisfied; they are always conscious of the vanity of life. A man can increase his wealth, but this does not increase his satisfaction. Money, children, and friends cannot satisfy man. The world is empty. When a man does not have something, he wants it. When he has it, he quickly becomes thirsty again. Before a man in this world receives the Lord, he pursues after satisfaction all the time. He can be satisfied for a few days, but very shortly he will be at the end of himself and thirsty once again. He is like a child who wants some toys before receiving them, yet tires of them once he receives them. Everything of the world can offer man only temporary satisfaction. After a man drinks of it, he will be thirsty again. He is like the Samaritan woman who was not satisfied even after having five husbands. The Lord Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again."</p><p>After saying this, we have to ask the brothers to give their testimonies; they have to speak of drinking the living water through receiving the Lord, of finding true satisfaction, and of being thirsty no longer. If we use this way to preach the gospel, we will create a need for joy and satisfaction in some. They will see that they do not have the joy that others have, and they will feel their need. When we place joy in front of those who do not have joy, the joyless ones will hunger for joy. Most Japanese are saved because they see the joy in the preachers. We have to preach the gospel this way. However, we have to drink and be satisfied first. We must receive the living water and joy from the Lord before we can create this sense of need in others.</p><h2 class="head2">On Death</h2><p>Death is also a good topic for the gospel. Death is fearful, and it is common for men to be afraid of death. Among the Chinese, every young person is afraid of death, while most old ones are not afraid of it. This is a phenomenon peculiar to the Chinese. An old person regards death as understandable and inevitable; most are not afraid of facing death. Among young people, however, the fear of death is prevalent. When preaching to young people, death is a good subject. When we are with many young people, we can preach about death. We can testify to them that Christians are not afraid to die because we have a Savior who enables us to overcome death. A sinner, however, does not have the Savior. If he dies, what will happen to him? Christians are a great testimony; they are a living testimony of men who are not afraid to face death. Church history testifies how many Christians sang and praised God at the time they were about to die. They knew that angels would come and receive them. When a believer dies, he should declare, "I am not dying. I am temporarily leaving this earthly home to meet my Lord." These are good testimonies.</p><p>Death comes to every man once (Heb. 9:27). An unbeliever may ask, "What is to become of me after I die?" No one can escape this judgment. All young people are afraid of death. They do not know what to do when death comes to them. In preaching the gospel, we can use death to create a sense of need in man. Not only should we speak of death, but also we should tell others the truth concerning the Lord Jesus' death for us. We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has tasted death for everyone (2:9). He has defeated the devil, the one who has the might of death (v. 14). Those who believe in Him are released from death; they will no longer be under the slavery of death (v. 15). They can boldly declare, "Where, O death, is your sting?" (1 Cor. 15:55). We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has removed the taste of death. This will make them sense their need for deliverance from the bondage of death.</p><h2 class="head2">The Coming Judgment</h2><p>Another way to preach the gospel is to speak about the coming judgment. In China, however, the thought of a coming judgment has been tainted with Taoist philosophy and the Buddhist religion. The Chinese mentality commonly considers that there are different gods for different religions. The Chinese speak of hell, but they regard it merely as a tool to scare people to do good. They do not consider hell as an actual future place. But the Bible tells us that it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment (Heb. 9:27). Judgment is a definite fact. In preaching this kind of gospel, we can describe the actual condition of hell to men. We can plainly explain the different kinds of judgment in the different ages in the Bible, from the present Hades through the coming tribulation to the judgment at the great white throne and ultimately to the everlasting lake of fire. All these judgments have their order and place in the Bible.</p><p>We have to believe that the Holy Spirit will speak through us as we preach the gospel of judgment. We have to boldly declare that there is a coming judgment! Everyone will die, and after death there is judgment. We can speak on Revelation 20:11-15. There we see the last judgment of God at the great white throne when the unbelievers will be cast into the lake of fire. If possible, we can go on to chapter twenty-one and compare it to chapter twenty. This will stir up men's desire to escape judgment and to receive eternal life. The key to preaching is to believe that the Holy Spirit will speak to men as we speak. God has spoken. Therefore, we can speak. We do not have to be shy. This is also a very good way. Do not be afraid to preach about judgment or eternal punishment. Many people are saved through hearing about judgment. If we cooperate with the Holy Spirit, others will feel the need for salvation when they hear a word on judgment.</p><h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Human Life</h2><p>The meaning of human life is also a subject for the gospel. Some people think that human life is a riddle. They do not know the meaning of human life. Does man exist only for eating, drinking, and sleeping? Some ask this question. We can preach the gospel from this angle. We can tell others that a man lives a meaningless life if he only knows to eat, drink, and sleep. Man's existence is only meaningful after he knows God and knows God's intention in creating man. We have to tell him the biblical record of God's creation, man's fall, and God salvation for man. If a man does not have salvation, he does not have a center; he does not have meaning to his human life. God created the heavens, the earth, and man for Himself. He is the center of everything, and in particular, the center of man. If a man turns away from God, he becomes a mere eating and sleeping machine. Once a man has God, however, he has meaning and purpose to his human life. He will no longer feel the vanity of this life.</p><p>The above five subjects define man's greatest needs. Most people have these five needs. If we can preach these five kinds of gospel, we can meet the need of almost everyone. We have to learn how to present one of these five kinds of things to men, showing them their needs and showing them the way to satisfy their needs. We know these needs, but sinners do not. We should preach what we know to those who do not know.</p><p>The worst thing that a preacher can do is to speak about doctrines without creating a sense of need in others. Reason cannot bring a man to tears. Doctrines cannot prick man's heart. Philosophy cannot kindle the fire within man. Excitement cannot save him. Only creating a sense of need will cause man to readily receive the gospel. It matters little whether or not doctrines are preached well. We should be satisfied as long as men are saved. The thought of giving a good message is a great temptation to a gospel preacher. A doctor does not need to learn to prescribe nice medicine; he needs to heal patients. The greatest mistake that we can commit is to preach a good message for the sake of saving our face, while men's souls remain unsaved.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO CREATE IN MAN A SENSE OF SIN</h2><p>Another way to preach the gospel is to create a sense of sin in man. We need to consider a few ways to preach about this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Power of Sin</h2><p>Man's consciousness of sin grows; it develops gradually from a shallow state to an acute state. In order for our preaching to create a sense of sin in an unbeliever, we have to show him the power of sin. It is very easy to show an unbeliever the power of sin. We should ask the following questions: "Do you ever make a resolution to be good? Does a student ever make a resolution to study well? Does a child ever make a resolution to not provoke his parents to anger? Does a wife ever make a resolution to be one with her husband? The will is present in them, but the power to do it is not (Rom. 7:18)." We can ask young people who are addicted to gambling, opium, cigarettes, or alcohol if they want to be free from their habits. We have to show them that there is a power behind these things that binds them. The more a man tries to free himself from this power, the more bound he becomes. This is like a high jump athlete; the higher he tries to jump, the more he feels the force of gravity. The more a person tries to stop lying, the more he realizes the impossibility of stopping. The more a man resolves to not lose his temper, the more he realizes how hard this is. The more a person tries to not sin, the more he discovers the power of sin. The more he wants to be free from sin, the more he sins. In this way he discovers how great the power of sin is. It is exceedingly hard to do good, yet it is exceedingly easy to sin. However, if a man has the life of Christ, he receives a power to do good and a power to overcome sin. Many people are saved through this kind of preaching. Once a man knows the power of sin, he develops a consciousness of sin and senses the need for salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Contagiousness of Sin</h2><p>Many people have a strong sense of social responsibility. They are not conscious of their own sins, but they react strongly to others' sins. They abhor the sins of others. We have to tell them that when they sin, they damage those who are around them, in particular, their children. Every generation follows the pattern of the generation that precedes it. If we sin, the next generation will follow. If we smoke opium, our children will be addicted to opium. If we play mahjong, our children will learn to play mahjong. If we drink, our children will also drink. By not suppressing our own sense of sin, we pass this sin on to our children. If we are greedy for money or lose our temper easily, others, especially our children, will easily follow in the same thing. Although not many people will respond to this kind of preaching, some will. We can tell them that sin is contagious. It is especially contagious to our children. We can destroy them by our contagion.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Result of Sin</h2><p>The one who is damaged the most by sin is the sinner himself. Sin has fruit. The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23a). Proverbs 8:36 says that those who sin against the Lord wrong their own soul. When a man sins, he reaps the fruit of sin to himself. Galatians 6:8 says that he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh. We should not think that we can get away with sin without reaping some fruit. The wages of sin is death. This verse has saved many people. Sin will reap the fruit of sin for the sinner. The result of sin will always fall back on the sinner himself. Some people have to be brought to this realization before they see the evil of sin. In describing this fact, we have to read the list of sins spoken of in Romans 1:29-31 and explain these sins one by one. This is like painting a portrait of a person; we have to bring out the true likeness of the man. Everyone likes to see a picture of himself. A gospel preacher has to sketch a picture of man and show him his true likeness. When we describe a man's sins one by one, the Holy Spirit will shine on him and convict him of his sins. Quite a number of people become conscious of their sins through this kind of speaking. If we can preach in this way, others will know that they are short. In order to speak about sin, however, we must live in God's presence and be under the light ourselves. We must receive the shining ourselves before we can enlighten others. Once a man sees the dominion sin has over him, his heart will turn, and he will seek for the Savior.</p><h2 class="head2">Transgressing God's Law</h2><p>A man may feel that pride is his sin, but he may not feel that his pride is a transgression against God. To an ordinary man, sinning is one thing and transgressing against God is another. But for a Christian, sinning and transgressing against God are the same thing. When we sin against a brother, we are transgressing against God. Unbelievers usually think that sinning has nothing to do with transgressing against God. The Bible shows us that David committed the sin of adultery and murder, but he realized that he had transgressed against God Himself. He considered himself not only to have sinned but to have transgressed against God (Psa. 51:4). If a man only has the sense of sin without a realization that he is transgressing against God, he is not qualified to be called a Christian. The Lord is above everything; every authority and human relationship is derived from Him. If I sin against another person, I am sinning against God. Suppose I have ten dogs and ten sheep, and the dogs bite the sheep and kill them. These dogs have not only sinned against the sheep but also against me. Those who do not know God only consider sin to be sin; they do not know that it is a transgression against God. Many Christians are only aware of sin; they are not aware of their transgression against God. These Christians have a problem with their salvation experience. The Chinese do not have much realization of this fact. For this reason, we have to ask God to do a deeper work. When a sinner has a deep consciousness of sin, he realizes that sin is not only sin but a transgression against God. In preaching the gospel, we have to bring the listeners to realize that they have not only sinned but that they also have transgressed against God through their sins. This is a crucial factor in our preaching.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Offense against God Himself</h2><p>When a man sins, he has not only transgressed God's law but has offended God Himself. The last point tells us that in sinning a man transgresses against God's law and ordinance. Here we are saying that when a man sins, he offends God Himself; he has offended God's heart. The last point deals with transgression against the outward righteous law of God. This point deals with offense against the inward heart of God. Luke 15 says that the prodigal was sinning in a far country. When he came to himself, he did not just say that he had sinned. He wanted to turn back to his father and tell him that he had sinned against heaven as well as before him (v. 18). Sinning against him means offending his father and breaking his heart. He had rejected his father's love, protection, and tears. The previous point deals with transgression against God's law, administration, and ordination. This point deals with offenses against God Himself, His love, His protection, and His grace. The greatest sin is for man to turn away from God.</p><p>The story of the prodigal son is one of the best stories in the Bible. It has saved many people. The prodigal did not say how many sins he had committed. He only intended to tell his father that he had sinned before him. The prodigal did not become prodigal through his sins. The day that he left his father he became a prodigal son. "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son..." (John 3:16). It seems as if God loves the world more than He loves His only begotten Son. As far as love is concerned, God is the father of the whole world. It appears that God's relationship with the world exceeds His relationship with His own Son. Does not the world break the heavenly Father's heart when it sins? Some people think that God is reluctant to save men and wants sinners to die and perish. Such ones offend God's love; they commit the greatest of all sins. This is a misunderstanding of God's heart. There was once an old widow who was childless. She intended to give all her wealth to her nephew. The nephew did not know about this. He coveted her wealth and killed her. When he saw her will and discovered that all her possessions had been willed to him, he became very remorseful. He had not only committed murder but had murdered the one who loved him. This is the greatest of all sins. For a man to reject the Savior is the greatest sin in the eyes of God because this amounts to a denial of His love. God loves the world. This is the reason He gave His only begotten Son to us. If we do not accept Him, we  reject God's provision and love. This constitutes the greatest sin.</p><h2 class="head1">APPLICATION</h2><p>In preaching the gospel we just need to choose one of the ten preceding subjects. This will be sufficient to bring a sinner to the Lord and to get him saved. However, if we use any one of the first eight subjects, we have to supplement it with the ninth or tenth point. This will bring about a complete salvation. In other words, no matter which way a sinner takes, he has to see that he has transgressed against God's law and has offended God Himself. The Holy Spirit operates in some people immediately after they are touched and shows them that they have offended God. If the Holy Spirit has not yet done this work, we should speak to them until they have this realization. We should show them that they have offended God. Otherwise, sooner or later they will have problems with their own salvation.</p><p>The work of an evangelist is to create a sense of these ten needs in man and then to show him the way of salvation. If we learn our lessons well, we will bring many to salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 30, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">THINGS THAT AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD DO</h2><p>How much truth should an awakened sinner understand, and what should he do in order to receive salvation? Today we will consider these two questions.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AMOUNT OF TRUTH<br />AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD KNOW</h2><h2 class="head2">The Gift of God</h2><p>The first thing we should do after a sinner is awakened is to show him the gift of God. John 4:10 says, "If you knew the gift of God...you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water." What is the gift of God? Verse 14 tells us that the living water satisfies. When a person is touched by our preaching, we can bring him to salvation by just giving him a little push to take a further step. If we drag on with our preaching, however, we may not be able to push him to the Lord. This is something that offends the Lord. For example, some people are afraid of the coming judgment. We should immediately tell them how they can escape it. If we show them Matthew 11:28 instead, telling them that all those who are burdened can come to Him for rest, we are doing a foolish thing even though we are relating Scriptures to them. If a man is awakened to the vanity of the world, it is foolish to ramble on about the coming judgment. Another sinner may feel the bondage and power of sin. If we ignore this and talk to him about the vanity of the world, we are being equally foolish.</p><p>An evangelist should know a sinner's needs. Whatever the sinner is thinking, we should meet his needs right away. We should not lead him around in circles. In preaching the gospel, we do not dictate the kind of problems a sinner should have. Rather, we have to observe the problem that he actually has and then try to solve the problem. It is most offensive to the Lord for a gospel preacher to subjectively decide others' needs and problems. A subjective man cannot save anyone. In preaching the gospel, we have to learn to be objective. We have to learn to touch man's inner feelings. Although we can classify sinners into categories, every case is different in reality. We have to dispense God's gift to man. Man needs His gift. We should never force down others' throats what they do not need. We have to give to them what they are awakened to and what they really need.</p><p>We must also note that man's natural thoughts are very legal and judicial. He thinks that God cannot give anything for free, that man must do something and behave in certain ways before he can please God and earn His gift. Man thinks that he must pay something in order to have joy. God's salvation, however, is free; it is a gift. The Lord can meet the specific needs of each person. His gift can satisfy man's every need.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word of God</h2><p>After a man knows the gift of God, we have to give him a word from God. A man may believe in a word that we have spoken to him, but he cannot remain in this kind of faith. Whether we are speaking from the podium or in private, we have to point out God's Word to our listener. We have to give him a clear verse. There is no need to give him too many verses. All that is needed is to open the necessary verse to him and to let him read it. We have to explain it clearly to him, and we have to tell him that this is the gift of God. Let him read it over and over again, and let him feel that this is the word that will meet his need.</p><p>It is not enough for a sinner just to know God's gift. We have to bring him to God and let him know that God is his Father. We can show him Matthew 7:11: "How much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!" Of course, none of us believe in the teaching of the universal fatherhood of God. However, we can still tell the sinner that God is a Father to the sinner. As far as we are concerned, we are not His children until He begets us, but as far as God's love is concerned, God treats all human beings like His own children, whether or not they are saved. God gave His only begotten Son to all sinners based on His fatherly love. It is not a problem for God to be man's Father. The problem is on the part of the sinner. We will speak about this problem later. If we are willing to ask of Him, He will grant us His gift. In preaching the gospel to sinners, we can tell them that God loves the world like His own children. The only thing He does not have with them is a life-relationship. We can apply this analogy, because the Lord Jesus once did it as well (Luke 15:11-24).</p><p>By giving the sinner a word from God, we bring him to a direct touch with God. It is a hard thing to ask a sinner to pray. As gospel preachers, we should always lead a sinner to God; we should always lead him to pray to the Father in heaven. We can read Matthew 7:11 to a sinner. After a sinner understands our preaching, we should consummate the work by bringing him to touch God. We should point out Matthew 7:11 to the sinner and tell him that no father would hold back good things from his sons. God is like our earthly father; He is willing to give us good things freely. Then we have to ask him to pray. Praying a short prayer for five minutes is more effective than listening to a long sermon for five hours. In preaching the gospel, we have to show the sinners through God's word that He is a God who dispenses gifts. He is eager to dispense His grace to man.</p><h2 class="head2">The Hindrance of Sin</h2><p>On God's side there is no problem being man's Father; the problem is on the sinner's side. God is eager to dispense His grace to the world, but He is held back by man's sin. Sin hinders God from dispensing His grace to man. Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear. / But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear." John 9:31 says, "We know that God does not hear sinners." We should read these verses to a sinner. This is the third step.</p><p>We should not preach a gospel which tries to bring men to God without the need of prayer. I am afraid that there is no such gospel. We must help a sinner to make a turn to God. God is willing to dispense His gift to man, and He will always dispense His gift to man. Man's sinfulness, however, prevents God from answering his prayer and petition. This brings us one step further, from a sense of need to a sense of sin. In preaching the gospel, we should let the sinner see God's gift. After this we should let him see what kind of God He is, and then let him see his own sins. As long as we can get a person to come to God, the question of His existence will not pose a problem. Bringing a person to God is easier than trying to prove His existence. After we have done this, we should awaken him to a sense of sin. After he becomes conscious of his own sin, we have reached the fourth step.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>The fourth step is to show the sinner the cross of the Lord Jesus. Only the cross can solve the problem of man's sin. We can ask a sinner to read Hebrews 9:27-28, 1 Peter 2:24, and 3:18. We only need to read these few passages with him. We do not have to speak too much about the doctrine of the cross. All we need is to let a sinner know that the Lord Jesus has borne our sins. This simple preaching is all that is needed. As preachers of the gospel, we must not interrupt our own message. We should never try to be omniscient or try to explain everything clearly. We only have to speak a little; we should not lead the listeners into detours. Rather, we should use simple words and use our own testimony.</p><p>Concerning the Lord's crucifixion for us, we can consider a few types in the Bible. The first is the Lord Jesus as the ark. God's judgment fell on Him, and we who are in Him are spared from judgment. The second is the Lord Jesus as the Lamb. He was slain for our sins and transgressions, and His blood was shed for our redemption. The third is the Lord Jesus as the brass serpent being hung on the pole for sinners. As soon as sinners look up to Him, they are saved. The Lord's crucifixion is also like the offering of the sacrifices in the Old Testament. He is the Lamb of God, sacrificing Himself for our redemption. In preaching the gospel, we only need to let sinners know the simple fact of the Lord's crucifixion. As long as they believe, they will be saved by the redemption of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">KEYS TO PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>The above four steps constitute a direct way to preach to the awakened sinners. Through these four steps, we can easily bring them to God. These are basic truths; they are also simple truths. We want to bring men to salvation with the least amount of truth. We want them to know these four things because the thoughts of sinners are totally in darkness. Their mind is not open to God, their emotion does not desire God, and there is no room in their judgment for God. We have to use the above four steps to lead them to a proper desire and decision. This is what we called "clinchers" in the earlier chapters. The goal of our preaching is to create a desire for God within sinners.</p><p>Mr. Wilkes said that we have to pray for the sinners, believe for them, and even receive for them. This is true. He meant that we have to feel the sins of the sinners; we have to feel as if their sins are our sins, and that together we have offended the Lord and rejected Him. We should join ourselves to their confession and even to their believing. When they believe, we believe. As they repent, we repent. The two are joined as one. When we deny the world, we are denying the world with and for them. When we accept the Lord, we are accepting Him with and for them. We should join them in prayer, in believing, and in receiving. In this way, sinners will be brought to the Lord easily.</p><p>A gospel preacher must be burning in his heart. A cold person cannot save others. For this reason, we must first be kindled ourselves with fire before we can kindle others with the same fire. Only one who identifies himself with those who are about to be saved and feels the same as they do can bring about their salvation.</p><p>Next, we have to preach a gospel that speaks of things that are here with us today. We should not preach a gospel that merely speaks of things that happened two thousand years ago. God's gospel is like the manna; it must be fresh and living every day.</p><p>Third, we have to grind ourselves into fine powder before we can touch others' feelings in a tender way. We have to echo the sinners' feelings. We have to bear the sinners on our shoulder and carry them to salvation. Our words have to be clinchers, but even more our very person has to be a clincher. A gospel preacher has to possess a certain rare power, a power that will electrify others. He has to be an "electric conductor,"  and he has to join himself to sinners and pass on this "electricity" to them. We have to be receivers and conductors, those who can pass electricity on to others at will. We have to waste our lives before we can do the work of soul saving. Paul was one who gave up everything for the gospel's sake. He was willing to spend and be spent for others' souls (2 Cor. 12:15). He was not only good at preaching; he was able to waste himself on behalf of others. Paul is a good example to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS THAT AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD DO</h2><p>When we reach this point, a sinner will ask, "What should I do to be saved?" Here are also four things.</p><h2 class="head2">Confess</h2><p>The first thing we should do is to tell an awakened sinner to confess his sins. First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Although this verse is for Christians, in principle anyone who confesses his sins to God will receive His forgiveness. We must be clear about confession. Confession means to stand on God's side and to acknowledge sin as sin. Many people only plead for forgiveness without making any confession. For example, many people say to God, "I am proud. I am envious. I am lustful. I hate others." They only ask God to forgive them, but they do not acknowledge these as sins. The fact of the matter is that as soon as a sinner acknowledges a sin to be sin, God will forgive him. Confessing to God means acknowledging before Him that a sin is sin indeed. We have to lead sinners not only to pray for forgiveness but to confess sin as sin.</p><p>Everyone has a few particular sins of his own. He does not commit all sins in a general way. For this reason, confession means to confess the few particular sins that one has. Confession cannot be general. One has to confess his sins in a specific way. We should not say to God, "I am proud. I am envious. Please forgive me." Rather, we should confess, saying, "I am proud, and this is sin. I am envious, and this is sin." If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins.</p><p>The worst thing that an evangelist can do is to invite a sinner to the feast but fail to introduce him to the Host. Our purpose is not to make others nod at our doctrines, but to touch God. After they have understood the four points spoken of above, we should lead them to kneel before the Lord and pray. Once a man confesses his sins, he stands on God's side and condemns sin as sin. If he does not confess his sins, he is still standing on the side of sin. We have to bend the stiffened knees; we have to lead him to kneel down to pray. We should not ask him to just ask for forgiveness; we have to make him confess first and then ask for forgiveness. A great advantage of this confession is that the confessor will never forget what he has done. Once he prays this way, he will no longer be able to escape. This confession will count in the eyes of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Read God's Word</h2><p>After a man confesses his sin, we have to give him God's word. This will establish him in the faith. If a man does not believe in his heart, his prayer and confession will be useless. A sinner's body does not play any part in his salvation and regeneration. His spirit is dead. His understanding is darkened, his emotion is void of aspirations, and his will is definitely antagonistic. How can such a person believe? First, something outside of him has to get into him. We have to deposit something into him, something that will not come out once it gets into him&mdash;the word of God. Only God's word works. No doctrine will work, and no casual remark will work. Only God's word works. Only His word will enter and operate within man. Hence, the second thing to do with an awakened sinner is to let him read the Bible. Let him read God's Word over and over again, until this word gets into him. This is what Romans 10:14 and 17 mean when they say that seeking comes from believing, believing comes from hearing, and hearing from the word of Christ. James 1:21 says that God's implanted word can save a sinner's soul. Second Peter 1:4 says that a man partakes of God's nature through the promises in His word. Acts 2:41 says that men were saved through receiving God's word, the word which Peter preached at Pentecost.</p><p>All of God's work is included in His word. When a man receives God's word, he receives God's work. The content of God's word is His work. Man does not touch God's work directly; he touches God's word, and through His word he touches His work. Gospel preachers must try to memorize many verses concerning God's salvation. In preaching the gospel, we should announce God's Word sentence by sentence until sinners are fully clear. In this way they will never forget God's word.</p><p>We have to make others trust in God's word. They have to rest on God's word, to the extent that they treat God's word as a pillow. Such a pillow supports their head all the time even after they are saved.</p><h2 class="head2">Believe in the Heart</h2><p>After a man confesses his sins and reads God's Word, he has to believe in his heart. What is the difference between confessing and believing? Confession is an act. After confession there is God's Word. Believing is trusting that God has done what He said He would do in His Word. In 1 John 1:9 a sinner first confesses his sins&mdash;this is an act. Faith means that a sinner believes that God has acted according to His word and has forgiven our sins through the blood of His Son and has washed away our unrighteousnesses. This is all that is needed. Believing is not waiting for something to happen. It is having a living faith toward God's Word. A living faith happens instantaneously, while the knowledge of the assurance of salvation comes afterwards. God's Word says that he who believes has eternal life. As soon as we believe, we have eternal life. The faith that we are speaking of here is not a general faith in the work that the Lord has accomplished but a faith that turns God's Word into accomplished facts immediately. As soon as one believes, he has the facts. We have to make sure that the new ones take this step immediately. We have to let them know that they have received eternal life right then and there.</p><h2 class="head2">Confess with the Mouth</h2><p>The last step is to confess with the mouth. The best way to test if a man has believed is to ask him to confess the Lord in public. We can read Romans 10:9-10 and 13 to him, which says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation....For `whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'" Many people are not sure about their salvation because they have not confessed with their mouth. Once a man confesses with his mouth, he can be sure of his salvation. This is like mixing concrete; as soon as water is added, the concrete sets. After a man believes, we have to provide him an opportunity to immediately confess with his mouth. Many people who are not clear about their salvation become clear once they open their mouth to confess.</p><p>An awakened sinner should do the above four things. A sinner only needs to believe in God's word and confess with his mouth, then his spirit will be made alive. God will put His Spirit within the spirit of those who believe in Him. Once a sinner takes the step of faith, God gives him a new heart. The result of this believing is a new life, which a man receives from God. He is saved and born again.</p><p>We have to spend much time on these matters. A sloppy person will not do a good job in leading men to salvation. We have to study these matters carefully. We must not speak lightly or quote a verse lightly. We have to exercise care in every step we take. We should not only aim at saving men in a general way through our preaching but should aim at a gospel that produces high quality results. I hope that we can all learn these lessons properly and thoroughly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 31, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">BOTH THE CONDITION OF SALVATION<br />AND THE RESULT OF SALVATION<br />BEING ACCOMPLISHED BY GOD</h2><h2 class="head2">The Condition and the Result<br />of Salvation Being One</h2><p>Today we will consider the condition and result of salvation. The common concept is that these two things are very different, that is, that we are responsible for the condition of salvation while God is responsible for the result of salvation. We cannot find one example in this world in which the means and the goal are the same. We know that there are conditions that lead to salvation. For example, repentance is a condition. Forgiveness, however, is a result. Similarly, believing is a condition, while salvation is a result. A man must know the Lord before he can have life. Knowing the Lord is a condition, while having life is a result. There is even a difference between salvation itself and the receiving of life. Salvation is a condition for receiving life, while loving the Lord is a result of having this life. A man must be saved before he can be part of God's people, and he must be part of God's people before he is qualified to live the life of a child of God. Hence, being part of God's people is a condition, while living the life of a child of God is the result. A man must be saved before he can be free from the sins of the flesh. Here salvation is the condition and freedom from sin is the result.</p><p>We all think that salvation is one thing, the condition of salvation is another thing, and the result of salvation is yet a third thing. But the Bible speaks of the condition and result of salvation in a mixed-up way; there is no way to separate the two. In preaching the gospel, it is very hard to explain the condition for salvation and the result of salvation as if they were separate items. It is foolish to try to break them down and analyze them as two separate things. The Lord has no intention of making a clear separation between the condition and the result of salvation. This is not a confusion but a most glorious acknowledgment of fact. This prompts us to greater worship. The condition of salvation is the same as the result of salvation, and the result of salvation is the same as the condition of salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">CLEAR PROOFS IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>We can find a few proofs of this in the Bible. Let us first read Luke 18 and 19. In Luke 18:18-27 a young ruler came to the Lord Jesus and asked, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" The young ruler wanted eternal life, and he came to ask about the condition for receiving it. He wanted to know what he first needed to do to receive eternal life. The Lord Jesus told him to keep all the commandments. The young man responded readily, "All these things I have kept from my youth." The Lord Jesus then told him to sell his all and give to the poor, and then to follow Him. That is the way to inherit eternal life. At this word, the young ruler went away in sorrow because he could not do it. When the Lord saw him turning away, he said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God." In saying this, the Lord equated receiving eternal life with entering God's kingdom. When the disciples heard this, they said, "Then who can be saved?" They put all three things&mdash;inheriting eternal life, entering God's kingdom, and being saved&mdash;together. With God, all three things are possible. These three things&mdash;salvation, receiving eternal life, and entering God's kingdom&mdash;are results. The one condition is to sell everything and to follow the Lord.</p><p>Moving on to Luke 19:1-10, there is the story of Zaccheus's salvation. As soon as he was saved, he declared that he would give half of his possessions to the poor and restore four times what he had taken from others by false accusation. In chapter eighteen there is a young, moral ruler. In chapter nineteen there is a middle-aged, immoral tax collector. What is seen as a condition for salvation in chapter eighteen becomes a result of salvation in chapter nineteen. In chapter eighteen the condition for salvation is selling one's possessions. But in chapter nineteen, giving up of one's possessions becomes the result of salvation and even salvation itself. Luke 18 and 19 are completely opposite. We know that if something is a condition, it requires work on our part, and that if it is a result, it is God's work. The Lord said that the condition for entering God's kingdom is to sell everything, but He also said that what is impossible with man is possible with God. This means that we cannot sell everything by ourselves; God has to be the One who does this for us. Here we see that the condition of salvation is also salvation itself. We think that the condition is fulfilled by us while the result is accomplished by God. But the Lord said that even the condition of salvation is accomplished by God Himself. If salvation depends on our work, no one will be saved. The Lord said that what is impossible with man is possible with God. This incorporates the condition for salvation into salvation itself. In other words, God does everything. This does not say that what is possible with man should be done by man, and what is impossible with man should be taken up by God. Rather, it says that man does not have to do anything; God does everything.</p><p>Read Acts 5:31-32 again: "This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him." Here it clearly says that forgiveness and repentance are both given by God. Man has a wrong concept; he thinks that repentance is something he does, while forgiveness is something God gives. The Bible, however, says that both repentance and forgiveness are given to us by God. He has left nothing for man to do. In preaching the gospel, if someone finds it hard to repent, we can speak of repentance and forgiveness as being one thing. We can tell him that God has given both repentance and forgiveness as gifts. Originally, repentance is a condition for forgiveness. It is good if the Holy Spirit gives man repentance, but if a man cannot repent, we can incorporate repentance under the subject of forgiveness. According to this verse, God gives both things at the same time. He gives repentance at the same time that He gives forgiveness.</p><p>Second Peter 1:1 says, "Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ." Here it says that we have received a faith that is equal to that possessed by other Christians. The entire Bible tells us that the condition for salvation is faith. Here, however, it does not say that we offer our faith to God, but that God offers faith to us. Faith is one of the gifts of God; it is something that we have received from Him. A man is able to believe through the faith he has received from the Holy Spirit. In preaching the gospel, we say that a man must believe before he can be saved. If he cannot believe, however, it is still all right, because faith is an item included in our salvation.</p><p>In Luke 10:25-37 a lawyer asked the Lord, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" The lawyer wanted to know the condition for inheriting eternal life. The Lord told him that to inherit eternal life, he had to love his God and love his neighbor as himself. Here we see that love is a condition for salvation. The lawyer followed this by asking another question: "Who is my neighbor?" The Lord went on with a story in verses 30 through 35, after which He asked, "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?" The Lord intended to show that the lawyer was the very one who had fallen into the hands of the robbers, and that his neighbor, the good Samaritan, was the Lord Jesus Himself. John 4:9 indicates that Samaritans and Jews did not communicate with each other; they had nothing to do with one another. This means that our Lord has no share in the communications of this world. In John 8:48-49 the Jews reviled the Lord as a Samaritan and a demon-possessed person. The Lord denied that He was demon possessed, but He did not deny that He was a Samaritan. This shows us clearly that the good Samaritan refers to the Lord Jesus Himself.</p><p>Luke 10:25-37 is clearly divided into two sections. Verses 25 through 28 are the first section, and verses 29 through 37 are the second section. Loving one's neighbor in order to inherit eternal life is in the first section. The second section tells us that the Savior is the neighbor. He is the One who first loved the sinner. It seems as if inheriting eternal life and loving one's neighbor are all mixed up. Yet this is a glorious fact! On the one hand, when we love Him, we inherit eternal life. On the other hand, He is the One who has loved us and given us eternal life. He must first love us and save us before we can love Him. We cannot love the Lord. Any love that we have towards Him has to come from Him. Eternal life is from Him; so is our love for Him. Salvation is a gift from Him; so is the condition of salvation. Man only needs to believe and receive. Everything is from God. This is the reason that those who have faith can come, and those who do not have faith can also come. Those who want salvation can come, and those who do not want salvation can also come. The Lord is the One who has done everything.</p><p>Read the story in Luke 7:36-48 again. At the end of verse 47, the Lord told Simon that those who are forgiven much love much, and those who are forgiven little love little. This word shows that forgiving comes first and love comes after. It is not that those who love much are forgiven much, but that those who are forgiven much love much. In verse 48 the Lord Jesus told the woman, "Your sins are forgiven." This means that the woman first loved the Lord and then was forgiven. This puts the result of salvation as a condition of salvation. Originally, forgiveness of debt is the content of salvation, while loving the Lord is the result of it. Here, however, the Lord Jesus turns the two around. He tells us that because the woman loved much, all her sins were forgiven. Again the condition for salvation and the result of salvation are mixed up. The forgiving One is the Lord, and the One who caused the woman to love is also the Lord. Salvation is from the Lord, and so is the result of salvation. Here we do not find an order of precedence between the condition for salvation and the result of salvation.</p><p>From the very beginning to the very end, God is the One who accomplishes everything. This is the gospel. God has not only accomplished the work of salvation for us at Golgotha, but He is accomplishing this salvation within us. Both our objective salvation and our subjective salvation are accomplished by the Lord. Luke 8:15 says, "That which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance." We do not have a noble and good heart. Such a heart is made by God (Eccl. 7:29). A sinner cannot be saved unless he first has a noble and good heart. Thank the Lord that He has given us a noble and good heart to receive salvation. God has demands, but He is the One who works to meet the demands. This is the gospel.</p><p>John 17:3 says, "This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ." However, Matthew 11:27 says, "No one fully knows the Son except the Father." For a man to know Jesus Christ, he must first have the revelation of the Father. A man must come to the Son to receive life, but only those to whom the Father has chosen to reveal Himself will know the Son, and only those who know the Son will come to the Lord. Those who come to Him will have life. Do we know the Lord and then come to Him, or do we come to Him and then know Him? Do we come to the Lord to receive eternal life, or do we receive eternal life to come to the Lord? Thank the Lord both are right. All are works of God. Man cannot specify any condition. God has combined the condition and the result into the same thing.</p><p>In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says, "I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep." The Lord's sheep are those who have believed into Him. But verse 26 says, "But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep." This proves that His sheep are those who believe in Him. Those who believe are the Lord's sheep, and the Lord lays down His life for them. We usually say that we believe in the Lord because He has first died for us. Yet John 10:26 says that one does not believe because he is not of His sheep. This means that the Lord's sheep are those who believe in Him and that He has laid down His life for such sheep. This turns things around. It seems as if the Lord is saying that we have to believe in Him first before He will die for us. Of course, we have never heard such a gospel. But this is indeed the case with the Lord. This means that our Lord is God; He is not governed by any time sequence. He is the One who accomplishes the believing, and He is the One who has laid down His life for us. Everything is of Him.</p><p>In Acts 18 Paul wanted to remain in Corinth for the gospel. That night the Lord Jesus appeared to him, saying, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent...because I have many people in this city" (vv. 9-10). Does a man first believe and then become part of God's people, or does a man become part of His people first and then believe? As soon as we introduce the concept of time, we have a problem. Thank God that He is beyond time. We are bound by time, and therefore with us there is the matter of time sequence. But with God there is no time sequence; He is not bound by time. This is the reason a condition can be a result at the same time. Both things are accomplished by God. Outwardly speaking, it seems as if they are accomplished by man. Actually, they are all accomplished by God's grace. It is God who operates in us to receive salvation and to work for Him. Man can do nothing.</p><p>Romans 9:23 says that we are "vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory." We become a vessel, and then we receive His glory. Glory is with God. He created a vessel and filled this vessel with His glory. God has made us a vessel prepared unto glory, and then He fills us with this glory. We do not receive this glory by ourselves. We receive it because God has done everything. We have done nothing. Hallelujah! God has made us a vessel unto glory.</p><h2 class="head1">COMING TO JESUS JUST AS WE ARE</h2><p>Hence, everyone can come to the Lord just as he is. The Lord is a friend of sinners. As long as a man opens his heart wide to Him, God will save him. Man's prayer may be wrong, but the One who listens to his prayer is never wrong. All that a man needs is a little desire to turn to God. Man's requests may be wrong, but God's answer is never wrong. In addition, the Holy Spirit has come, and wherever man prays, He operates. There is no place that the Holy Spirit cannot reach. As long as there is a crack within man's heart, the Holy Spirit can perform His work. Man may be lacking in knowledge, but as soon as he touches the Lord, everything is done. Furthermore, God has blended the condition of the gospel with the result of the gospel. Man does not have to do anything. He only needs to come to God. God's work will bring him to his salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO LESSONS</h2><p>There are two sides of the gospel. On the one hand there are the techniques of the gospel. On the other hand, there is the content of the gospel. If we are well-trained in both areas, we will save many people. Anytime we find a person who is seeking and looking for more truth, we should give him a proper and clear exposition of the truth. If we find a person who is looking for the simple gospel, however, we should simply lead him to the simple and genuine gospel. We have to pay equal emphasis to learning both lessons.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(9)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: September 2, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO<br />THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Question: What should we do when we encounter a person who does not want to accept salvation readily? Is there a difference between preaching the gospel on the podium and preaching to individuals in private?</p><p>Answer: The most important lesson in preaching the gospel is to learn to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. We should follow the Holy Spirit and work as He works. The most important thing is not to act contrary to the Holy Spirit. In saving men we should not try to save only those who are easy to work on. We should also try to save those who are hard to work on. By working on the hard ones, we can learn many lessons. If we can save one who is hard, we can save others who are hard later.</p><p>Preaching in private should be the same as preaching in public, but we have to bring the sinners to the Lord. We must always bring them to their knees to pray. Once a person prays, he is brought to the Lord.</p><p>Question: Can we concentrate on only one of the five ways spoken of earlier?</p><p>Answer: Actually there are six ways to preach the gospel. The sixth way is through a living faith. This last one supplements and complements the first five ways. We can use the first five ways to preach the gospel, but in the end we have to say, "The Lord is a friend of sinners. You have to come just as you are." We should encourage those who have faith to come and encourage those who do not have faith to come as well. Those who repent can come, and those who cannot repent can come as well. Anyone can come to the Lord for help because He is a friend of sinners. As long as a sinner exercises faith to touch the Lord, he receives grace, and once the Lord grants grace to a man, he is saved.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A FEW THINGS THAT A WORKER<br />OF THE LORD SHOULD REMEMBER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: July 23, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">HIS VOICE</h2><p>The main thing a worker of the Lord has to do is to speak. For this reason he has to pay much attention to his voice. Some people have a good voice by birth. Others are just the opposite. The voice we have by birth is not the main factor; the main thing we need is training. There are two basic things to remember about our voice during our speaking. First, we have to relax our tongue. Second, we should try not to shout with the throat very much, but instead we should try to push our words out from the deeper part of our abdomen.</p><p>Ordinarily, when we relax our tongue, we cannot raise our voice at the same time. Under such circumstances, it becomes hard to speak effectively. In order to relax the tongue, we have to relax the muscles of our entire body as well. Before we speak, we have to remind ourselves that we should relax all our muscles. Our tongue should be properly situated in between the teeth. We can only relax our tongue if our whole body is relaxed, and only then can we speak properly. Next, when we speak, our body has to act like an accordion; we have to press the air out from our abdomen, not just speak from the throat. If our abdominal muscles ache after we speak, we are doing the right thing. But if we find that our throat hurts after we speak, we are doing the wrong thing. After we speak, we should rinse our throat with disinfectant. This will prevent inflammation in the throat.</p><h2 class="head1">OUTWARD ATTIRE</h2><p>A worker of the Lord has to pay attention to his outward attire. He should not dishonor his status as a worker of the Lord. He should neither be too fashionable nor too shabby in his attire, but he should pay much attention to cleanliness. Our dress should not speak of anything beyond our status. We also must pay attention to our manners. If we are invited to a meal, try to make as little noise as possible at the table. Before we travel to any place, we should wash and groom ourselves properly, presenting ourselves to others with a good appearance. The most important thing to remember is to avoid putting on anything that will strike others' eyes. A worker of the Lord should strike others only with his words; everything else should remain plain, common, and unnoticeable. If a worker does not take care of this, others will be attracted to the striking things and will ignore his speaking. Anything special will attract attention and distract others from the content of our speaking.</p><p>The first thing we should do when we go to a place is to dress the same way as the local people. Never be special in any way; always be as plain as possible. For example, when working in the villages, do not dress too formally or be too clean. Of course, we should not purposely wear dirty clothes. We should always be sensitive to others' feelings when we are among them. Our outward attire should not be too different from theirs.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MANNER</h2><p>A worker of the Lord must be polite. We should not be loose among familiar brothers and sisters. As a worker of the Lord, our walk must be proper. We have to behave civilly among the saints. Never be uncouth in any way. Even the way we walk should be proper; we should not be rash in doing anything. We have to learn to be inconspicuous and to be common and plain in our walk and move. Paul was right when he was known to be weak in bodily presence (2 Cor. 10:10). Learn not to be loose. We should sanctify ourselves among the brothers and sisters. Others can laugh at some matters, but we cannot laugh at them. Others can say some things, but we cannot say the same things. We have to learn the proper lessons in our daily walk and habit. We should let others feel our sobriety and weightiness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE WORK IN KULING AND<br />THE WORK THROUGHOUT CHINA</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: September 8, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><p>I feel that we should let the brothers and sisters know as soon as possible about the way ahead of them. Some are still not clear about what to do, while others are clear already. Those who do not know can pray to the Lord. If you do not have a clear guidance from the Lord, you should let us know as soon as possible. Let me talk a little about the work here in Kuling and also about the work throughout China. I have considered dividing our work into ten divisions or regions. At least one or two of these regions have made a start already.</p><p>1) Shanghai region: This includes the area along the Shanghai-Hangchow railway. The center is Shanghai.</p><p>2) Foochow region: This takes care of Fukien province and Taiwan province. The center is Foochow. Northern Fukien and southwestern Fukien are not included in this region.</p><p>3) Wenchow region: Northern Fukien is part of this region. There is a definite need to have a start in this region. There are well over a hundred churches in this region.</p><p>Our strength lies in the clarity of the teaching concerning the ground of locality. Our weakness lies in the fact that our work does not have a center. There was no interruption in our meetings even during the war years because we were clear about the ground of locality. Although we did not have pastors and preachers, we were able to carry on with the breaking of bread, worship, and preaching. However, we became scattered because we did not have a center for the work. We admit that the mistake is on our part. We are willing to face this mistake. Now we have seen clearly from the Bible that there are regions to the work.</p><p>4) Peking-Tientsin region: We hope that a region will be raised up in northern China, including Peking and Tientsin. We hope that gradually this region will be extended to Shansi, Suiyuen, Ningshia, and even to Inner Mongolia.</p><p>Before the war there were four million Catholics in China but less than six hundred thousand Protestants. After the war, there were three million Catholics, while the Protestants numbered about four hundred and eighty thousand, or slightly less than five hundred thousand. Although there has been a slight decrease, the decrease is not significant. Many were lost during these years. (The above numbers also include the nominal ones.) Thirty percent of the Catholics are living in Inner Mongolia. Their work extends westward towards Shansi.</p><p>5) Tsingtao region: This region extends west of the Jiao-Ji Railway and south of the Jin-Pu Railway.</p><p>6) Canton region: This is the southern China region. Canton is the center; it includes Hong Kong. The further one moves south in this region, the more unstable the situation becomes. The people are less dependable, and the testimony is less promising. This region bears the responsibility of both Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces.</p><p>7) Hakka region: When we were at Custom Lane, we felt the need to have Swatow as a center. There are over thirty assemblies in southwestern Kiangsi and southeastern Fukien. We can even count southwestern Fukien as part of this region.</p><p>8) The literature work: The literature work, such as the publishing of books and periodicals, is considered a separate unit of the work. Such works are handled by Shanghai.</p><p>9) The work in Kuling: The work in Kuling is also separate. It is situated in Foochow.</p><p>10) Itinerant preaching: In the past we paid much attention to the local churches. This is the line of Antioch; yet we forgot about the line of Jerusalem. Today we have to pay equal attention to the Jerusalem line and the Antioch line. During the past few months we have been dealing with personal spiritual problems. From now on, we have to deal with the Lord concerning our work. If any of us has any kind of feeling at all, please let us know so that together we can make the proper decisions.</p><p>The work among these ten areas is not that simple. We are short both in manpower and in finances. Let us consider again in detail the work in these ten areas.</p><p>There is the need for an immediate start in Wenchow. Peking-Tientsin, Canton, and Swatow (Hakka) can wait for one or two months; they can join together to boost Wenchow first. We can gather the brothers and sisters who have a heart to serve in Wenchow, train them for two or three weeks, and then send them out to different places for the work after the training. We have to share with them the things we have seen in Kuling. There is also the need for building a new meeting hall. The present meeting hall can only hold two to three hundred people. We have only three sisters from Wenchow who are in this training. Miss Gui should return to Shanghai and then move to the Wenchow region. You should pray about it first, and consider what you should do.</p><p>Concerning our work in the coming days, I hope that we will increase the flow between the north and the south. (If Brother Witness is to move here, we will need many brothers and sisters to go to Shanghai.) Brother Chai Chi needs more time to rest.</p><p>Tsingtao is presently under special circumstances. Outwardly it is being surrounded. Yet it is a promising region, and there are many promising ones from this region. Brother Zi-jieh can return to this region. Perhaps the brothers from Chefoo will also go to Tsingtao. In the future the work in Chefoo and Tsinan will hinge on Tsingtao. The brothers from Peking-Tientsin should temporarily go to Tsingtao, Canton, or Wenchow to strengthen the work in these places. I am only speaking of general principles.</p><p>Brothers Liu Xiao-liang and Suen Feng-lu should move to Tsingtao to strengthen the testimony there. We hope that the work in Tsingtao will begin immediately. Today we are merely telling you what our feelings are. Sisters Sung Tien-dong, Dong Huang De-hui, and Wang Shu-ching should be relocated. Perhaps they should not return to their own localities. Sister Sung and Sister Dong may return to Tsingtao.</p><p>Hakka region: The Hakka region is too weak at present. I hope that Brother James Chen can move to Swatow and bear the responsibility of the work in the Hakka region. The work in this region should begin from Swatow. The brothers and sisters who come from this region should perhaps go back to this region and begin working there. The situation in this region is different from that in Wenchow. There is the need for pioneering and foundational work. I hope that some can help Brother James in this area. Brothers Chen Ke-san and Tsai Chi-chung should discuss among themselves and see if another brother can be spared to help Brother James. We hope that this will take care of the need for a while. Perhaps the real work in this region has to wait until the work in Wenchow is well on its way.</p><p>Brother Weigh has to take more responsibility in Canton. In addition, I hope that some brothers and sisters from the north will also move to this area. This region needs someone with weighty spiritual stature to oversee the spiritual condition. We have to strengthen the brothers and sisters as well as the workers. There is also the need for some strong sisters. Sisters Lin, Tseng, and Lei should best be stationed in Canton while they begin their work in the Canton region. Other than gaining a few from the Christian and Missionary Alliance, nothing was raised up in Canton. God's way depends on man. Material supplies and finances are minor matters; the most important factor is the person. Catholicism is weakest in Kwangsi province; it is difficult for the Catholics to work in that region. There is definitely the need to strengthen the work in Kwangtung and Kwangsi.</p><p>Peking-Tientsin is still the region with the greatest amount of foreign influence. The best place for the center in this region is Peking. It is the center of education and the best place to establish student work. There are plenty of opportunities there. However, the meeting in Peking at present is behind that in Tientsin. The meeting hall in Peking must be built. The brothers have to bear more responsibility there. The brothers and sisters from Manchuria should temporarily stay in Peking, but the work in this region can only begin after the work in Tsingtao has had a start.</p><p>It is best if four or five co-workers travel together for itinerant preaching. They should go whenever a local church invites them. Every time they travel, they should have at least three brothers and two sisters in a team. Brother Hsu Jung-jieh and Sister Miao can take the lead in this matter. The question of lodging can be settled later. Brother Chow Kang-yao may have to travel. Brother Chow Hung-bao is not yet clear about his way ahead. These brothers and sisters either have their families with them here on the mountain, or they may reside in Foochow.</p><p>The need for the literature work is great. The Ministers is for news and reports on the work. The Way is for the new believers. The Testimony is for older brothers and sisters. (We hope that we can put out one issue a week.) The Gospel is for the unbelievers. We are also working on some reference books. These are not general books; they are for helping readers understand the Bible. We hope that we can translate some books, such as Henry Alford's word study. We hope to do a paraphrase of Darby's Synopsis of the Bible. This means rewriting it in language that we can understand. This is not for our study, but for reference and comparison. What these ones wrote may not be altogether correct. We hope also to translate Grant's Numerical Bible, at least the New Testament part. Alford opens the meaning of individual words in the Bible, Darby shows the meaning of the Bible as a whole, while Grant directs us to the proper method of exegesis. The literature work is not the work of the High Priest but the work of the Levites. If we have seven or eight sisters to help us, we can prepare our own concordance.</p><p>As for the translation of the New Testament, I think we need at least four different versions. The first is a paraphrase version, in which we use our own words to express the text. This is not a word-for-word translation, and its emphasis is on the overall meaning of the text. The second is a revised version of the New Testament. We will render a new translation of the present New Testament. This version emphasizes the accuracy of the words as well as their meaning within the text. This will be a proper translation of the text. The third is an even more literal translation. For example, it will put the word and in front of a sentence when the Greek word kai is present (e.g., Matt. 15:33). This version will be a Chinese rendering that is strictly based on Greek grammar. But these three versions are not enough; there is the need of a fourth version. In the fourth version we need to highlight some special words, such as the articles. In Greek, some nouns have articles attached to them, while others do not. In English, this would be rendered, for example, as "the Paul" in some instances. We need to spend ten years to take care of these special expressions. Such a version will have a one-to-one correspondence between every Greek word and Chinese word.</p><p>If we can finish these within a few years, our next generation will be able to study the Bible better because they will have reference books in their hand. Those who come after us will only need to compare the four versions to arrive at the proper meaning of a passage. What is lacking today are reference books and proper versions of the Bible. Perhaps Brother James (not James Chen) should stay with us to participate in the literature work. It would be best to have a Chinese translation of the Bible which establishes proper spiritual terms.</p><p>Those who are involved in the literature work must be very diligent. They cannot be lazy. They must familiarize themselves with the expressions and styles of the Bible. In the past we have published many spiritual writings, but we have not put out enough reference books. The dictionary of the Bible by Mr. Wood is out of print. We can write him and ask him to reprint it. Brother Chou Shing-yi and Brother James should give themselves to this literature work.</p><p>In Kuling we are working on two kinds of people specifically. The first are the co-workers. The second are the responsible brothers of the local churches. We expect those who stay in the dormitories to rise up early. The scattered bungalows can be prepared as lodgings and rest houses for the trainees. The weather can be unfriendly here on the mountain only during the months of December and January; the rest of the year it is very suitable for our training. I hope that Miss Kuo and Miss Zuo can stay here on the mountain.</p><p>Here on the mountain, we hope to meet according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14. Everyone can say something, and at the end we can have some kind of judgment on a subject.</p><p>The above is a general sketch of the work; it is not a kind of final decision. On the one hand, we have the corporate view, but on the other hand, we take care of the individual's feelings. There needs to be a balance between the corporate and the individual.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW OTHER CONCERNS</h2><p>Concerning the relationship between apostles and elders: If the elders in a locality are strong, they can join the apostles in their work.</p><p>Concerning the places that are considered as centers: When the work grows to a certain point, the brothers and sisters have to be sent out. We believe that as soon as some are sent out, more will come in to fill their places. For example, Hong Kong has experienced a constant shift of population in the past. Yet its number has not decreased.</p><p>Concerning the gospel and the edification of new believers: We should have prepared over fifty topics for the gospel by now. In the coming days we hope to add more material to cover other areas. We hope that the material used in the gospel meeting and the edification of new believers meeting will be unified throughout the country. This will ensure that the brothers and sisters will continue along the same lines without any overlap or interruption. Those who are responsible for preaching the gospel and edifying the new believers must themselves live in the reality of their messages. Otherwise, their messages will become like the formal prayers of the Anglican Church. In the work of edifying the new believers, the important thing is to track down the brothers and sisters one by one. Do not let them get away easily.</p><p>Concerning migration: If a church sends out saints for the migration, its number will not diminish. We should encourage the matter of migration.</p><p>Concerning serving together as the church: Before the war, there were a little over one hundred thousand converts to Catholicism, plus over five hundred thousand had been baptized. This number equals the total number of Protestants gained during the past one hundred years, but the gospel work among the Protestants and the Catholics alike in China is far too slow. If the whole church will rise up to preach the gospel today, the Lord will do a new thing in China. When you return to your locality, you must break through in this one thing&mdash;get all the brothers and sisters in the church to rise up to work. Unless you can do this, your work is a failure. You have to make every piece of work in the church the responsibility of every brother and sister. The whole church has to be involved in the preaching of the gospel, the visiting of saints, or the edification of believers. All the one-talented ones have to put in their share. The whole church has to rise up to serve, and the whole church has to rise up to preach the gospel. Unless we do this, we are a big failure. We have to be very busy, yet at the same time, we have to make everyone else busy as well. I know this is very hard. If we are the only ones who are busy, and if all the works are in our hand, we are wrong. In the future if someone writes to us and says that the affairs of the church are on the shoulder of one person, we will say that of the seventy who were sent out by us for the work, this particular one has fallen. I hope that the brothers and sisters will all be clear about our way. We must mobilize all the brothers and sisters. The whole Body has to serve. This is the testimony that the Lord is after.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO MANAGE AFFAIRS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 13, 1948<br />Place:Kuling</h1><p>In order to be a worker of the Lord, the first thing we have to learn is to manage affairs in a proper way. Those who cannot manage affairs can never work for the Lord. Everyone who is good at the Lord's work is also good at managing affairs. Beginners in the Lord's work should learn in particular how to manage affairs properly. We will mention seven things in connection with the management of affairs.</p><h2 class="head1">NEVER CONSIDERING BUSINESS AFFAIRS<br />TO BE SOMETHING UNSPIRITUAL</h2><p>Those who are involved in management of business must be clear first of all that this activity is by no means unspiritual. Even Peter and John were involved in the distribution of food at one time. Stephen, who was filled with the Holy Spirit, was also a server of tables. The proper management of affairs is a necessary lesson that a beginner in the Lord's work must learn. If a man cannot manage affairs properly, he cannot work effectively. A young person must not offer himself simply "in prayer and in the ministry of the word." In many cases this is an excuse for idleness under the name of "prayer and ministry of the word." We have to uproot this. A person who is learning to serve the Lord should learn to "serve tables." Otherwise, he will not be able to do anything except preach. A learner in the Lord's work must learn to handle business properly, or else he will give ground to disdain and contempt. We must never consider the management of affairs as something unspiritual. It is something that a servant of the Lord must learn.</p><h2 class="head1">THINKING THINGS OVER</h2><p>Second, before we touch any matter, we have to know that it is God who has placed us there, and that we have to put our heart to the task. Those who are lazy with their hands are useless, and those who are lazy with their brain are also useless. Some people never give enough consideration to what they are about to do. It is harder to ask them to think about what they are going to do than to ask them to give up their lives. Such ones never accomplish anything. We have to consider carefully everything that pertains to the church. This does not mean that we must have an opinion about everything, but it does mean that we must be mindful of everything. Those who have not considered but who are quick to give opinions are counselors; they are not believers. Expressing an opinion means making proposals and having an instant reaction to matters. Being mindful of matters means to consider the causes and consequences of everything in a thorough way. Unless we think things over carefully, we will encounter many problems. In managing affairs, the more we think things over, the less problems we will face. Anything that we have considered well beforehand is handled judiciously. We should not be hasty in our opinions concerning any matter. We should not react lightly or propose quickly. Instead, we have to sit down and think things over carefully. No one should do anything without first considering and planning. Before a man builds a house, he must first sit down and plan. We have to be careful and sober in dealing with matters, and we should strive to glorify God in managing these affairs. Those who are careless in handling business affairs will be careless in preaching and studying the Scripture as well. The first thing we should do when we face a situation is to think the whole thing over. Those who are lazy in thinking are lazy in everything. In order to learn to serve God, we can never be lazy in our thinking.</p><h2 class="head1">BUDGETING TIME, MONEY, AND PERSONNEL</h2><p>After we have thought over the whole matter, we have to make a plan and write this plan down. Thinking enables us to understand the problem at hand, and planning enables us to come up with a solution to deal with the problem. The first thing to plan is our time, next is money, and third is the manpower needed to do the work. Whenever a job comes to us, we have to budget the time, money, and number of people needed. For example, if a man wants to build a house, he has to calculate the time, money, and number of workers needed to finish the job. He must also factor in all the possible changes that may occur throughout the course of the project. This planning provides the necessary information for building his house.</p><h2 class="head1">MAKING ARRANGEMENTS</h2><p>Fourth, in addition to being mindful of possible problems that one may encounter and counting the cost, one has to make constant decisions. He has to be clear in his mind as to how he should place the right people in the right place, and what they should do. The previous point deals with gathering information; one estimates the time, money, and manpower necessary to do a job. All these are information. They give us an idea of the different kinds of problems that need to be solved before we can accomplish a task. We must write down these points one by one. For example, if we are going to leave the mountain now, we have to find out how many people need to leave on sedan chairs and how many chairs we now have. We need an accurate count of all these things. When all the facts are in place, we can go on to the fourth point, which is to make the proper arrangements. If the facts are wrong in the first place, it is impossible to make the right judgments. Therefore, before we can talk about a proper arrangement, we must have reliable facts. This means that there is the need for much thinking and deliberation. No one can accomplish anything without giving thought to his work. The Lord Jesus taught His disciples how to manage business affairs when He was on the earth. Once He asked them to distribute bread to five thousand people. Another time He asked them to distribute bread to four thousand people. This is the reason they were able to baptize three thousand and then five thousand people at Pentecost. In feeding the five thousand, the Lord asked them to arrange the crowd into rows; there was no confusion. At that time the crowd was hungry, and if the people had pressed against one another, it would have been chaos. The Lord asked them all to sit down so that there would not be any confusion. He made them sit down in groups of fifty and one hundred. There was no confusion, and there was no monotonous repetition; everything was in order. After the disciples learned this, they repeated the lesson again at a later time. This is the reason that there was no confusion at Pentecost, even though three thousand and later five thousand were baptized. They had a pattern to follow. The multiplication of the bread was a miracle, but the distribution and consumption of the bread depended on human arrangement. The Lord performed a miracle in the multiplication of the bread, but He did not perform a miracle in the distribution and consumption of it. He did not perform a miracle by dropping the bread into each person's stomach directly. He trained the disciples to do things in the proper way.</p><p>In doing things we must first find out the facts in a detailed way and then make arrangements accordingly. When we face a task, the first thing we should do is think it over and then find the proper way. Only after we have taken these steps should we make the proper arrangements. Many people fail to get things done because they have never come up with the proper way. We must first think things over carefully and then do a detailed analysis. After we are clear about all the facts, we have to pray much. We have to ask the Lord what we should do with all the things that are laid before us. The Lord told the five thousand to sit down. Once they sat down, they became stationary. This was wisdom on the Lord's part. The crowd was already trampling upon one another when they listened to the word. How much more would they have trampled each other if they had started squabbling for the bread! The Lord told them to sit down. Once they sat down, all the problems were solved. The Lord was very wise in making these arrangements. In making arrangements there is much need of prayer. We have to pray until we get wisdom. The Lord's arrangement not only allowed the crowd to eat in an orderly fashion but also took care of all the crumbs expeditiously. Hence, in doing things we have to know how to make proper arrangements. We should never leave anything to chance, and it is not enough to exercise just our mouth. In finding the proper way of doing things, it is better to be as specific as possible; one should not be general in anything.</p><h2 class="head1">EXECUTING THINGS PROPERLY AND<br />GIVING ADEQUATE EXPLANATION</h2><p>The fifth crucial thing to remember in doing things is that we need a good plan of execution. Before carrying out a job, we must first have enough information, and this information must be accurate and reliable. Our assignment of personnel must be suitable; everyone should have his or her own responsibility, and there must not be confusion of any kind. In building a house, we put one stone upon another. If one stone falls, all the ones attached to it will fall as well. Those making the arrangements should consider who is capable of doing each aspect. The arrangements should suit the capacity and aspiration of each person. It is important that in charging anyone to do anything, we have to speak to them ahead of time. Everyone should understand what they are supposed to do. We should not assume that others understand; we should explain with our own words. We should not be afraid of being repetitious. It is not a matter of how many times we repeat a statement, but a matter of how much the charged ones have understood. We should not wait until others encounter problems in the work before opening our mouth. Rather, we should clearly explain the method and the way ahead of time and then assign the jobs. Those who are giving orders are responsible for making perfectly clear what the charged ones are supposed to do. If the ones giving the orders are not explicit in their explanation, they bear the responsibility for any failure. If a leader does not have the assurance that he can take the lead, he should not be a leader in the first place.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING</h2><p>Explaining things clearly and making the assignments is not enough. We have to arrange for drills and practices. Others should not only understand what to do, but they must also be given the opportunity to practice and make trial runs. This is very important. A worker must not only be capable of working by himself but must also be able to direct others to the work. The work of "prayer and the ministry of the word" is not for everyone. Even Stephen had to remain a server of tables. Hence, every one of us has to practice doing things in the proper way. This is particularly true for doing things which are difficult, unfamiliar, and new; there is the need to have practice sessions ahead of time.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THOSE<br />WHO HAVE COMMITTED MISTAKES</h2><p>Some may ask, "What should we do with those who have committed mistakes?" There are two kinds of people who make mistakes. The first are the lazy ones; those who are lazy often make mistakes. The second are the proud ones; those who are proud also make mistakes easily. A lazy person is uncaring and unconcerned, while a proud person thinks that he can do everything. Those who are proud should be given some form of punishment when they make a mistake. They can be told that they will no longer be assigned such a responsibility. Everyone else will have an assignment in the service; they alone will be left out. They must humble themselves before they will be given another assignment. If a lazy person commits a mistake, he should be exhorted; he must not be allowed to give up. The more he wants to give up, the more we have to force him to do it. We have to perfect him. If he makes a mistake again, we have to go to him again. We have to force him to take up responsibilities; he cannot remain an uncaring and irresponsible person. The prouder a person is, the less he should be assigned responsibility, but the lazier a person is, the more he should be assigned work. It is a sign of laziness to refuse to work by using preaching as an excuse. More than half of the reason for neglect among the co-workers is laziness.</p><p>The above seven guidelines are principles of managing affairs. They are methods of doing things. If we follow these principles and carry them out properly, we will be of great use to the Lord's work. There is always room for more learning in the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">RECORD OF A TALK</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:October 3, 1948<br />Place:Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h2><p>There is some difference between the laying on of hands and bread-breaking and baptism. In the conversion of the three thousand and the five thousand in Acts 2 and 4 and in the outpouring of the Spirit in the house of Cornelius, the Bible does not say anything about the laying on of hands. It is clear that through the baptism of the Holy Spirit all the members were baptized into one Body. First Corinthians 12:13 says that all the believers have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. There is no need to have any additional procedure, but in Samaria and Ephesus we find the laying on of hands (Acts 8:14-17; 19:6). This is because those two instances were somewhat special. The Samaritans had no contact with the Jews. When some in Samaria became believers, they needed the laying on of hands to usher them into the fellowship of the Body. The disciples in Ephesus who received the laying on of hands were baptized through the baptism of John, and they had to be brought into the fellowship of the Body.</p><p>Hebrews 6 speaks of baptisms in the plural. This refers to the many Jewish ordinances regarding purification. At the time Hebrews was written, the temple was still there, and many Hebrew believers were still under the influence of their Jewish background. The same can be said about the ordinance regarding purification in Acts 21.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FOOT-WASHING</h2><p>Foot-washing is a sign of Christ's humility. It is an actual practice, not just an illustration. The Lord's word in John 13:14 shows that He intended for His disciples to learn this lesson of humility. This is a personal gesture and act (cf. 1 Tim. 5:10); it is not something done in a corporate way. The same can be said about kissing. At the time the Lord was on the earth, foot-washing was a common Jewish practice. The Jews wore loose sandals. When they entered a house, they first needed to wash their feet. This was something that a servant would do. This is like the Chinese who offer guests a wash basin and a cup of tea before serving the meal. This practice is not found in other countries. If the Lord were in China, He could have said, "I am the host. Today I am serving you towels to wash your face. This is the work of a servant.

I believe that the brothers and sisters can see the reason for our arrangements.</p><p>We have to realize that all problems in our service rest entirely with the person of the workers. For this reason, we have to be trained in our very person as well as in the ministry. This time we have seen a little concerning the way to serve. Actually, our greatest lack before God is not our ministry but our personal daily walk. In this training sixty-nine brothers and sisters have presented their testimonies. Their condition is a fair representation of all the brothers and sisters everywhere. During the second morning session, we have covered the need of knowing the proper kind of Christian walk. Our training has emphasized three things: ministry, our walk, and new believers' lessons. Now that you have seen these things, please remember that you must not repeat and duplicate what we have talked about here. We were free to say what was said because we have all handed ourselves over to the Lord.</p><p>I am not making any clarification for myself; rather, I am showing you that I have never interfered with others' business in the past. Some brothers like Simon Meek and Faithful Luk have known me for decades. Brother Luk, who is very close to me, has asked me twenty times by letter and even three times while we were here on the mountain, to open up myself. This time I am giving myself to you. I am revealing my own secrets. In the future if I open up myself again, I want to do it myself. If you try to do it for me, it is unrighteousness as far as I am concerned. What we have released here, with the exception of our lessons on the way to study the Scripture and the messages in the evenings, should not be broadcast. In particular, you should not imitate my style or my tone. In other places I have done exceptional things for the sake of meeting the needs of the churches in those places. In my life I have done three very exceptional things. First, I felt the need to write The Spiritual Man when I had tuberculosis and the doctor told me that I was about to die. Second, I spoke on matters that I had been constrained from speaking about for many years when I returned from overseas. When I was abroad, friends asked if I had learned my utterance in China. When I came back to China, some thought that I picked up my utterance overseas. Often we imagine things that bear no resemblance to reality at all. Third, I have spoken as I have done during the past months in Kuling. I have opened up myself and given myself to you. I have done it once, and I will not do it again. I owe the church nothing, because I have done all I can. I have spoken all that I should speak. I have given myself to you unreservedly. I hope that you will see the Lord's way. If you do not rise up now, the church will have no way to go on. If the ministers will not rise up, the church will have no way to go on. The responsibility is not on me any longer. I have washed my hands. The fault does not lay with me any longer. The responsibility is now on your shoulders.</p><p>I thank you all for coming this time. We made the decision to have this training at the last minute. It was a little unfair to you because we did not give you enough time to prepare yourselves. I hope that you will not communicate to ordinary brothers and sisters what we have done here in Kuling. Allow me to say a word "beside myself" (2 Cor. 11:23). I have received enough glory and suffered enough shame already. In the future I do not wish to receive any more glory or shame. I have my scruples and reasons for doing what I did here in Kuling. Some people say, "Do not worry; everything will be settled at the judgment seat." I do not have their confidence. I dare not say such a word. I am in God's hand, and I know that I am a hard person to deal with. I need God's word to deal with me. As one psalm says, "If [God is] silent to me, I become like those who go down into the pit" (Psa. 28:1).</p><p>After the last storm in my ministry, I became even clearer than before about what I have felt for the past ten years, which is that my ministry is for serving the ministers. My ministry is not to serve God's children in general; my ministry is among the ministers. I hope that you will not force me to move among the brothers and sisters in the church. If you do, I will be exposed before all the believers. Please do not imitate me. No brother or sister can be the same as I am in disposition or service. Everyone has his own pathway. Romans 14:4 tells us clearly that each one of us has our own pathway before the Lord, and the Lord will make us stand.</p><p>I know inwardly the way I should take. I know that I was slandered and attacked twenty times in pamphlets and through mass distribution of negative booklets. For this reason my service to other Christians can only be indirect; I cannot serve them directly. I am not saying that I am angry at the pamphlets and the booklets. God knows that I smiled at them more than I frowned at them. When others accused me of weaknesses, I readily admitted it. The facts might have been wrong, but it was right that I should receive criticism. As far as the facts are concerned, they might not have condemned what I condemned, and they might have condemned what I would not condemn. At any rate, I do not want other brothers and sisters to know what I am doing here at Kuling. If they know about it, I am afraid much damage will be done. You should only let others see and hear the spiritual benefits you have received; you should not teach others the doctrines and outward practices you have received.</p><p>My position among God's children is quite unique and exceptional. The churches and God's children have to bear the responsibility for such uniqueness. It is they who have made me so unique. The fact is: I am not unwilling to learn, but there are many reasons involved. Here we are training those who are already on the way, who are involved in the work, and who are taking some responsibility in the church. The work here in Kuling can only make the good ones better and the useful ones more useful. It does not attempt to change those with different opinions or who take different ways. The work in Kuling touches the innermost part of man. I say the innermost part, not the deepest part. If anyone has different opinions or takes different ways, I cannot release anything before them. This is like talking to friends. If outsiders are among us, it would be hard to speak intimate things to our friends.</p><p>If anyone among us has a somewhat different attitude, if he has any criticism, or if he has the slightest doubt about us, we do not want him to come. On the mountain we speak intimate words. If anyone here feels that he is in the wrong place, tell us and we will remove his name from our list. We cannot deal with opinionated ones here. One opinionated one means that I have to waste much energy on him. I do not want to entertain those who come just with their ears or eyes. My ministry is for those who want to receive it; it is not for sightseers and spectators. You may blame me for these limitations, but I truly know that this is my ministry. Please allow me to fulfill my ministry while on this mountain. I will not interfere with any of the problems or affairs of the churches. Those away from the mountain do not know what we are doing on the mountain, but you have to know. Unless I have a group of people in one accord here on the mountain, I cannot fulfill my ministry. Here I am not serving as a minister of the church, nor as a co-worker. Please give me the liberty. Please allow me to give myself away freely, and please do not interfere with what I am doing.</p><p>Let me mention the three main things which we have covered. First, I have spoken of selling our possessions and handing over ourselves. Second, I have spoken of conducting the work in the principle of Jerusalem. Third, I have spoken of the whole Body rising up to serve in the priesthood. These three things must be preached when you leave the mountain here. As for your personal experiences, I hope that you will learn many lessons before the Lord. I have presented the principles of life and service to you, as well as the way of a Christian. I have spent myself on you. I doubt if anyone else has given himself to you in the way that I have done. This is the reason I do not want to spend time on those who criticize or who take different ways. I do not have the burden to deal with them. I beg you not to force me to serve all the Christians in general.</p><p>What we have spoken concerning the daily living and character of a minister should not be spread. Some of our words should stay here on the mountain.</p><p>Now you may go. But this does not mean that all your problems are solved. During the past few months, I have been burdened for every one of you. I have noticed how you have moved on. Although I cannot say that all of you have climbed many mountains, I can say one thing: At least you have all moved on. You have all taken a step forward. I am not speaking for myself, and I have no intention to speak for myself, but I can say that God has granted us mercy. This mercy does not come all the time, nor is it something that God freely gives. Many times God speaks freely, and we can say that it is God's mercy. Except for the two meetings in the morning two days ago, we can say that there is very little lack or shortage in our speaking. It is rare to see God speaking in such a way. The light you have received here is special. Many of you have just started on this way. I hope when I see you again the next time, I can find a certain measure of spiritual accumulation in you and a certain knowledge of the spiritual pathway. I hope that you will all reap abundant results from this training. When you leave here, you will encounter all kinds of circumstances. You will face all kinds of demands in the ministry. At that time you will find the supply, and you will have to supply others as well. At least you should be able to say that you have seen the way to serve God today, and you should be able to do your best to serve in this way. If you can do this, you will be a faithful minister of God.</p><p>Concerning the political situation, it is impossible for God to gain ground in the church and in us without working in the surrounding environment at the same time. We can see that the defeat of Japan is God's answer to the church's prayer. Today God can answer the church's prayer again. In a war, it is God's children who ultimately suffer. No matter who wins in the coming days, our only wish is that we will be allowed to meet and worship. May the Lord open the way for us.</p><p>I hope that you will launch forward with a firm determination. I hope that you will not miss the way ahead of you.</p><h2 class="head1">WATCHMAN NEE'S PRAYER</h2><p>Lord, go with these servants and maidservants of Yours. May Your grace be with them for as long as their pathway stretches. May Your solution be found wherever a problem appears. May You defeat all the enemies before them, and may the enemies never be allowed to flourish in even one thing. Grant them the grace to break Satan's fiery darts and arrows. May You go forth with them. Go before them in places where they have not gone before and work before them in areas where they have not yet labored. Open a straight way before them and keep them faithful and steadfast. Grant them light all the time. Do not allow them to remain in darkness. Do not allow anyone to become lost or cut off from grace. Bless them richly. May none of them be left behind or lost. May they learn to place themselves in Your hands. Bless them and be gracious to them. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH THE CO-WORKERS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:October 1948<br />Place:Brother Nee's home, Foochow</h1><h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD'S CHILDREN</h2><p>In the Shanghai Concession (the area ceded to foreign powers) and in Hong Kong (a British colony), a foreign man can be deported for committing certain crimes. If a Chinese commits the same crime on Chinese soil, he cannot be treated the same way because he is standing on different ground. No matter where he is sent, he will still be on Chinese soil. A preacher once spoke sternly, "Look at your co-workers! What kind of persons they are!" Our attitude should take God's attitude as its standard. We cannot reject what God accepts, and we cannot accept what God rejects. We may have sloppy and underqualified brothers, but we must ask, "Is he a brother?" If he is, we cannot "deport" him, unless he has committed excommunicable sins. We can excommunicate a student from a school, but we cannot excommunicate and reject a brother from a family. If anyone thinks that he can choose between brothers, I can exercise a choice as well. But a brother is a brother. We cannot cut off our relationship with him. The basic principle of the church is recovery, not excommunication.</p><p>When I was at White Teeth Lake, I once argued with Miss Barber. She said she wanted to gather a group of overcomers together. I said, "This is wrong. If you do, you are making yourself a sect." We believe in the truth concerning the overcomers, but we cannot choose a group of overcomers to form an overcomers' group. I knew about a certain situation concerning a brother. A few years later, others knew about it as well. When they found this out, they asked why I tolerated him for such a long time. I thought in my heart, "A sect can choose whom it likes, but we cannot exercise such a choice among God's children; we cannot choose whom we like in the church." Of course, when a man chooses to leave of his own accord, that is a different story.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO TREAT THE CO-WORKERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Leading the Co-workers, Not Choosing Them</h2><p>The same principle applies to the work. All of God's servants are our co-workers. Our pathway is not one of exercising our choice but one of bringing the brothers and sisters to a proper condition. All workers, and indeed all leaders, should not choose only brothers and sisters whom they think are useful. A worker is produced through leading, not through choice. In the church in Corinth, Cephas, Apollos, and Paul did not exercise preference or choice over any brother or sister. Yet some among them wanted to create a sect. They declared their allegiance to certain ones. What would have happened if Cephas or Apollos or Paul exercised their preference as well? In leading others, it is not enough for us to know and judge others' condition. Our heart must be broad, and we must be broad. One of Hudson Taylor's virtues was that he was genuinely interested in every worker. A worker must spend all his energy and pay the greatest price to help the useless ones to become useful. A good foreman is one who is able to lead others. In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus dispensed what He had to the twelve disciples, and at least eleven of them were gained.</p><p>As you set out for your work and as you work with other co-workers, you may feel that this or that one is terrible. You may write to me to ask for a change of partners, but I do not have that many alternatives for you. One brother said that many of the co-workers on the mountain are actually not qualified to be servants of God, but I can only respond, "I use what the Lord uses. Our responsibility is to lead others. We can only use what God has given us. We cannot use what God has not given us." I have said previously that we should bear in mind whether or not others are above us, and we should readily yield to them when we set out in our work. This is especially true of those who are the leaders of a region. Sister Pearl Wang later told me that it was useless to say such a word because in reality there are no such advanced ones in all the regions. This is right. God only uses men who are already available. We should do the same. We should not sit and wait for the unmanifested "qualified ones" to appear. The Lord used Judas until the night before His crucifixion. Before that night no one knew that he was going to betray the Lord.</p><p>We should not use our judgments of men as material for gossip. Our judgments are merely for the purpose of carrying out our authority. It is not an easy thing to be a foreman in the work. The church is here to build, not to tear down. We must not lose sight that we are here to edify others. We should be clear about everything that is going on in the church, but we should not be that clear about the condition of our co-workers. I believe that everyone can be edified. If we do not believe this, there is something wrong with us. Everyone loves and cherishes his own body. There should be the same concern for the spiritual Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Doing Our Best to Lead and to Perfect</h2><p>We have to be clear in our principle and in our direction. If we realize that the Lord has used a person, even if only once, we have to help him. If a person has rendered the Lord some service, even if only once, we have to lead him on. One of our greatest temptations is to reject men. We should not look at the twelve disciples and say, "They are all like Judas!" Our leadership and guidance in the positive direction must be strong. This is a hard work, and it demands a high price. May I say a word "beside myself" again: If I am given a choice to reject, I am afraid many of the ones I know would have been rejected long ago already! The practice of rejection is contagious. In leading others we must never say, "I have exhausted my patience!" We must have longsuffering. If our patience is unlimited, our edification and recovery will also be unlimited, and the church will be built up. Every mother has her heart pierced by knives repeatedly. Every time her heart is pierced, her heart becomes broadened and expanded. In perfecting others, we should be like mothers cherishing their children.</p><p>Consider the doctors in Shanghai. They receive casualties from the police and the Red Cross every day, casualties from traffic accidents. If they consider the condition of the patients to be serious, they amputate immediately. But if a relative or family member pleads for treatment, the doctors spend three or four times the effort to stitch the dismembered parts back to the body. Let me ask, "Is the church in the business of stitching dismembered ones back in or in the business of amputation?" The first choice is to recover the severed members. Amputating a member is always the last choice. As much as possible, we should lead, help, and edify others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">A CHANGE OF CONCEPT<br />CONCERNING VALUE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 23:16-26</h1><p>A person often measures the value of something according to the amount of knowledge he has of it. In Matthew 23:16-26 we find some people whose eyes were on the splendor of the temple and how it was built mostly with gold. They considered the temple to be most valuable. Some saw the altar and compared it with the oxen, lambs, and turtle doves offered on it. They reckoned the altar to be of little value but the oxen and lambs and turtle doves to be of much value. Some offered a tenth of the mint, anise, and cummin, yet they neglected the weightier matters of the law&mdash;justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Some were very careful about everything. They strained out the gnat, but they swallowed the camel. Some were in a hurry to use the cup and the dish. They cleansed the outside of them, but inwardly there was filth. We can ask a new believer, "How would you evaluate these different kinds of people if you met them? What do you think of their concept of value?" In Matthew 23:16-26 the Lord Jesus called these people fools, blind men, and hypocrites because they did not know the true concept of value. Their concept of value was all wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">A GENUINE BELIEVER HAVING A CHANGE<br />IN HIS CONCEPT OF VALUE</h2><p>Before a person believes in the Lord, his concept of value is perverted. But once a person is saved, his concept of value changes. He no longer cherishes what he once cherished, and he treasures what he once despised. This is a change in his concept of value. Anyone who has not witnessed such a change in concept is not a genuine Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHANGE IN CONCEPT OF VALUE IN A BELIEVER</h2><p>The Bible has much to say concerning a change in one's concept of value. Such passages on this change can shed light to the new believers. These passages show us the proper concept of value for a Christian. Let us consider a few examples to prove our point.</p><h2 class="head2">The Valuation of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>Psalm 118:22 says, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner." This is a change in valuation. In the eyes of the builders, they rejected what they considered to be a useless stone. In the eyes of the Jewish leaders, Christ was something redundant, and they wanted to get rid of Him. Yet this rejected stone was chosen to be the cornerstone of the newly enacted salvation. A cornerstone must be flat on at least two or three sides. Actually it should be flat on all six sides. God treasured the cornerstone which was rejected by the Jewish builders and used it for the building of His salvation. How different are these two kinds of valuation! We have to bring new believers to such a change in valuation. We have to ask how they viewed Christ before and how they view Christ now. We have to show them that what was once worthless is now priceless. What was once untrustworthy is now trustworthy. Others have rejected Christ, but we treasure Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Word of the Cross</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:18 says, "For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." The cross is despised by those who are perishing; it is considered foolishness by them. Yet it is held precious by the saved ones and received by them as the power of God. This speaks of the great change in valuation of the cross, from the time before a person is saved to the time after he is saved. Before a person is saved, he considers the cross useless. After he is saved, he sees it as the power of God, something precious and valuable. Once a person believes in the Lord, his concept of value changes immediately. The salvation of the cross becomes something very precious.</p><h2 class="head2">The Contrast between<br />God's Kingdom and Righteousness<br />and a Man's Daily Necessities</h2><p>Matthew 6:32-33 says, "For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." Before a person believes in the Lord (this is especially true with poor people), the daily thoughts that plague him are for his daily necessities. Things pertaining to food and clothing are the greatest concerns of the human life. No unbeliever is an exception to this. But as soon as a person believes in the Lord, he turns to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. As believers, we have to realize that nothing in this life is more precious than the kingdom of God. Matthew 13:44 says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field. When a man finds it, he hides it and in his joy sells all that he has to buy that field. This refers to the Lord's discovering the treasure of the kingdom of the heavens and giving up Himself and all He has to buy the treasure. The Lord considers the kingdom of the heavens as something precious. Yet man does not treasure it. Only a believer with the Lord's view knows the preciousness of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Before a man believes in the Lord, he may not find it too hard to take care of his daily physical needs even though he may be poor. Since his life has nothing to do with the kingdom of God, he can lie or resort to other unrighteous means to meet the needs of his livelihood. After he believes in the Lord, he enters a new realm. If he still lies to secure his daily needs, he may find his job secured, but he will lose the kingdom of God and His righteousness. If he refuses to lie, he may gain God's kingdom and righteousness at the expense of his job. Which way should he choose? An unbeliever has little scruples about lying because clothing and goods are the most important things to him. But a believer is different. He should first seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Under such circumstances the workers should help the new believers in a definite way to make the right choice for that which is truly precious. We have to make it clear to them that food and clothing are for the body, but the body exists for the kingdom of God and His righteousness. As believers, we must first seek God's kingdom and His righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">Between the Lord and One's Relatives</h2><p>Matthew 10:37-38 says, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." A father, mother, wife, and children are the most precious things to a man. They are the most important things a man has in this life. When these are not compared with the Lord, there is nothing wrong in loving them. But when a situation arises where we have to choose between the two, which one will we choose? A man always chooses what is more precious to him, but which of the two is more precious? We have to help the brothers and sisters know the real precious thing. We can ask new believers, "Whom will you choose?" If they are not clear about this, they will be lost when they face temptations in the future. The responsibility of providing proper guidance is on our shoulders. We have to tell the new believers, "If, for the Lord's sake, you have to draw a separation line between yourself and your parents, wife, and children, will you choose Him? For His sake, that is, for the sake of the Lord who died for us, we should choose to be His disciples and follow Him." Our own kin are precious, but they are no comparison to the Lord. Our Lord is more precious than any of our kin.</p><h2 class="head2">Between Man's Soul and the World</h2><p>Matthew 16:26 says, "For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?" Here a comparison is made between man's soul and the whole world. Is the soul more precious or the world more precious? Many people see the preciousness of the world, but they do not see the preciousness of the soul. Today Satan is trying to buy man's soul, but many people are giving away their soul for free. This is because they do not believe their soul is worth anything. The prodigal son in Luke 15 did not leave his father's house because of the enticement of a grand feast; he succumbed to mere carob pods. How worthless is the soul in the eyes of an unbeliever! Yet the Lord says that the whole world put together cannot be exchanged for a soul. Satan offered a high price when he took the Lord to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. In exchange for His worship, the Lord would have been given all these things by Satan. This is the only instance in the Bible where Satan offered a high price for man's soul. Of course, he did not succeed. Suppose Satan did the same thing again and offered the whole world to any man who would worship him. What would anyone choose? This is altogether a matter of valuation. Should a man give up his soul to gain the world or should he give up the world to gain his soul? Today Satan is not offering to exchange the whole world for our soul. He does not think that our life is worth that much. He is enticing us with small benefits and small gains. Many children of God would lie for the sake of five catties of rice. They would forsake the Lord's way for just a little gain. This is like Balaam who degraded himself for profit to curse God's people. We have to show the new ones that honesty is worth more than gold, rice, or the whole world. In order to preserve the purity of our soul, we should be willing to forsake anything. We should teach the new ones properly at the very beginning of their Christian walk. We should help them to have a change in their concept of value. We should bring them to the proper pathway. This is very important, and the responsibility is on us.</p><h2 class="head2">Between the Body and Sin</h2><p>Matthew 18:8-9 says, "If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire." Here we see another contrast in valuation. A man can relinquish the love for the world, but he may not be able to relinquish the love for his body. Job 2:3 and 10 show how Job was able to maintain his integrity when he was first tempted by Satan. When Satan came to him the second time, he attacked Job's body, and Job began to curse the day he was born. He failed. This shows us that a man loves his body very much. In Matthew 18 the Lord shows us a solution with regard to the body. If preserving the body means preserving sin, we have to realize that it is better to give up the body than to sin. This means it is more serious to stumble than to sacrifice the body. A believer must have a change in his concept of value. He must see the seriousness of stumbling. Before a person believes in the Lord, he can commit many sins and set his eyes on many filthy things. After he believes in the Lord, his hands and eyes must be restricted. He must be shown the grave consequence of sin from the first day. Cutting off the hand and plucking out the eyes are only illustrations. The real significance is that one should sever sin even if this means enduring as much pain as the severing of hands, feet, or eyes. A Christian has to realize the seriousness of sin. He should deal with sin as drastically as severing the parts of his body. This preserves his own sanctity and purity.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Position</h2><p>Matthew 20:25-27 says, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave." The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. This is something that is practiced among the unbelievers. Among believers, however, this practice should not be allowed. Whoever wants to become great should be a servant, and whoever wants to be first should be a slave. This is a change in valuation, a change in one's view concerning position. Before a person believes in the Lord, he has high esteem for rulers, and he considers the great ones the heroes. But after he believes in the Lord, he has to consider a servant as a great one, and a slave as a preeminent one. He should despise the position of lords and masters. We should have a change in our concept of position. We should treasure servants and slaves. The concept of value which the Lord put in us is one which exalts and magnifies those who serve the most. The reason there are squabbles for recognition in the church is that worldly concepts have crept in. If everyone in the church regards servants and slaves as great and noble, many of the problems in the church will go away, and the church will be blessed. This does not mean that we want all the new believers to become servants and slaves, but it does mean that a man's concept of value must change when he is saved. He must be willing to be a servant and a slave. He has to be shown clearly that only servants and slaves are great and prominent. The central theme of the Christian faith involves a change in valuation. If every new believer can experience this change in concept, the church will have a free way to go on.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Value of Justice</h2><p>Job 22:23-28 says, "If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up./If you put injustice far away from your tents,/And place your gold nuggets in the dust/And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks,/Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets/And precious silver to you./For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,/And you will lift up your countenance to God./You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;/And you will repay your vows./You will also decree something, and it will be established for you;/And light will shine on your ways." Everything from verse 24 on is based on verse 23. The gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, and the precious silver are all related to the injustice spoken of in verse 23. A man places gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, and precious silver in the dust and in the stones of the brooks for the sake of dealing with injustice and for the sake of delighting oneself in the Almighty. Here again we have a change in valuation. If we are tested at such a critical juncture, and we are asked to choose between gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, the precious silver, and Jehovah, which one will we choose? Such a choice will separate those who are God's from those who are not His. All those who belong to God will surely choose Jehovah as their delight. They will be able to lift up their countenance to God and will be blessed by God in three things. First, their prayers will be heard. Those who prefer gold nuggets, gold of Ophir, and precious silver will find that their prayers are not heard. Second, whatever they decree will be established for them because the Lord Jehovah will delight in their choice and decisions. Third, light will shine on their ways. Every step of their way will be filled with light. This is the result of a change in the concept of value with those who turn to God. Sooner or later we have to help a new believer get out of his old realm; we have to rescue him out of his own concepts. When a situation arises, we have to ask him, "What would you choose?" We have to help him to choose God's justice and to reject the gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, and the precious silver. The value of justice is more than any treasure.</p><h2 class="head2">Between the Enjoyment of Sin<br />and the Unseen Reward</h2><p>Hebrews 11:24-26 speaks of a change in concept of enjoyment and suffering. Moses saw the difference. He saw that all the enjoyment of Egypt was but enjoyment of sin. He considered it great riches to suffer together with the people of God. He was well qualified to have the enjoyment of sin because he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter, the richest and most powerful person on earth. Yet he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. He was very clear about this change in valuation. He was willing to suffer all reproaches and hardships because he saw the significance of that unseen, great reward.</p><h2 class="head2">Between the Knowledge of Christ and All Things</h2><p>Philippians 3:7-8 says, "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ." Here we see that Paul also had a change in his concept of value. What things were gains to him, these he counted as loss on account of Christ. Why was Paul able to reject the things that were gains to him? He was able to consider them as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. He reckoned the Christ whom God had anointed as Lord, as King, and as the most excellent One. For His sake he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse. This is the kind of change in valuation that happens to a Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING OUT THE PRECIOUS FROM THE WORTHLESS<br />TO BE AS GOD'S MOUTH</h2><p>Finally, we want to conclude with the words of Jeremiah 15:19 which tell us that if we bring out the precious from the worthless, we will be as God's mouth. If we cannot tell the proper value of things, God will reject us and cast us aside. He requires that we bring out the precious from the worthless so that we can be His mouth. We have to see the importance of such a change in concept of value. May the Lord grant us the light to have a thorough change in our concept of value so that we will know to choose the most excellent portion.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">DEALING WITH TEMPER</h1><h2 class="head1">SALVATION EFFECTING A CHANGE<br />IN DISPOSITION AND CONDUCT</h2><p>After a man is saved, he should experience a definite change in his disposition as well as in his conduct. Salvation changes us in life, in disposition, and in conduct. The most important change in a believer's disposition and conduct is a change in his temper. The greatest problem many people have before they are saved is their temper. If a man has been a Christian for many years and yet has not experienced any change in his temper, he will lose his testimony before the Gentiles and the church. Under normal circumstances, a man should experience a change in his temper as soon as he is saved.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER MARKS OF A BELIEVER</h2><p>At the time a person is saved, we should tell him that he should have a few marks or signs. The first mark is loving one another. Loving one another is the Lord's charge to His disciples (John 13:34). It should be the strongest mark of a believer. The second mark is meekness. The Lord says that the meek are blessed (Matt. 5:5). He entered Jerusalem on a little colt. This is a mark of His meekness (21:5) and a pattern for us to follow. The third mark is self denial. The Lord said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself" (16:24). A Christian should not try to build up himself. Instead, he should deny himself. The fourth mark is patience. A believer has to learn patience under all kinds of circumstances (1 Cor. 13:7). The fifth mark is to rejoice always. A saved person should not be short in his joy under any circumstance. "Rejoice in the Lord always" (Phil. 4:4). This is a commandment of the Lord. The sixth mark is peace. We have the peace of God, and this peace guards our hearts and thoughts (Phil. 4:7). The seventh mark is lowliness. The Lord says, "I am meek and lowly in heart" (Matt. 11:29). We have to take His yoke and learn from Him. Christ does not remain lofty on high but stoops in lowliness. A worker should tell new believers these seven things and remind them that these are normal expressions of a Christian. Then he should point out that anger and temper are incompatible with the disposition of a Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">TEMPER BEING INCOMPATIBLE<br />WITH A CHRISTIAN CHARACTER</h2><p>Temper is incompatible with the proper Christian expression. It is incompatible with a believer's very disposition. We should realize that where love flourishes, temper cannot remain. The Lord charges us to love everyone, no matter who he is, even if he is our enemy (Matt. 5:44). If we love a person, we will not be angry with him. We cannot love a person and be angry with him at the same time. Temper is contrary to the very nature of love. Our whole Christian life should consist of nothing but love for others; we should not be angry at anyone.</p><p>The Lord also charges us to be meek. He is meek in Himself. The Bible says He is meek and lowly in heart. He renders comfort to others all the time. If a man is meek and his meekness is lived out in his attitude and walk, he will not lose his temper. A man with a temper is a coarse person. Temper is the coarsest of all human sentiments, while love is the finest of all sentiments. Love is expressed in meekness. If a man is meek before God, he surely will not have a quick temper.</p><p>Third, we have to show the new believers that the Lord wants us to deny ourselves. Specifically, denying ourselves means rejecting the self. Denying one's self is not speaking for one's right and learning to endure in all things. No matter how others treat us, we will not be angry. God's children should reject their self and be free from the self. When they are free from the self, temper will be gone. Temper is a mark of those who refuse to deny the self.</p><p>Fourth, we have to show the new ones that one strong Christian characteristic is patience. Patience endures all things. Temper is contrary to patience. It is true that some people treat us unreasonably, but we should always love, and love is not easily provoked. The Lord has arranged various circumstances around us. We should be patient and should not lose our temper easily.</p><p>Fifth, a Christian should rejoice. God has given us a life that rejoices always. It is possible for us to be without a temper. Temper has no place in a Christian's life. Our Christian life should be filled with joy from the very start. This is because the life we have is a joyful life.</p><p>Sixth, a Christian not only has joy but peace as well. Like joy, peace is a part of the life a Christian possesses. Nothing can disturb the peace we have within us. We have to pray that the Lord would guard our hearts and thoughts from any attack. This will keep us from losing our temper.</p><p>Seventh, a Christian is lowly. A child of God should be the most lowly person in the world. Temper and lowliness are incompatible with one another. An angry man is never a lowly man; there is no humility at all within him. God's children should follow the lowly Lord and take the lowly path. They should learn to not lose their temper in anything. We have to say to new ones, "Matthew 5:22 says that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment. Anger and temper are incompatible with a believer's walk." The greatest and most frequent problem a believer faces is his temper. Temper is linked to anger. A new believer should deal with this matter at the beginning of his Christian life. This is the most basic dealing he should experience. Some may ask, "Why is it so crucial to deal with our temper? Why must we solve this problem?" We must deal with this clearly before we can help others. We must settle this issue thoroughly before we can present a straight pathway to the new believers.</p><h2 class="head1">TEMPER NOT A SICKNESS, BUT A SYMPTOM</h2><p>Why does a person lose his temper? Strictly speaking, temper is not a sickness. Among God's children today, temper is a big problem, but the Bible gives very little place to discussion of the temper. The Bible does not pay much attention to the matter of the temper. We have to tell new ones that the Bible does not pay much attention to temper because temper is not a sickness; it is merely a symptom of a sickness. A man may have appendicitis and a high fever. Appendicitis is the sickness, while the fever is the symptom. It is useless to just treat the symptom&mdash;the fever. As soon as one removes the appendix, the fever subsides. We must realize that temper is not a sickness. By the time a man loses his temper, it is too late; his sickness has advanced and is beyond the stage of prevention. Temper is not the cause of the illness. There is a cause to his temper. Unless this cause is removed, there is no way to get rid of the symptom. If we do not realize this truth, we will have a problem with such texts as Romans 6:11. When we lose our temper, we may think of this verse, but it does not do us any good because this verse deals with the root of the sickness, not the symptom. Temper has its root in the self. In order to deal with the temper, we must first deal with the self. Once the self is dealt with, the problem of the temper is solved. In order to deal with the self, we have to deal with the various expressions of the self. Once we take care of the expressions of the self, we have dealt with the self, and subsequently the temper.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH TEMPER&mdash;<br />DEALING WITH THE SELF IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS</h2><h2 class="head2">Subjectivity</h2><p>The first expression of the self is subjectivity. Subjectivity is, in fact, the greatest expression of the self. Many people are very subjective. They always consider themselves as the center; their self is very important to them. If they make up their mind on something, they insist on their idea. They do not quit until they achieve their goal. If others do not agree with them or do not follow their way, they become angry and lose their temper. The root of this temper lies in their subjective will, in the fact that they are not able to carry out their subjective views. If their subjectivity is dealt with, they will say, "Lord, this is Your hand. I have nothing to say." If they surrender this way, they no longer will lose their temper. If everyone is dealt with this way, temper will disappear. No one has a proper perspective of his self when he is angry. If a man's subjectivity is beaten and broken, he spontaneously will be free from his temper.</p><h2 class="head2">Pride</h2><p>The second expression of the self is pride. A proud person does not know himself. Only those who do not know their self see themselves more highly than they should. Those who think highly of themselves and who consider themselves better than, or at least different from, others, do not know the self. A person who is ignorant of his own self and who always thinks highly of himself is a proud person. Proud persons want others to exalt them. They want to see others under them. Such ones never want to give glory to others. They always want others to uplift them. If they meet a man who does not know them and does not acknowledge their superiority, but instead, who criticizes them, they become angry with him. They become angry because their pride is wounded. From this we see that the root of temper is pride. Hence, we have to deal with pride. When we are despised, slandered, mocked, and criticized, we have to learn to say, "Lord, this is your dealing hand. I accept it. Except for Your hand, no one can do this to me." Once a man holds this view, he submits himself to the Lord's hand and denies himself. Spontaneously, his pride will be gone, and his temper will disappear. Once a man kills his pride, his temper will lose its steam.</p><h2 class="head2">Self-love</h2><p>The third expression of the self is self-love. Self-love is love for one's own self. Many people express their self-love subconsciously in the course of their communication with others. A self-loving person only pays attention to himself when he is with others. The most important person is himself. Whatever he does, he regards himself as the center. A self-loving person only pays attention to himself in every necessity of life; he is concerned only for himself. He insists on eating the best food, having the best house, sleeping on the best bed, and using the best utensils. If others have the best food, the most comfortable dwelling, or the best chair, he will feel robbed of his opportunity to pamper his self-love. As a consequence, he will lose his temper. Such a person cannot suffer or be taken advantage of. If others wound his self-love by accident, he becomes very angry. It is useless for a person to deal with temper without also dealing with his self. We should live by the Lord's grace and mercy on this earth rather than by ourselves. If our self is dealt with, we will not lose our temper even under very irritating circumstances. A person whose self is not dealt with can never be free from his temper.</p><h2 class="head2">The Love of Material Things</h2><p>The fourth expression of the self is a love for material things. Some people not only love themselves; they love material things. Such ones are not yet delivered from the material world. For example, some people love food, money, or other things. These things are their idols. If someone breaks a favorite glass by accident or damages their treasures, they become very angry. Their love for material things is wounded. If a man's love for material things is not dealt with, his temper will always remain.</p><p>The fact that a man loses his temper easily has nothing to do with other people; it has to do with himself. Brother Lawrence once slapped his hand on a piece of wood, then on some glass, and then on the wall. He used the same hand to hit three different things, and the sounds produced were all different. He pointed out that the difference in sound was not due to the hand, but to the different kinds of materials hit. The same can be said about man's temper. It does not flare up because of the environment but because of the very nature within man. The environment only brings out the temper that is already within him. If a man does not deal with his self but only tries to deal with his temper, he is a foolish man. He will never be able to deal with his temper because he is only dealing with the symptom of his sickness; he has not touched the root of his temper.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ROOT OF TEMPER</h2><p>We have seen that temper is not an illness but a symptom. Yet from the symptoms, we often can diagnose an illness. If a man loses his temper, it means that there is something abnormal in him. There are four reasons for a Christian to lose his temper. First, a person who refuses the discipline of the Holy Spirit loses his temper. A man with a temper complains and gets angry when he faces adversity. Not only is he short of light from God, but he blames others as well. He will not accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit which is placed in his environment. Second, a person loses his temper because he is dissatisfied with God's arrangement. A man with a temper often is a man who is dissatisfied with his environment. No matter what God does to his environment, he is always dissatisfied. He always wants more. Third, a Christian loses his temper because he only cares for his own things. Some people are quiet by nature. They are only interested in their own things, and they have no interest in others' affairs. Everything they do is for themselves. They have no time for others. When others come, they feel bothered. If their work takes up too much time, they become angry. They cannot stand others' bothering. When others bother them, they condemn them and say that they are infringing on their freedom. Many people lose their temper because they care only for their own things. Hence, we should tell new ones that the root of all temper is the self. Fourth, a man loses his temper because of self-exaltation. Some people become mad and angry as a result of their struggle to exalt themselves. They think that others should not be the same as they are. They want to have everything for themselves and nothing for others. They are always jealous of others, not only in material things but in spiritual things as well. When they see others achieving something, they become jealous and angry. This is a very mean attitude. They have the same kind of feelings as Satan. They rejoice in the fall of those whom they dislike. They are sympathizers of Satan. Such ones are filled with jealousy in their heart. In order to be delivered from their anger, they must remove jealousy from their heart. When a man who knows God is exalted, he rejoices at others' exaltation as well. He will not trample upon others or debase others.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO ACCEPT<br />THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Temper comes from the self. If a man has a temper, it is because his self is not dealt with one way or another. We have to learn to prostrate ourselves before God and be open to His shining. We should consider our own condition. Every day many things come upon us. We should bow our heads and say, "Lord, Your arrangements are always the best." Many cows and sheep are nervous under the hand of their shepherd because they do not know their master; they only see the rod and staff of the shepherd. If we only see the environment without seeing the Lord behind the environment, we will not be at peace, and we will easily lose our temper. But if we see that every situation is in our Shepherd's hand, having been measured by Him, we will be at peace. If we accept the Holy Spirit's discipline and God's arrangements, every negative problem will disappear. When temper tries to flare up, we will isolate the self and find deliverance in the light. In this way we will be able to rise to our feet quickly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TRACTS</h1><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTRIBUTING TRACTS</h2><p>Today we will consider the matter of distributing tracts. First, we have to know the importance of distributing tracts. During the past two or three hundred years, God has used tracts very much to save men. Whether they have been distributed by mail or by hand, tracts have played a very crucial role. In China the practice of tract distribution still is not being carried out properly. In other countries many people have been saved through tracts. But in China many people are still not too clear about the matter of tract distribution. Some realize the importance of this work, but the tracts they use are short of "hooks"; they are not effective. We hope that tract distribution would become a common practice in the church. We have to prepare some effective tracts. We have to charge the new ones with this work so that tract distribution will become a lesson and a training for everyone in the next generation in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BENEFITS OF DISTRIBUTING TRACTS</h2><p>God has used tracts very much to save men. There is something special about tract distribution. We can enumerate the following benefits:</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Limited by Man's Speaking</h2><p>The first advantage of distributing tracts is that they are not limited by man's ability to speak. Many people cannot speak well. They do not have the eloquence or the gift. Others are naturally shy. However, even if a person is slow or shy, he has to open his mouth to testify for the Lord as soon as he is saved. He cannot remain silent just because he says he is not eloquent. The church should encourage the believers and should provide them many opportunities to speak. They have to learn to speak for the Lord. Even those who do not have the gift of speaking should speak for the Lord. Having said this, the truth is that speaking is still a hard task for some people. Either they are short of truth or they are short in experience. Some sinners need to be told the vanity of the world. Some need to be told of how the evil and power of sin robs a person of all peace. Some people need to be told about repentance. Many people do not know what to say when faced with such needs. At these times they can pass out tracts. When a person finds it hard to open his mouth to preach the gospel, tracts become an important tool. A tract distributor must first know about the persons to whom he is giving the tracts. If the receivers are his relatives or friends, he will understand their needs and be able to find the right tract to give to them. If, in addition to the tract, he presents his own testimony, he will have a very good presentation of the gospel. In preaching, it is easy to be affected and restricted by one's own condition. But tract distribution is independent of a man's own personal condition. In fact, many times the tracts speak more clearly and accurately than a man can speak. This is the first advantage of tract distribution. It makes up for a person's lack.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Limited by Age and Status</h2><p>The second advantage of tracts is that they are not limited by the age or status of the receiver. One basic principle in leading men to Christ is for workers to work on the same kind of person as they are. It is unsuitable for a child to work on an old man or for a manual laborer to work on a doctor. One should send an old man to work on an old man, a young man to work on a young man, and a nurse to work on a nurse. Under normal circumstances, one should work within the sphere of his own social rank, sex, and age. For example, it is better, and indeed more appropriate, for sisters to work on ladies. Of course, there are exceptions to this. I am a man, and it would be harder for me to preach to a young lady one-on-one. It is equally embarrassing for a young sister to testify to an old man. Of course, with enough power one can sometimes overcome such barriers. But under normal circumstances, it is difficult to preach to people of different social standing, status, or background. At such times, tracts come in very handy. When you visit a person, you must first pray earnestly. After that you can present a tract to him politely and testify to him. Perhaps you are a new believer. You do not know how or what to say. You only need to give him a tract. This does not mean that you let the tract do all the work. The tract only makes up for your lack; you still have to open your mouth to testify. When there is a gap between the preacher and his listener in rank, age, or sex, and there is some hesitation because of this gap, tracts fill the gap nicely.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Intimidated<br />by Human Factors or the Atmosphere</h2><p>The third advantage of tracts is that they are not intimidated by human factors or the surrounding atmosphere. In large and well-prepared gospel meetings, a preacher can stand on the podium to speak solemnly of such serious subjects as sin and judgment. But when he has to preach to a person one-on-one, politeness, face, and other human factors pose limitations to what can be said. He cannot speak a serious word of warning forthrightly. It is hard to preach under such circumstances. If he points out sin and judgment too bluntly, he may lose a chance to see that person again. In conducting private evangelism, there are certain restrictions and difficulties in speaking what one really wants to speak. But if he gives out a tract which says, "We are all sinners, and we have all sinned before God; we all need Jesus," the other party can more easily receive it. The preacher may not be able to say many things, but he can pray for the other party as he reads the tract and then ask, "Do you feel that you have sinned?" This will not be very offensive. We do not want to offend others when we preach. However, we have to speak directly and honestly. Therefore, when considerations such as status, rank, face, or other human factors stand in the way, we can give tracts and pray. The advantage of a tract is that it is not intimidated by human factors. It is not influenced by the listener, and it speaks only the words of the truth.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Avoiding Much Debate</h2><p>The fourth advantage of tracts is that they avoid much debate. Many times in preaching to others, we fall into debates and arguments. Sometimes we meet a person who likes to argue. He does not have a heart for the gospel; his whole intention is to test us and embarrass us. When we try to testify to him, he tries to argue. We should not debate with him. Instead, we should present a tract to him in a sincere and calm way. This is a very good way of handling the situation. An argumentative person can do nothing to a silent and objective tract. For example, we may meet one of our relatives. He knows that we are Christians, and he may try to argue with us. At such times we should not say too much to him. We should only politely present a tract to him. No matter how much a person likes to argue, he can do nothing with a tract. The best thing to do with such a person is to give him a tract. The next day you can ask, "Have you read the tract I gave you? Do you want another one?" This will avoid any direct confrontational arguments. Of course, we have to pray much for him privately.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Limited by Time and Persons</h2><p>The fifth advantage of tracts is that they are not limited by time and persons. Tracts save men without the limitation of time. In order for a man to preach in person, there is the limitation of time and space as well as audience. A man cannot be in the same place twenty-four hours a day, but a tract is not limited by these factors. Tracts can testify for us beyond any limitation in time. It also is hard for us to testify to total strangers, but tracts can testify anywhere at anytime to anyone. Whether or not we know a person, tracts can testify to him. They are not limited by the kind of person who receives the tract. A man can read a tract at any time. Any time he is free, he can read a tract. If we give a man a tract, it can go where the man goes; it can testify to him anywhere at anytime. This is what makes tracts so convenient.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Being Able to Be Sowed Anywhere</h2><p>The sixth advantage of tracts is that we can sow them anywhere. In Ecclesiastes 11:1 and 6, Solomon said, "Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters....In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not hold back your hands." It is all right to sow randomly, because we do not know which of the seeds we sow will prosper. The apostle Paul said that he who sows with blessings shall reap with blessings (2 Cor. 9:6). In order to sow en mass, there is no better way than tract distribution. Anyone can sow with tracts anywhere. If we have to preach to three, five, or ten persons today, we have to spend much time with them. But it is not a problem to distribute one thousand to two thousand tracts a day. Some brothers have distributed more than one thousand tracts a day for over three years. This is mass sowing. No other method can be as easy as tract distribution when it comes to mass sowing of gospel seeds. No other method is as convenient. Many servants of God love to distribute tracts. They do not even waste their walking time; they seize this opportunity to pass out tracts everywhere. If one person is saved through the tracts that we pass out in one day, we have done a great job already. A new believer has to learn to pass out tracts in bulk. It is a pity if we do not take advantage of tracts effectively.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Enabling All Believers to Function</h2><p>The seventh advantage of tracts is that they enable all believers to function. God has given to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Although not everyone can be an apostle, everyone should do the work of an evangelist. Under normal circumstances, everyone in the church should preach the gospel; everyone should function. Some may say that they do not have the eloquence or the gift. They may say that they cannot sing or preach the gospel. But thank the Lord that everyone can pass out tracts. There is no distinction between tract distributors; a person who receives a tract does not care who he received it from. In preaching the gospel and in giving a testimony, some are more gifted and powerful; their preaching brings more people to the knowledge of salvation. Others are not as gifted and powerful; they bring fewer people to salvation. But tract distribution does not work this way. Whether or not one is gifted or powerful, he can pass out tracts. Whether he is a child or an adult, an educated man or illiterate, he can pass out tracts. The sphere becomes much larger. Anyone can do this as long as he is godly and dedicated. A businessman can invest a few dollars to print some tracts, round up some children, and go out with them to pass out these tracts. His work is different from the work of those preaching from the podium. The work of preaching is limited to a few brothers and sisters, but tract distribution is not restricted by this distinction. Everyone can do it. We have to help the distributors to realize that they have a share in God's service. Their work is a great blessing to the church. In this way their hearts will be drawn to the church, and they will be burdened for the souls of men. No work can be as widespread as the work of tract distribution.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF MEN SAVING OTHERS WITH TRACTS<br />AND BEING SAVED BY TRACTS</h2><p>God has used tracts to save many people. Many people are saved through reading tracts. We can find many such testimonies, and many of them are quite miraculous. I know that some people push tracts into others' homes through the front doors. Some put them in the mail boxes. Some pass out tracts to pedestrians while walking on the street. A pedestrian once took a tract and tore it apart. Another person picked up one of the torn pieces. The torn part spoke of escaping the wrath of the coming judgment. He did not understand what he had read, but he felt uneasy about it. Later he found the way to believe in the Lord, and he was saved. A man once picked up a tract and immediately threw it away. Another person came along the same road. He was hurt by a nail which stuck into his shoe. To relieve his pain, he took the rejected tract, folded it, and put it inside his shoe as a cushion against the nail. When he reached home, he took off his shoes and began to read the tract. His reading brought him to salvation. This is what is meant by casting bread upon the waters. In time it will bear fruit. Such an experience of salvation through tracts is extremely common and even amazing.</p><p>In the last century there was a preacher in England called Tusoney (?). He only had one lung, but he was very powerful in preaching the gospel, and many people were saved through him. He preached the gospel for thirty-seven years. It was a common thing for him to speak to three or four thousand people in open air. He prepared over a hundred different tracts for use in all the villages and towns of England. Some of them were for bigger cities, while others were for smaller villages. Some he used on a train or on a boat. The result of these tracts was quite phenomenal. The tracts for trains alone totaled twenty-two. For example, one tract was entitled: "You Have a Ticket for the Train, but Do You Have Your Tract?" It was used exclusively on trains. Once while he was on a train, as the train was pulling away from the station the conductor asked the passengers, "Do you have a ticket? If you do not have a ticket you cannot get on board." This tract distributor went behind the conductor and said, "Do you have a tract? If you do not have a tract you cannot get on board." On that day, seven people believed in the Lord. He printed the tracts, distributed them himself, and preached with them.</p><p>Mr. George Cutting, the author of the book Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, was very clear about the grace of salvation. His little book ranks second in worldwide circulation, next only to the Bible. In his youth he was also a tract distributor. The Lord used him to write many tracts. He traveled all over England and did his best to save many people. We have to tell the new ones these stories, and we have to encourage them to do the same.</p><p>Another person who belongs in this category is the author of the book A Christian's Rest. His salvation was the result of four people receiving and passing on tracts consecutively. The first one passed a tract to the second, who after being saved, passed another tract to the third. When the third was saved, he passed another tract to the fourth. All four were greatly used by the Lord in England. They were all saved through another one giving them a tract. These tracts resulted in four great servants of the Lord. These examples show us the effectiveness of tracts.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TRACTS</h2><p>After realizing the importance of tract distribution, we have to consider the methods of passing out tracts.</p><h2 class="head2">Ordinary Ways</h2><p>The most common way to pass out tracts is by ordinary day-to-day sowing. In passing out tracts this way, we have to note the following points. First, the tracts must be powerful before God. They must have words that clinch. Tracts that are effective in saving souls should be used again and again. Tracts that are ineffective should be discarded. Tracts that are effective should be reprinted again and again. In passing out tracts on the streets, we should not break local laws. Second, we should pray for God's blessing before setting out so that every tract will carry saving grace with it. Third, when we pass out tracts, we have to pay attention to our attire and expressions. Our dress has to be proper; it must match our status. We should neither be too modern nor too modest; our clothes must be proper. Moreover, we have to be very polite. If we are reaching middle-class people, we should dress like a middle-class person. Fourth, in passing out tracts, we should be sincere and sober in our attitude. Do not be flippant or light. Do not act like the street hawkers, and do not behave rashly. In giving out a tract, hold it out with your left hand, bow or nod at others, and then present it to them. If they accept it, give them another acknowledging bow or nod.</p><p>If a person refuses a tract, we should not become angry. If he throws it away, we can pick it up again. If he turns around and reviles us, we should not argue with him. We can do the following: 1) let him go; 2) send him away politely; 3) try to convince him with a few words; or 4) pick up the tract again and pray for the tract.</p><p>If possible, the church should pray often for the work of tract distribution. We should pray that the Lord would give us more fruit. In order to get more fruit, we have to persevere in prayer. We have to pray 1) that God would bless those who receive the tracts; 2) that God would not allow the tracts to be destroyed; 3) that God would allow the tracts to be passed along; 4) that God would save everyone whose hand has touched the tract; and 5) that God would extend the days of the tracts.</p><h2 class="head2">Special Ways</h2><p>The second way to pass out tracts is more special. The ordinary way is non-systematic; this distribution is done anywhere and everywhere. Special distribution is distribution according to a plan. We can group our people by teams and distribute tracts door to door along each street. In order to carry out this way of distribution, we must first divide ourselves into teams. We can put two brothers in a team or two sisters in a team. We can assign a street or highway to them. After the team assignment, we can tell them to give one tract to each household. Next we pray for the tracts. We should seek for an opening word with which to speak to others. We should also seek to know how long we should wait before visiting the same neighborhood again. Tract distributors should commit themselves to go out once every other day or once every three days or four days. At least they should go out once a week. At the assigned time, they should divide up the tracts according to the questions the tracts address and distribute them to each person according to need. Finally, they have to pray for blessing.</p><p>In passing out tracts, there are a few things to remember. First, we should find the name of each household from the telephone book. We should write the name of each household on an envelope and send out the tracts in the envelope. Second, we should deliver tracts to some people in person. Third, in mailing tracts, we should write the names and addresses legibly and drop the mail in the mailbox. In passing out tracts, others may ask what we are doing. We can tell them that we are delivering the glorious gospel of the Son of God to them. Some methods have been used in other parts of the world with great success. Many times entire households have been saved. Fourth, we can take a street or a district as a unit and ask some brothers and sisters to be responsible for distribution along that street or in that district. This is also a very good way.</p><h2 class="head2">Personal Distribution</h2><p>Another way of distribution is the personal way. The personal way targets our relatives and friends. Sometimes it is hard to preach the gospel to our relatives and friends. But it is easier to give them a tract. We have to be careful in choosing the tracts we give. We must consider the condition of every case. We can show some people how sin has damaged them. We can show others how money and vainglory cannot satisfy. We have to pray for them and bless them. In presenting tracts to them, we have to be serious and polite. We have to say, "There are many things which I cannot say, and there are many things which I myself do not know. But I would like to give this tract to you. Please read it." After returning home, we should pray for them and ask God to bless them and to make the tract fruitful. In this way, it will be easy for us to spread the gospel to our friends and relatives.</p><h2 class="head1">OTHER MATTERS</h2><p>If we are faithful in carrying out this burden, we will soon find that our tracts are very inadequate. Although some tracts are small, they are very effective in saving people. These tracts should be reprinted again and again. Our tracts should not be for looks only. They have to have words that catch men. These are the useful words. The language and content of the tract have to be clear and direct; there must not be any misspelled words. If there is a misspelled word in a tract, it may lose its effectiveness. In writing tracts, we have to be very careful. No one can be careless in the work of God.</p><p>In preaching the gospel, we have to learn to speak the right words to the right people. In distributing tracts, we have to do the same, giving the right people the right kind of tracts. For example, if you give a worldly person a tract about the vanity of the world, his chance of getting saved will be great. Some people have had contact with the church already; a tract explaining the depth of the Lord's grace may be very effective in bringing about their salvation. (One becomes conscious of sin only after he has believed. If we talk to an uninterested person about sin, we may offend him.) The most direct approach to ordinary worldly people is to speak to them about the vanity of the world. This will easily bring them to salvation.</p><p>We must carry tracts in our pocket all the time, like carrying our business cards. As soon as we meet a person, we should give him a tract. Sometimes it is hard to open our mouth. A tract can take the place of our speaking, and others will not feel too much imposition. Some people like to ramble about scurrilous things as soon as they sit down. A tract will shut their mouths and even give us a chance to open our mouth. When we present a tract to them, we can say a few words or we can say nothing at all. If we practice this faithfully, the Lord will save many people.</p><p>Finally, we have to remember that while we are the ones who are passing out the tracts, we cannot depend on ourselves. We should not think that we can save anyone. We have to trust in the Spirit of God. Whenever we pass out a tract, we have to pray that the Lord will bless the receiver of the tract. We have to ask God's Spirit to save men through these tracts.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">FORGIVING OUR BROTHER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 18:21-35</h1><p>Today we will consider the matter of offense and forgiveness among Christians. After we have believed in the Lord, we have to settle one question: What should we do when a brother has sinned against us? In Matthew 18:21-22 the Lord Jesus told us that if a brother sins against us, we must not only forgive him once but seventy times seven times.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S FORGIVENESS BEING UNLIMITED</h2><p>Matthew 18:21 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" It is to our advantage that Peter asked this question. Although his spirit was wrong, his question helps us to clarify the matter of forgiveness. The Lord seemed to be saying, "You have asked how many times you should forgive a brother who has sinned against you. You should have asked instead how many times you should be forgiven when you sin against God." If God said, "I will forgive you seven times," this would be a very low standard indeed.</p><p>When we sin against God, His feeling is hurt. Yet our feeling is not that strong. When others sin against us, our feelings are hurt, and it is hard for us to let it go. Yet God is love, and love does not seek for its own gain. Although God is hurt, His forgiving grace is unlimited. Peter's question shows that he was seeking for his own gain. He suffered because he was hurt. The price he had to pay for forgiving others was himself, that is, the suffering of being hurt. This is the reason he asked the Lord, "How often shall others sin against me and I forgive them? Up to seven times?" Peter said this to show that he was quite magnanimous. Two or three times would have been enough to him, but he made it seven times. There was, however, something wrong with his basic premise. He thought God's grace is limited. The fact is that God's grace has no bounds; it is unlimited. It follows that the forgiveness which God's children practice should also be unlimited.</p><p>In Luke 17:3-4 the Lord said to the disciples, "If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him." After the Lord spoke, the disciples followed with a prayer asking the Lord to increase their faith. They found it hard to believe in the Lord's word. They felt that it was hard to believe that a brother could sin against another seven times a day and then repent seven times. They thought that it was inconceivable that such a one could be forgiven. Hence, they said, "Increase our faith." Under such circumstances, God's children should still forgive. Whether or not those who ask for forgiveness are genuine is not our concern. As long as a man asks for forgiveness, we should forgive him. Matthew says that we should forgive our brothers not only seven times, but seventy times seven times. Luke says that if a brother sins against us seven times a day and then repents, we have to forgive him irrespective of his motive. Whether or not his repentance is genuine, we have to forgive him. As long as he comes to us, we have to forgive him. In Matthew, Peter's conversation omitted the words "in a day" and somewhat changed the meaning. Luke speaks of the same incident related to the same person, but he speaks of a man sinning seven times in a day, repenting, and then being forgiven. Peter changed the same story around. He asked the Lord if it was enough to forgive seven times. By framing the question this way, he made love, grace, and forgiveness all qualities that are limited in nature. In Luke 17 the Lord indicates that love, grace, and forgiveness are all unlimited in nature. Peter's question in Matthew 18 made love, grace, and forgiveness all limited in nature.</p><p>The Lord Jesus realized that Peter had changed the wording of the question. His answer about forgiving one's brother revealed that this was not a matter of sufficiency. It was not a question of seven times, but of seventy times seven. God's love, grace, and forgiveness are unlimited. Humanly speaking, thirty-five times of forgiveness would stretch a person to his limit. Seventy times seven is something beyond the reach of human power. It is too heavy a burden. This shows us that the power to forgive is something beyond man. At the same time, those who receive forgiveness are not receiving it from man. They receive forgiveness from another power. Matthew 18:22 says, "Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven." The Lord indictes that forgiveness has nothing to do with the number of times one forgives. If anyone wants a number, let it be seventy times seven.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S MEASURE</h2><p>After He answered Peter, the Lord went on with a parable in verses 23 through 27: "For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves. And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made. Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all. And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan." The kingdom of the heavens refers to God's rule on earth. It is like an earthly king ruling over a kingdom. Ten thousand talents equal approximately three hundred thousand taels of gold. This signifies that the slave owed his master an incalculably great debt. He did not have the means to repay because he did not have anything with which to repay his master. His house was empty, and he was destitute. Here the Lord shows us that a sinner's debt far exceeds what he can repay. Those who cannot forgive others do not realize the forgiveness that they have received. The debt that we owe God can never be repaid. The debt we owe God is too great in comparison to the debt that others owe us. If God's children have a right evaluation of their debt to God, they will be generous in their forgiving of their brothers.</p><p>Those who do not realize the depth of the grace they have received are prone to be short in grace themselves. We have to see the immensity of the debt we owe God before we can see the trivialness of the debt others owe us. In this parable, the master, finding that the debtor did not have anything, ordered all that he had to be sold. Actually, even if the debtor had sold all that he had, he still would not have been able to repay his debt. A sinner is judged in this world as well as in the eternal age to come. This is what it means to have all of one's possessions sold. In verse 26 the slave pleaded with the master on his knees, saying, "Be patient with me and I will repay you all." It is hard for man to know what grace is and what the gospel is. Man thinks that he may not be able to make it today, but that he will make it some day. He may not be able to fulfill the requirements today, but he will fulfill them some day. He thinks that his motive is good and that he does not have any intention of procrastinating on his repayment. Yet he does not know anything about grace. He pleads with the Lord, not for mercy but for time. He pleads for the Lord's patience but has no thought of His forgiveness.</p><p>Here we see two things. The first is the virtue of the slave, and the second is his shortcoming. His virtue was to ask for patience from the Lord. He was looking for grace through righteousness. But God begins to dispense grace only when man stops speaking to Him in terms of righteousness. It is always right for man to come to God and seek for grace. Even before a man comes under the shining of the gospel and sees his true condition, God is pleased to hear him plead for grace, and He is willing to grant grace gladly. Anyone who feels that he is indebted to God and who seeks grace will find favor in His eyes. This is the virtue of the slave. His shortcoming is that he did not know enough of his sin and indebtedness. He said that he would repay, but the very thought of a repayment is wrong. He forgot that he owed ten thousand talents. He did not see the seriousness of his own sin. This is the reason he was not able to forgive those who owed him. He did not realize his pitiful situation. Therefore, he spoke of repayment. He would not be able to repay within his lifetime. In fact, he would not be able to repay in ten lifetimes. When a man is saved, his feeling for sin is not too acute. He is not clear why he is sinful, and he does not know the depths of his depravity.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD FORGIVING MAN<br />ACCORDING TO HIS ABOUNDING MEASURE,<br />NOT ACCORDING TO A SINNER'S NEED</h2><p>Nevertheless, the slave was willing to ask for the master's leniency. As soon as he asked, the master was moved with compassion. He was merciful to him and forgave his debts. When a master forgives and releases a slave, his intention is not for the slave to earn money to repay him but for him to be free. What God does in man far exceeds man's requests and prayer. The slave only asked for patience, but the Lord was moved with compassion and forgave him all his debts. The Lord acts according to what He has. He answers our prayer according to what He has. The gospel is God granting salvation to man according to His own pleasure; it is God bestowing His abundant mercy and forgiveness upon the sinner. God acts according to His abounding measure, not according to the sinner's need. The robber on the cross prayed to the Lord, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." The Lord immediately replied, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:42-43). Salvation is God saving men according to His own mind and His own riches. As far as propriety was concerned, the prayer of the robber who was crucified with the Lord was inappropriate, but he received God's grace just the same. The Lord does not save sinners according to their thoughts. His measure of forgiveness is according to His own riches, not according to man's need.</p><p>The Bible shows us a tax collector praying to God in the temple. He beat his breast and said, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" (Luke 18:13). The tax collector knew that he was a sinner, and he asked God for mercy. His only plea was for mercy. Mercy, however, is only the starting point of God's work, not its consummation. The Lord likes to be asked to spend Himself. The man only asked for God to be propitiated to him. God heard his prayer, but He did not answer him according to his prayer. Instead, He said, "This man went down to his house justified..." (v. 14). In other words, the man went home justified. God looked at him as if he had not sinned; He considered him righteous. This was far more than what the sinner prayed for.</p><p>There is another example in the Bible&mdash;the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15. When the prodigal son was away in a far country, he prepared to go home and say to his father, "I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" (vv. 18-19). He merely thought of convincing his father to grant him the grace to return home. He would have been satisfied to be treated as a hired servant. He dared not hope for his father to spend anything on him again. When he reached home, he only was able to say half of what he had prepared. His father fell on his neck, kissed him affectionately, and would not allow him to go on with his speech. He ordered the slaves to bring out the best things for his son (vv. 20-24). We often pray in a poor way, but God's answer is beyond what we ask or think. The gospel is God working to His own satisfaction. Whether or not man prays enough, God sheds His rich grace and mercy, not to the sinner's satisfaction, but to His own satisfaction.</p><p>The fourth example is found in Mark 2. Here we are told that four men carried a paralytic to the Lord Jesus, hoping to find healing. Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where the Lord was and lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying. The Lord told the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven" (vv. 1-5). The man was seeking for healing, but the Lord did more than heal him. He forgave his sins. The paralytic was healed, and the sin which brought about his sickness was forgiven. God grants us much grace according to His own knowledge. The paralytic did not have enough knowledge of grace, but his very thought of securing some gain from God earned him God's favor. Nothing glorifies God more and nothing pleases Him more than giving Him the opportunity to dispense His grace. Ten thousand talents may be a debt which cannot be repaid in ten generations. God's forgiveness, however, is far greater than this debt.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF GOD'S<br />RICH GRACE OF FORGIVENESS&mdash;<br />PARTAKING OF HIS NATURE</h2><p>Matthew 18:28-30 goes on to show us the goal of God's work on such a man. There is much grace involved. A person who has been forgiven by God should at least have a little of God's nature. He should have an inclination for generosity and a tinge of the Lord's image. Yet this slave learned nothing after experiencing so much grace; he did not have a taste of the generosity of grace. In verse 27 he was forgiven, and he should have been rejoicing. Yet when he met his companion, he went after the hundred denarii (worth about three-tenths of a tael of gold) which was owed to him. He owed his master about three hundred thousand taels of gold. He was owed only a millionth of what he owed his master, yet he took hold of the other person and choked him, saying, "Repay me what you owe." In verse 22 the Lord wanted to show Peter that the matter of forgiveness is a matter of the spirit. If we are filled with a sense of forgiveness and the joy of grace when we are saved, we will be more than happy to forgive others. Peter's word exposed one problem&mdash;he did not realize that he had been forgiven. He did not have the feeling of being forgiven. This is the reason he could not forgive. If we are filled with the feeling of being forgiven, we will not say such things as "seven times." Peter's mind was on the number seven. This is the reason the Lord purposely spoke of ten thousand talents and one hundred denarii in verses 24 and 28. The difference between these two is a million times. The Lord seemed to be saying, "God's forgiveness cannot be measured by numbers. If you want numbers, you owe the Lord a million times more than what others owe you." A man who is good at accounting is one who is poor at reckoning grace. A man will not forgive because he does not have a sense of being forgiven; he does not have a feeling that he has been graced.</p><p>The one who was threatened with the demand to repay his debt fell down and begged the slave, "Be patient with me and I will repay you." His prayer and request was the same as the slave's request. Yet the grace which was shown to the slave did not effect a compassion in him for the man's need. He tried to throw him into prison until he repaid what he owed. Here we have three persons&mdash;two are debtors and two are creditors. The Lord showed that the second person was both a debtor and a creditor. The first creditor was concerned only with grace, not righteousness. The second creditor was concerned only with righteousness, not grace. This should be condemned. When he was a debtor, he hoped for grace. Once he became a creditor, he acted according to righteousness. When he was a debtor, he looked for forgiveness. Once he became a creditor, he granted no forgiveness at all. This is unreasonable. The Lord showed Peter his own sin. He showed Peter the immensity of the forgiveness he had received. Peter omitted the words "in a day"! This is unreasonable! What the other slave owed was only one hundred denarii (three-tenths of a tael of gold). It was such a small sum. Yet he was put into prison. How "righteous" was the first slave! He wanted others to be gracious to him, yet he would not be gracious to others. Was he wrong? Should his companion have repaid him? Of course, he was right, and there was nothing wrong in putting his companion into prison for failing to repay him. It was righteous for his companion to be put into prison, but he had just received grace from another. He had just tasted the experience of grace. It was wrong for him to do such a thing; it should be condemned. We have been forgiven of our sins. If we do not forgive others, how much will we be judged?</p><h2 class="head1">FORGIVING OTHERS AS THE LORD HAS FORGIVEN US</h2><p>At the beginning of verse 31 the Lord said, "Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved." The Lord asked the other slaves to come forth to say a word. If a forgiven person will not forgive another, even the church will be grieved by such an act. The whole church knows that this is wrong. Everyone was grieved and came and explained this to the master. The master called the slave in and said, "Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?" (vv. 32-33). Among the brothers we should only speak of forgiveness, not of righteousness. We should only speak of mercy, not of repayment. We have to learn not to offend others or to take advantage of them. We have to learn to do our best to share grace with others. The Lord has been gracious to us with good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. We have received so much grace. We should be gracious to others, also with good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. The church should be filled with forgiveness. The Lord forgives us for two reasons. One is to absolve our debt, and the other is to give us the power to absolve others' debt. Should we not be merciful to our companions? Everyone who has received mercy should be merciful to others. The Lord expects us to treat others in the same way He treats us. Colossians 3:13 says, "Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive." Among God's children, we should never quibble according to righteousness. God has not reckoned our account with us; we should never reckon others' account with them.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS</h2><p>Matthew 18:34 says, "And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed." This verse means that the Lord delivers a man to God's governmental hand until he repays all that is owed. In terms of spiritual significance, repayment means forgiveness. Being delivered to the torturers means being delivered to God's governmental hand. God wants us to be filled with the spirit of forgiveness. This is the reason that verse 35 immediately follows, saying, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts." This means that God wants us to be filled continually with a spirit of forgiveness. We have to forgive our brothers from our heart. What does it mean to forgive the brothers from the heart? If our brother owes us a hundred denarii, and we feel awkward in forgiving his debt, it means that we do not know God. We have been forgiven of a ten thousand talent debt. We should not be bound by a hundred denarii. We have received mercy from God. He has graced us with a generous and unmatched forgiveness, and He has created a generous and unmatched heart of forgiveness in us. This enables us to forgive our brothers from the heart. If a spirit of pettiness and calculation abounds in a church, trouble will increase in that church. We should submit to God's authority. His kingdom is full of the spirit of forgiveness. If we do not practice this, the church will be full of problems. May the spirit of forgiveness fill the church. May brotherly love fill the church. How glorious such a church will be!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A CHRISTIAN AND HIS COUNTRY</h1><p>After a person is saved, he has to deal with the matter of his country. Although this is a secular issue, it is very important to the individual walk of a Christian. How should a Christian deal with his country? A new believer has to take care of this matter properly in order not to err in his walk.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S POSITION ON EARTH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Lord Not Coming<br />to Enforce the Law</h2><p>When our Lord was on the earth, He maintained His position wherever He went. He never acted as a law enforcer. He never tried to enforce any law, whether civil or criminal. The Gospel of Luke tells us of two brothers who came to the Lord for help in dividing their possessions, but the Lord refused to do it (12:13-14). The Old Testament does contain commandments for dividing the house. The Lord was not forbidding them from dividing their house. But it was not a matter of whether or not the act was justified, but whether it was right for the Lord to do it. He did not come to judge family affairs. In John 8:3-11 the Pharisees brought before the Lord a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They wanted the Lord to condemn her to death. They asked, "In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do you say?" The Lord stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger. When they kept pressing Him, He stood up and said, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." When they heard this, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. The Lord then said to the woman, "Has no one condemned you?...Neither do I condemn you." The Lord was not saying that the woman should not be condemned. Rather, He was showing that He did not come to condemn. He did not come to execute the law, civil or criminal. This was not His concern. This was the position the Lord took when He was on the earth. He was always firm in this position.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Nothing to Do<br />with Politics</h2><p>When the Lord was on the earth, He was very meek. He did not seek the greatness of this world. The Jews hoped that He would be their king, but He ignored this wish. He did not touch the matter of politics at all. Catholicism has mixed itself up with politics completely. The edicts of popes are often political maneuvers. Our Lord never touched politics. When He was on the earth, many Jews were ready to die for Him if He would only agree to be their king. But the Lord would not be their king. This does not mean that He did not have the power to reform the political system or to save the Jewish nation. His goal on earth was to save sinners. His work was spiritual, not worldly; it had nothing to do with politics.</p><p>The Lord did not enter Jerusalem on a fine horse in great pomp. He came on a colt in humility. The Jews wanted to kill Him because He claimed to be the Son of God. If He had proclaimed Himself the king of the Jews, the Jews would not have killed Him. Before He was crucified, He was judged twice. One of these times the high priest said, "I charge You...to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God." Jesus answered, "You have said rightly," and the high priest condemned Him based on this word (Matt. 26:63-66). Since the high priest did not have the authority to put the Lord Jesus to death, he handed Him to Pilate who asked, "Are You the king of the Jews?" (27:11). Pilate was not concerned about whether or not He was the Son of God. His fear was political. He was afraid that the Jews would make Jesus their king. The interesting thing is that no one knew who the Lord was. No one knew if He was indeed a politically controversial figure. For two thousand years the world has been puzzled by Christianity in the same way. Some have said that Christianity has been used by some as a religious tool to achieve political ends. When the Lord Jesus was condemned, His verdict, written in three languages, read: "This is the king of the Jews." But the world does not understand that the Lord had no interest in politics. He said that His kingdom was not of this world. This means that the kingdom of the Lord is not within the political arena but apart from it. This is the position our Lord took.</p><p>In Psalm 110:1 the Father says to the Son, "Sit at My right hand/Until I make Your enemies/Your footstool." During the age of grace, our Lord does not take charge directly of the affairs of this world. He is waiting for the day when God makes His enemies His footstool. Hebrews 12:28 and Acts 14:22 clearly tell us that the kingdom we have received is God's kingdom; it has nothing to do with politics. God has established a kingdom in grace. This kingdom includes many nations of this world. His people enter this kingdom through regeneration. This kingdom does not have any territory, army, or politics. In this kingdom there is only God's rule to govern man's conduct. This kingdom is called the kingdom of the heavens. The position of this kingdom is heavenly. The Lord is not behind any nation on this earth. He has set up a spiritual kingdom to rule over His people. When He comes again, His authority will fill the whole earth (Dan. 2:35). Out of His mouth will come a sharp two-edged sword, which is His living word. This sword will smite the nations (Rev. 19:15). (At this time the prayer of the robber who was crucified with the Lord will be answered, who prayed for remembrance at the time of the coming of the Lord in His kingdom&mdash;Luke 23:42.)</p><p>Revelation 6:9 says that when the fifth seal was opened, the souls of those who were martyred for God's word and the testimony of Jesus would cry to the Lord. Their prayers were for God's interest and kingdom. We should follow their footsteps and refrain from political involvement. We should not fall prey to political agendas. Our purpose on earth is to advance God's heavenly kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">A CHRISTIAN'S POSITION ON EARTH</h2><h2 class="head2">In the Kingdom of His Beloved&mdash;<br />Being Heavenly Citizens</h2><p>Just as Christ maintained His position on earth, a Christian should do the same. Christians should not organize political activities, nor should they take advantage of the political system. Everything the Lord avoided in this world should be avoided by Christians, and everything that the Lord partook of in this world should be shared by Christians. We should be the same as He. This is the Christian position. In John 18:36 the Lord said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling..." Following this the Lord said, "My kingdom is not from here." His attendants need not struggle, because He was not establishing any earthly rule. In Colossians 1:13 Paul said, "Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love." He has saved us and delivered us into another kingdom. This kingdom is not concerned with any politics; it is the kingdom of God's Beloved. The kingdom to which a Christian belongs is spiritual; it is in life and has nothing to do with politics or religion.</p><p>Philippians 3:20 says, "For our commonwealth exists in the heavens." What position should a believer take? Paul said that we are citizens of heaven. In ancient times there were two kinds of citizens in the Roman Empire. Some were Roman citizens, and others were subjects of the empire. Roman citizens enjoyed many rights. They had the right to vote and be elected. They could enjoy all the privileges that the empire provided. The subjects, however, did not have that much right. They were only subordinate vassals in the Roman empire. This is the reason they were called the subjects. We are heavenly citizens; our kingdom is in the heavens. On earth we are pilgrims and sojourners. Although our earthly country recognizes our rights, these rights merely mean that we agree to abide as lawful citizens of our state. We have no intention of involving ourselves in politics. Strictly speaking, every believer is a foreigner within his own country. The kingdom to which the believers belong has citizens, but no territory. It has commandments, but no constitution. It has love, but no army. At the end of Mark the Lord said to the disciples, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation" (16:15). This proves that they were not men belonging to earthly nations; their position was basically heavenly. Today God's children are in the world just as Moses was in Midian and the Israelites were in Egypt; they were all pilgrims. We should do our best to make peace with men, to help them, and to lead them to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Standing Apart from Politics</h2><p>A Christian stands apart from all kinds of politics. For two thousand years God's children have been citizens of the heavenly kingdom. They never enjoy being involved with earthly things. They are reluctant even to vote. They do not like to touch worldly politics. A British brother once said that he had been a believer for sixty years but had never known what voting was. The Lord always stood apart from all the nations of the earth. We should do the same. If we live in the spiritual kingdom, we will realize that all the activities of the Roman Catholic Church are wrong. At the time Paul fulfilled his ministry, there were many believers everywhere. Communication was frequent, and the number of believers great. (It was said that if the Roman Empire killed all the Christians in Rome, there would not have been many people left in the city.) However, the apostles did not capitalize on this fact. They did not organize the believers together to engage in politics. They did not utilize the Christian community to gain power politically. Martin Luther realized the mistake of Catholicism and suggested dissociating the church from political influence. In Acts 21:38, when Paul was tried, the commander asked, "You are not then the Egyptian who some days ago revolted and led out the four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?" The Romans did not understand what Paul was doing. They thought that a man with such a great following would surely have political motives. Roman Catholicism wields its political power from its numbers. Today's Christians should return to Paul's position; they should stand apart from all politics.</p><h2 class="head1">A CHRISTIAN'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS<br />THE STATE AND THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Becoming Rulers</h2><p>A Christian should not be a ruler on this earth. A Christian should have only one goal, which is to maintain his spiritual walk and to uphold God's grace in this age. The Lord shows us through His commandments that a Christian should act in grace, not according to righteousness. The Lord wants Christians to deal with everything according to grace, not according to righteousness. If anyone slaps our right cheek, we should turn our left cheek to him. This means that we cannot be a politician or ruler. Our life reacts according to the principle of grace, not according to the principle of righteousness. This disqualifies us from becoming a ruler. A ruler must uphold the principle of righteousness among men. But as soon as a man insists on righteousness, he cannot be a Christian because a Christian is one who upholds grace. The Christian way of reacting in the realm of politics disqualifies him from holding any public office, high or low. Yet a Christian must recognize the political authority God has established. A Christian does not believe in anarchism. Genesis 9:6 says, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." A Christian believes in the death penalty, but he will never be an executioner. A Christian believes that nations should be ruled by governments, but he will never be a governor. Worldly people react according to the principle of righteousness, but Christians react according to the principle of grace. The Lord's commandment is that we turn the left cheek to those who slap us on the right cheek, yield our cloak to those who take our tunic, and walk an extra mile with those who compel us to walk one mile (Matt. 5:39-41). This is the Christian's reaction to people of the world. This does not mean that everyone in the world has to act the same way, yielding the left cheek when the right cheek is slapped, yielding a cloak when asked for a tunic, and going an extra mile when compelled to go one. But a Christian has to act this way. The world reacts by returning an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and blood for blood. This is absolutely contrary to a Christian's way of reacting. We do not believe, nor do we preach shedding blood for blood, but we know that very few Christians are willing to live according to the position on the mountain. We have to live according to the Sermon on the Mount, but we should not apply it to the world.</p><p>We must be clear about our attitude on this earth. We believe in government, and we support government. Christians, however, are not worthy of the world; we are a different race. We suffer willingly in order to bring the world blessing. However, our message is not our suffering but our gospel. Some suffer voluntarily, but that is a matter of their own choice. We have to tell the new ones that in this age, when the Lord is in heaven, we have to suffer willingly on earth. In 1 Corinthians 4:9 Paul said, "God has set forth us the apostles last of all as doomed to death." It is unnatural for Christians to assume authority or rulership on earth today. In the Old Testament Daniel and Esther reigned in foreign lands, but they did so at a time when the nation of Israel was destroyed. Under normal circumstances, a Jewish girl cannot be married to a Gentile, and even if she is married to a Gentile, she cannot be a queen. If she is, she may be stoned. Who would dare say that the kingdom of the heavens has been destroyed today, and that we are therefore justified in taking up governmental positions in China? We should never touch the politics of this age. In particular we should never be ruling authorities. If we are ordinary citizens, we have God's Word to guide us, even if we are citizens of India. But if we are rulers, there is no word to sanction our stand; we can only say that we want to do this ourselves. No Christian should be a ruler in this age.</p><h2 class="head2">Doing Our Best to Submit to Earthly Government</h2><p>A Christian should not be the ruler of a nation, but he should do his best to submit to earthly government. Romans 13:1-7 says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God. So then he who resists the authority...will receive judgment to themselves....Fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due." You have to read these words to the new believers. Our way is to teach every person to be subject to the authority over him. This is our stand. We do not assume authority; rather, we want others to assume authority so that we ourselves can submit to authority. We believe that the authority of all earthly government is from God. As far as the principle of authority goes, all rulers are appointed by God. God arranges all the things on this earth, and the authorities which exist are ordained by God. He who resists authority opposes God's ordination. We have to learn to submit to all authority, whether great or small. We cannot oppose any authority. On the one hand, believers should not touch any politics. On the other hand, they should submit to all political powers. In this world God has entrusted authority to man. Anyone who opposes authority is opposing God's ordination. Those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves. Verse 4 says that those who are in authority are servants of God and are there for our good. They do not bear the sword in vain. Authority is established by God. We submit to them because they punish evil. Even when some punish the good and reward the evil in practice, they at least will claim in name that they are punishing the evil and rewarding the good. They can only be false in their conduct; they can never be false in their principle. In principle, all authority established by God punishes evil and rewards good.</p><p>Verse 5 says, "Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience." Wrath is from man, while the sense in our conscience is from God. If we do not submit, our conscience immediately bothers us. We also will come under wrath. We have to be obedient in the matter of taxation. Whatever the government orders us to pay materially, we have to obey. God has appointed earthly governments to take charge of earthly affairs. We should pay our taxes to support the government in all its expenditures (v. 6). In verse 7 we are given clear injunctions concerning our attitude in such matters. In summary, "Render to all the things due: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due." This is the basic commandment that the Lord has given us. We have to do our best to uphold this.</p><h2 class="head2">The Extent to Which a Christian<br />Should Submit to Earthly Government</h2><p>However, there is a limit to our submission. Should we obey all ordinances? We cannot pledge unqualified obedience to every ordinance of a government. We can only obey every party under God with qualifications. Only God is the object of our unqualified submission. If the law of a state clearly contradicts God's commandment, we cannot obey it. In Exodus Pharaoh ordered the midwives to kill all the male babies born of Hebrew women. Moses' mother and the midwife kept Moses out of their fear of Jehovah. The book of Hebrews praises them as examples of faith (11:23). In every circumstance we have to obey God's commandment. Daniel's three friends would not worship the image. Although they violated the king's order, God was pleased with them. They would not follow the order to worship the image, even when their lives were threatened with death. Darius forbade the people to pray to any of their gods. After Daniel found out about this law, he continued to pray with his face towards Jerusalem three times a day. In the end he was thrown into the lions' den, but God shut up the mouth of the lions. When a Christian is confronted by laws that contradict God's commandment, his only choice is to sacrifice himself; he has no other choice. In Matthew 2:13-14 Herod ordered all the babies under two years old be killed. Joseph could only run to Egypt with the child and His mother.</p><p>In Acts 5:29, when the Jewish elders and High Priest forbade the apostles from teaching in the name of the Lord, they replied, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." Our obedience to men cannot go beyond our obedience to God. This word referred to the Jewish government. Sometimes we can only obey God, not men. Romans 13:1 says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over him." We have two things: submission and obedience. One is a matter of attitude while the other is a matter of conduct. Romans speaks of the attitude, while Peter spoke of the conduct. It is wrong to obey men more than to obey God. In our attitude we should be absolute in submission to those in authority, but in conduct, our obedience is relative. Submission is absolute, while obedience is relative. If your father wants you to do something, you can refuse him. This is to disobey. In our attitude, however, we still have to be submissive. Christians should always be submissive in their attitude towards the government. But we cannot fully obey those laws that are in direct contradiction against God's commandments.</p><h2 class="head2">Christians Not Engaging in Revolutions<br />for Themselves</h2><p>A Christian must not engage in any revolution to advance his own cause. Our obedience is conditional, but our submission is unconditional. Our submission to God is unconditional, and our obedience to Him is also unconditional. While our submission to men is also unconditional, our obedience to them is conditional. We cannot oppose the government just because it touches our faith or persecutes us for its sake. Although we cannot obey it, we should still submit to our government unconditionally. We must never engage in any revolution for ourselves. Christians are basically men who stand for submission. We do not engage in revolutions. Except in matters related to our faith, Christians obey the government in everything. Today the Christian responsibility is to preach the gospel, to save sinners, and to satisfy man's spiritual needs. The world has its physical and psychological needs, and we must leave it to the worldly people to satisfy these needs. We live only for the spiritual things on earth. We do not fight or struggle. Except in matters related to faith, we should obey all governmental authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Christians Not Engaging in War</h2><p>There is a basic difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament in the matter of going to war. The Old Testament shows us that God is a God of warfare. He ordained that there would be war in Canaan. We cannot say that war is altogether wrong. However, in the New Testament we are made ambassadors of peace. In this age the Lord does not go to war. He says, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews" (John 18:36). In the garden of Gethsemane, Judas came with men to take the Lord. Peter took out his sword and cut off the right ear of one of the servants of the high priest. The Lord told him, "Put the sword into its sheath" (vv. 10-11). Our Lord does not call us to war. We have to remember that the goal of God's work is peace. The proper place of a Christian's sword is the sheath. Some have argued that the Lord once told us to buy swords. In Luke 22:35-38 the Lord said to the disciples, "When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" This was what the Lord told them to do before. Now things had changed. The Lord told them to bring everything they had and that he who had no sword should sell his garment and buy one. The disciples did not understand this and answered immediately, "Lord, behold, here are two swords." The Lord said, "It is enough." The Lord was saying, "You have spoken enough. The age has changed. From now on I will be rejected. Previously, men welcomed Me, but now I am rejected." The disciples did not see this at all. (A little while later, in the garden of Gethsemane, Peter still cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest with his sword.) If I tell the brothers that the Lord's word is a lamp unto my feet, and they come back and ask if it is electric lamp or oil lamp, I will say, "It is enough." Today we have to be clear of our way. We do not want to go to war with anyone. In the ancient days the Jews traveled with swords and staffs. The Lord told the disciples to sell their garment to buy a sword, but this sword was not for warfare. He said this to the disciples because men would no longer receive the Lord and would no longer render any supply to the disciples. The Lord has never commissioned us to go to war because His kingdom is not of this world.</p><p>Should a Christian be against war? We have no compulsion to fight. We are standing on Christian ground, and we are not for war. But this does not mean that we will oppose war. War is something that a government engages in. A government can declare war, but Christians should abide by Christ's commandment. The Lord has not commanded us to be fighters. At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in Europe, one person wrote, "If a Christian goes to war, he is a fallen Christian." But no individual has a choice when a nation goes to war. If a man is forced to fight, we have nothing to say about this. It is between him and the Lord. But we have to be clear that God's Spirit is for peace in this age. The Lord said, "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matt. 5:9). If a brother finds himself in a war, he should say to those in authority, "I believe that the human soul is eternal. I cannot kill." What the authority will want to do with us is up to it. We cannot be fighters. If a brother stands in a battlefield and his enemy is a brother, surely he cannot kill him. If he is a sinner, he cannot kill him either. If he kills him, he is sending his soul to the eternal lake of fire. Hence, a Christian cannot go to war.</p><p>The above discussions pertain to a Christian's attitude and practice with regard to civil government and his country. We have to make these things clear to the new ones so that they will have the right attitude and will choose the right way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">WAITING FOR THE LORD'S RETURN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:7; 1 Thes. 1:9-10; Phil. 3:20; Titus 2:11-13</h1><h2 class="head1">THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHING<br />CONCERNING THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</h2><p>According to the Scriptural teaching, the Lord came once in the flesh; He died for us on the cross to satisfy God's righteousness and then resurrected and ascended to be our High Priest. He is now interceding for us before God and acting on our behalf as our Executor and Guarantor. He also will come to the earth a second time. The Old Testament says that when the Lord comes back again there will be no more sin on earth (Isa. 2:11). Many portions of the Bible tell us specifically about the Lord's return. The Lord Himself said, "I go to prepare a place for you....I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" (John 14:2b, 3). Acts 1:11 says that when the Lord was taken up to heaven, two angels declared, "This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven." This tells us that our Lord will come a second time. In Hebrews 9:28 the writer declared to God's children, "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation." By the time of Revelation 22:20, the Lord had come once and had ascended. The Holy Spirit had come. Most of the apostles were gone, and the holy city was destroyed; only John was left. At this juncture the Lord comforted His saints, saying, "Yes, I come quickly." John responded, saying, "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus." From these verses we can see that the Lord has not only come once. He will come a second time.</p><p>Every Lord's Day evening, we gather together to break bread and remember the Lord. The Lord commanded us to do this, and we will continue to do this until He comes. We will never stop this kind of glorious waiting. Every time we break bread and remember the Lord, we are waiting for His return. We believe that He has come not only once but that He will come a second time. This fact is as sure as the fact of the cross. The cross dealt with our sins, but the history of sin is not finished. To the believers, the matter of sin and the history of sin will not be terminated until the Lord comes back again. The cross judged sin, while the second coming will terminate sin. There are many testimonies concerning the Lord's coming in various passages in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />TOWARDS THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</h2><p>Having realized that the Lord will come again, we need to have a proper attitude toward His coming. Hearing a message on His coming and knowing the doctrine of His coming are not the end; we have to be those who wait for His coming. We have to read the passages concerning the Lord's coming to new ones right after they believe. This will make them persons who "await His Son from the heavens." Suppose your supervisor sends a letter saying that he will come back on July 1. Would you merely mark "read" on the letter and file it away? Of course not. You would prepare for his return. The proper attitude towards the Lord's coming is to wait. We do not search with curiosity the prophecies concerning His second coming. A Christian who lives on earth today should adopt a waiting attitude for the Lord's return. It is wrong to give up this waiting attitude. Waiting for the Lord's return means that a man still goes about his business, but his eyes are set on the Lord's coming. He knows that when the Lord comes back, He will demand certain things and ask him certain questions. He waits for the Lord like a slave waiting for his master to return. While he waits, he cannot beat his fellow slaves. Rather, he has to serve faithfully and wait patiently.</p><p>The Lord said that He could come any time, but before He comes there will be signs. These signs will all be fulfilled. There are five kinds of signs concerning His coming. The first concerns the Jews, the second concerns the Roman Catholic Church, the third concerns the church, the fourth concerns the world, and the fifth concerns other matters in general. The signs concerning the Jews are mostly fulfilled. During the first half of the twentieth century, Palestine freed itself from the British colonial rule, and the Jews formed their own nation in 1948. They had been without a nation for 2,600 years, but the time of their restoration has come. In Matthew 24:32 the Lord told the disciples to learn from the fig tree. When the nation of Israel is restored, we know that the day of the Lord is near. God's children should be aware of the events leading to the Lord's soon return and wait for His return daily.</p><p>We have to show new ones that it is one thing to believe in the Lord's return and to research the subject, but it is altogether a different matter to wait for His return. Not many people see the difference. First Thessalonians 1:9-10 says that the believers reported how they turned from the idols to serve a living and true God and awaited His Son from the heavens. This shows that as soon as a person believes in the Lord, his attitude toward the Lord and His return changes. Waiting for His return is not the same as studying prophecy or researching the millennium and the new heaven and new earth. The latter belong to a different category. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he should have a different attitude toward the Lord's return. This is right and proper. Unless he makes this turn, all his actions and possessions will still be earthly. A believer has been brought into the heavenly new creation. All his actions and possessions should work towards his heavenly deposit. A person who waits for the Lord's return does not busy himself with writing books and establishing a name for himself. While he is on earth, he waits for the Lord to return from heaven. He is a heavenly citizen, one who follows the teaching of the anointing. This waiting should be a lifetime yardstick of a believer; it should bring about a change in his living and lifestyle. He has touched the city which has the foundations, and he has no further hope for anything earthly. Everything about him should revolve around his hope for the Lord's return.</p><p>In my whole life I have never been impressed by another person like I was by Miss M. E. Barber. She was indeed a person who waited for the Lord's return. There are many famous men in Christianity who studied prophecy, such as D. M. Panton. They all knew about the Lord's return. But to my knowledge, only Miss Barber was a person who truly waited for His return. It was a big surprise to her that the Lord had not returned in her time. One year I spent the last day, New Year's eve, with her. She prayed, "Lord, if You want to come now, there is still time this year; You do not have to wait until next year." Her face was towards the Lord's coming. Christians do not wait for a time when we will serve the church; we wait for a time when the Lord will come again. If a believer is not careful, but substitutes other things for the Lord's return, he becomes fallen immediately. Once Miss Barber wrote a hymn concerning the Lord's coming. I did not understand one line she wrote in her hymn. She answered, "Come with me and I will show you." We went out and took a walk. When we were about to turn a corner, she said to me, "The Lord is coming; He is getting closer and closer. Perhaps we will see Him around the corner." In her I saw a person who was waiting for the Lord's return, and I realized what it means to wait for the Lord to return. Her whole life was a life of preparing for the Lord's return. Day by day, while she lived on the earth, she waited eagerly for the Lord to return.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO COMINGS OF THE LORD</h2><p>In His first coming, the Lord became flesh and was crucified on the cross for man's sin, giving man the power to overcome sin and to draw near to God. Man receives the power of life, but this power is only half of the story, because he is only delivered from sin. The life that he has received is a life that delivers, but it does not deal with sin itself; sin itself has not been annihilated. Hence, we can say that the first coming of the Lord liberates us, that is, we are liberated from sin. But sin still exists on this earth. In one sense the salvation of the Lord is not yet complete. Suppose a man falls into the hands of robbers. Christ's first coming is likened to deliverance from the hands of such robbers; He delivered us from the power of sin. But the robbers are still there. In His second coming He will do away with the "robbers." Sin will be removed. The cross is a deliverance in our inward being. His second coming is a deliverance in our outward environment. The first coming of the Lord brought us salvation in life. The second coming of the Lord will bring us a complete salvation because He will wipe out sin altogether.</p><p>A Bible seller in Shanghai said, "Once a man is saved, he will not need to sin." But another person retorted, saying, "As long as a man remains on this earth, he will sin. This is like living in a coal mine; everyone in it is black with soot." The first brother answered, "But never forget that the sea water may be salty, but all the fishes in the sea are not; they are fresh." The first coming of the Lord made the "fish" no longer "salty." His second coming will make the "sea" no longer "salty." In His first coming, the Lord saved us individually one by one. In His second coming, He will save the world as well. In His first coming, He dealt with everything related to life. In His second coming, He will deal with the environment. Today all of us who are saved through His first coming have a new life. When He comes again, we will inherit a new environment to match our new life within. Although He gave us a new life in His first coming, our bodies are still mortal; they will still die. But when He comes again, our body will swallow up mortality. His first coming does not remove the weaknesses in our bodies; our bodies still pose limitations to God's work in us. In His second coming, our bodies will be fully redeemed. All weaknesses will be gone, and God's work will be fully accomplished in us.</p><p>Today a Christian overcomes many things inwardly, but he is not yet delivered from many environments around him. The outward environment is like Sodom. Although Lot was a righteous man, it was a suffering for him to live in Sodom. Today sin is our neighbor. The more we are delivered from sin, the more we feel the evil of sin around us. When the Lord comes again, we will be saved even in our environment. Our body will be saved, and death will not have any power over our body. Then there will be no more weakness and no more thorns. We are looking for the Lord's soon return. Those who are under some kind of oppression are even more eager for His return. The more we hate sin, the more we cry out for the Lord's return. How terrible is the environment around us! Not only are sin and death unresolved, even Satan is unresolved. God's word shows us that the whole world lies in the wicked one (1 John 5:19). His power is still operating in this world. In His first coming, the Lord gave us the power to overcome Satan. In His second coming, He will deal with the power of Satan Himself. He will even deal with the sin in our environment and the death in our body. We are full of joy and thanksgiving. Before that day comes, we have to wait for the Lord to finish that second half of His work.</p><p>Because of their ignorance of the Lord's work in His second coming, some people have formed wrong concepts about Christianity. They think that Christians are only interested in a gospel for individuals, that they are not interested in a gospel for society as a whole. Actually we believe in an individual gospel, and we also believe in a social gospel. The time for the social gospel will be when the Lord comes again. Today the Lord has not charged us to take care of the society around us. The world tries to change society with science. But we are changing society with life. We can do what the world cannot do. We are here to save the souls of those in society. When the Lord comes the second time, the world will not only be saved inwardly but will be saved outwardly as well. In His first coming the Lord saved individuals. In His second coming He will save the entire society. Today Christians are engaged in a spiritual work, while others are engaged in social work. We do not reform society; we only bring men to God and save them one by one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S SECOND COMING<br />RESOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class="head2">Injustice</h2><p>This world has many fundamental problems that man cannot solve. They can only be resolved when the Lord comes again. The first thing that will be resolved when He comes again will be justice. In this world, there are oppressors and there are the oppressed. There are exploiters and there are the exploited. Not only is there injustice in material things but also in nonmaterial things. Throughout history we find people who were so oppressed that they could suffer no longer. As a result, they rose up, rebelled, and revolted. Sadly, however, they became oppressors once they became the kings and the rulers. Isaiah 11:4 says that in the future, the world will be filled with justice and righteousness. This is what the Lord will do when He comes again.</p><h2 class="head2">War</h2><p>Second, when the Lord comes again, all the wars in this world will be over. One problem with this world is war. Human history is full of wars. Since the dawn of human history, there have only been 268 years when there was no war on this earth. There are international wars and national wars. The two greatest wars were the First World War and the Second World War. Now there is still a chance of a third World War. The world is full of big wars and small wars. War comes from passions; it is the result of man's constantly unfulfilled passions. Isaiah 2:4 says that when the Lord comes back again, all the swords will be beaten into plowshares and all the spears will be turned into pruning hooks. No nation will wage war against another nation, and no one will learn war any more. What is this? This is salvation of the entire society.</p><h2 class="head2">Sickness</h2><p>Third, when the Lord comes back, all the sicknesses in this world will be gone. There will be no more sickness. Today the world is full of sickness. Science has invented all kinds of medicines, but with the increase of medicine, there has also been an increase of sickness. Many viruses and bacteria improve their immune system with the introduction of more antibiotics; there is no way to eradicate them. A man can be healed by one kind of medicine. But he can become sick again and need further treatment. No matter how hard man tries, he cannot get rid of sickness. According to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, sickness has much to do with sin; it is the result of judgment on sin. When the Lord comes again and eventually in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the tree of life whose leaves will heal the nations (Rev. 22:2; Ezek. 47:12). In the coming world, there will be no sickness.</p><h2 class="head2">Famine</h2><p>Fourth, when the Lord comes again, He will remove famine from humanity. The Old Testament tells us that the earth does not yield to man because of man's sin. Vegetables do not grow naturally by themselves; they have to be cultivated. However, useless thorns and thistles flourish. It is interesting to note that all vegetation that is beneficial to man does not grow naturally. The only vegetation that flourishes naturally is the kind that is not beneficial to man. Today famine is found everywhere. Even when man applies all kinds of fertilizers, he is not guaranteed good harvests. It seems that man must struggle with the environment before he can find food. Such problems will be solved when the Lord comes back. Isaiah 35:1 and 6 say that the desert will flow with rivers and the earth will no longer bring forth wild weeds. Now, whatever man does not cultivate will not proliferate. Then, man will no longer have to wrestle with nature.</p><h2 class="head2">Education</h2><p>Fifth, when the Lord comes again, the question of education will be resolved. Today some are educated while others are not. Today's education does not help man to know God but to know good and evil and to turn from evil to good. But education cannot solve the problem of sin within man's heart. Today some people know God while others do not. But when the Lord comes back again, no one will need to teach his fellow citizen or brother to know God; from the little one to the great one, all will know Him (Heb. 8:11). When the Lord comes back again, all will know God.</p><h2 class="head2">Sinful Establishments</h2><p>Sixth, when the Lord comes back, He will deal with all the establishments that induce man to sin. On the one hand, man sins because he has a sinful nature within him. On the other hand, he sins because there are many sinful places in this world. Such places as brothels, opium dens, cinemas, and dance halls encourage man to sin. In the cities one finds more rich people and correspondingly more sinful establishments. Matthew 13:41 says that when the Son of Man comes, He will send His angels to pick out from His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and all the wicked ones and cast them into the furnace. Today there are all kinds of means and places that induce man to sin. When the Lord comes again, they will all be cast into the fire. We believe that when the Lord comes back, He will do this.</p><h2 class="head2">The Suffering of All Creation</h2><p>Seventh, when the Lord comes back, the entire creation will be redeemed. Some living creatures are suffering today on account of man's fall. Many kinds of animals, whether higher or lower, are suffering and oppressed in this world. It is impossible for tigers and man to coexist in peace. It is likewise impossible for lions and human beings to cohabit together. In the old days animals were even more abused than they are now. The same can be said of house pets and domesticated animals. They are all sighing and suffering, waiting for the day of redemption to come (Rom. 8:21-22). When the Lord comes back again, the sighing of the whole creation will cease. Isaiah 11:6 and 9 say that the wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling will be together, and a young boy shall lead them. They will not hurt nor destroy anyone or anything. That will indeed be a grand release and great deliverance of the whole universe.</p><h2 class="head2">Earthly Governments</h2><p>Eighth, when the Lord comes again, all earthly governments will cease. Today is the day when man reigns. But no one can be just and righteous. This is the reason many people are oppressed. Revelation 11:15 says that one day all the nations of the earth will become the kingdom of our Lord and His Christ. Then no government will oppress its people. Then the earth will be filled with righteousness and justice. Without the second coming of the Lord, salvation will not be complete. Day by day as we observe the injustice, unrighteousness, and oppression of the weak by the strong, the small by the great, and all other such things in the world around us, we believe even more firmly that the Lord will come back again. Once He comes, all these negative things will be done away.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE AND RESPONSIBILITY<br />TOWARD THE WORLD</h2><p>The Lord's coming is our hope of glory. In the course of our waiting for His return, we should have a proper kind of living and a proper waiting attitude. There are many unbelievers in this world, and we have to know that we can never join them in their kind of gospel. Man's basic need is life, not material or psychological satisfaction. Salvation is the fundamental guiding principle of a believer. We cannot allow unsaved persons in this world to do gospel work. Their so-called social gospel is not a gospel at all. They have rejected the Lord's redemption altogether. Our preaching of the gospel results in men being saved, not in the problems of society being solved. We are commissioned by the Lord to save every lost soul. Today as proper human beings, we can do our best to help others. But we have to know that we are limited. Our main work on earth is to bring men to God.</p><p>Before the Lord became flesh, that is, before His first coming, everyone was a sinner living in a sinful world. After the Lord's first coming, all the believers became righteous men living in a sinful world. When He comes again, we will be righteous men living in a righteous world. We have to show the new ones that while we are living on this earth, we have to fulfill our duty as a Christian; we have to help to save more men. This is our only hope. Other problems will be solved when the Lord comes back again. All the signs and signals of this world point to the soon approach of the day of the Lord, and for this we have to watch and wait.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">MARTYRDOM</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading:Rev. 2&mdash;3</h1><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA</h2><p>Revelation is a book given by the Lord Jesus "to His slaves" (1:1). This is a book for slaves. It shows the slaves the things that must quickly take place. In this book on future events, two of the letters to the seven local churches speak of martyrdom. One is to the church in Smyrna and the other to the church in Pergamos. In the letter to Smyrna, there is not a word of rebuke. The word Smyrna means "myrrh" in the original language; it signifies suffering. Myrrh is a compound used to embalm the dead (John 19:39). It is very much related to death. The church in Smyrna, like its name suggests, is a suffering church. It is a church that suffers for the sake of Christ. The Lord commands this church, "Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life" (Rev. 2:10). Martyrdom, trial, persecution, and tribulation for ten days&mdash;these are the Lord's allotted portions for the church in Smyrna. In spite of the fact that the Lord allowed Satan to inflict all kinds of tribulation on His church, He put a limit to Satan's activities. "You will have tribulation for ten days." "Ten days" in the Bible signifies a very short time (Gen. 24:55; Dan. 1:12). It denotes a short period. This signifies that the sufferings which the post-apostolic church experienced were very brief.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS</h2><p>The church in Pergamos describes the condition that came immediately after the church in Smyrna. Although the suffering of Smyrna reversed the backsliding of Ephesus, the trend did not last for long. By the time of Pergamos, confusion came in again. The Lord says to the church in Pergamos, "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells" (Rev. 2:13). The throne is a symbol of authority. The place where Satan exercises his authority is the present world. The world is the place where Satan reigns (1 John 5:19; John 14:30). The Lord says that Pergamos dwells where Satan's throne is. This indicates that the church in Pergamos is in the world. What a pity that the church is dwelling in the place where Satan reigns! Under these circumstances the Lord boasts in His martyrs. He mentions the name of Antipas, His faithful witness. He says, "Antipas, My witness, My faithful one." The Lord expects His children to be like Antipas, faithful unto death. He wants them to hold fast the Lord's word even at the point of death. He wants them to be witnesses to His life.</p><p>In the previous letter to Smyrna, we find Satan casting some into prison. In this letter to Pergamos, we find persecutions, tribulations, and martyrdom in the dwelling place of Satan. According to the letter to Pergamos, Satan's persecution of the church always is concentrated in one area. Satan not only moves back and forth on the surface of the earth, as described in Job, but he is looking for those whom he can devour. He has his dwelling place, his own address. His address is where he carries out his persecution of the believers. Satan places his throne at places which are convenient for him to persecute the believers. He is setting up his throne in places where he conducts persecutions, that is, in places where he murders God's children. Satan can set up his throne in Rome, Lyon, or London, and direct his persecution from there.</p><h2 class="head1">MARTYRDOM BEING THE REQUIREMENT<br />FOR EVERY BELIEVER</h2><p>The Lord tells the church in Smyrna, "Be faithful unto death" (Rev. 2:10). This shows us that the Lord wants martyrs. Whenever a believer faces persecution or threats to his life, he has to take heed to the Lord's word, be faithful unto death, and be ready to sacrifice his very life. The Lord's requirement is nothing less than our very life.</p><p>In the church in Pergamos, where Antipas was about to be killed, there was one who was "faithful unto death." The Lord praises Antipas as "My witness, My faithful one" (2:13). It is interesting that for two thousand years, no one has known of this Antipas. His name is not mentioned in any other place in the Bible nor in history. But the Lord knows him and mentions him by name. A man who completely passed the notice of the worldly church was noticed by God. Man can ignore such a one, but the Lord never forgets. He speaks of him by name and points out his faithfulness. How precious is the death of the saints in the eyes of God! How the Lord cares for the martyrs who are martyred for His name's sake. The prefix anti means "against," and the root pas means "all men." In other words, when everyone was against the Lord, Antipas set himself against everyone. A martyr is one whom the Lord reckons to be faithful. We have to tell new believers that the Lord has shown us this fact: All believers should be ready to sacrifice their life for the Lord. Every believer should not only believe in Him but also expect to sacrifice his life for Him. Matthew 10:18 says, "And you will also be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles." Verse 21 says, "And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death." For two thousand years church history has been intimately linked to the world's hatred. Everyone who acknowledges the Lord's name is hated by men. He will be delivered to death. Being delivered to death does not necessarily mean dying. It means being prepared to die. Martyrdom is a requirement for everyone.</p><p>The Lord said, "Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do...fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One" (Luke 12:4-5). Satan can only kill the body; he cannot kill our soul and spirit. Therefore, we do not have to fear him. A sister was taken before a magistrate because of her faith. When the magistrate saw the smile on her face, he hit her. The sister said, "You can destroy my body, but you cannot destroy my soul and spirit. The peace within me gives me this smile." We have to tell new ones that many people have sealed their preaching with their blood. Men like Stephen, James, Mark, Matthew, Peter, Matthias, Andrew, Paul, Judas (the Lord's brother), Bartholomew, Luke, Barnabas, Timothy, and Ananias were all martyrs. We have to show new ones that a disciple of the Lord has to be faithful unto death.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR THE BELIEVERS' MARTYRDOM</h2><p>If a new one asks why there must be martyrdom, we should tell him that the world hates the Lord for no reason (John 15:25). Matthew 10:22 tells us that believers will be hated by men because of the Lord's name. Satan is the one who instigates this. He is the one who is behind men. One writer who wrote of the martyrs in the first two centuries said that every year, except for the first day of January, over five thousand believers were killed every day. At that time those who preached the gospel, preached with their own blood. There was a saying that the martyr's blood is the seed of the gospel. Some Roman soldiers observed believers at the time of their martyrdom and were so greatly moved that they believed in the Lord and requested that they be allowed to join the martyrs. Satan hates the name of Christ; his followers are all workers of evil. They do not want the light. This is the reason they try to kill believers of Christ. On the one hand, a believer suffers death because he is faithful and would not betray the Lord. On the other hand, this is how he confesses the Lord's name according to the teaching of the Scripture. Matthew 10:32 says, "Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens."</p><p>Christian martyrdom is different from any other kind of martyrdom. Others are caught because they cannot run fast enough. A Christian can escape, but he would rather not run because of the Lord's name. Some were brought before the idols and were asked only to burn incense before the images in order to be released. However, they refused and were thrown to the beasts and eaten up. During the great Catholic inquisition, those who acknowledged the Catholic mass were released, and those who refused were murdered. Under all kinds of duress, believers chose to confess the Lord's name. All of God's children know that there is no need to fear him who is able only to kill the body but not the soul and spirit. Such ones can only destroy one's mortal body. The noble expression on the face of many martyrs is indeed a beautiful testimony. In Acts 20:24 Paul said, "I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God." The way of the church is to finish the ministry it has received and to testify of the gospel of the grace of God. At the conference in Acts 15, James, Peter, and the elders also said in their letter of recommendation of Paul and Barnabas that they were men who had "risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (v. 26).</p><p>Christian martyrdom comes from the persecutions of the world on the one hand and from the Roman Catholic Church on the other hand. John 16:2 says, "For every one who kills you...think[s] that he is offering service to God." The Roman Catholic Church believes in God, but it considered killing Christians as a service to God. Persecutions from these two sources make Christian martyrdom one of the most beautiful chapters in church history.</p><p>Persecutions have followed the same pattern throughout the past two thousand years. Countless numbers of people died from the Catholic persecution during and before the time of Martin Luther. During the Spanish reign, the Roman Catholic Church murdered many people. Still more died during the reign of Mussolini. From 1929 to 1940 over 1.3 million Christians died in the Soviet Union. Second Thessalonians 2:3 says that Antichrist, the son of perdition, will oppose the Lord. On the one hand, there is the persecution from the world. On the other hand, there is the persecution from the Roman Catholic Church. These persecutions will follow God's children wherever they go.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MARTYRS</h2><h2 class="head2">Ignatius</h2><p>Ignatius accepted the gospel after hearing it from John in Antioch. He was put into prison for preaching it to the Roman emperor. He was severely beaten. The Roman soldiers forced him to put his hands to the fire. They forced him to dip his fingers in burning oil and to put it between his legs. They also scorched his skin with a red hot iron. In the end he was thrown to the beasts and eaten. Before he went to Rome, he knew that he was going to die, and he wrote a letter to Polycarp, saying, "Before I reach Rome, I must fight with the beasts and be bound and led to the cruel ones. The better I treat them, the more cruel they will treat me. Day by day I am beaten severely by them. How I yearn to see the mouth of the beasts and to find death coming upon me soon. Here I am learning to look beyond the seen to the unseen. I only desire to gain Christ. I am willing to see my body torn to pieces and the pain of the lion's claw and the beastly scourge come upon me, if I can only know Christ and gain Him."</p><h2 class="head2">Polycarp</h2><p>Polycarp was the bishop of Smyrna. When he was eighty-six years old, persecutors sought after him, but he escaped. One night in a dream, he saw his bed on fire, and he knew that he was going to be martyred for the Lord. When his captors came for him, they were amazed at the calmness and peace on his face. He asked that he be given an hour to pray. Although his captors somewhat repented of their actions, they still handed him to the governor and prepared for his burning at the stake outside the city. Realizing that he was advanced in age, they were somewhat hesitant to put him to death. They promised that they would let him go if he would only deny Jesus. But he said, "I cannot deny Him. Eighty-six years the Lord has never changed His grace; He has never done me any wrong. How can I deny Him?" The men lit the fire while he continued to praise God in its midst. The soldiers pierced his side and much blood came out. After his lower body was burnt, he could still speak, and he said, "Thank God that I can have the opportunity to testify today with my life." Twelve believers were burned alive together with him. He was indeed a person who knew the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Perpetua</h2><p>Perpetua was twenty-six years old when she was martyred. She was well educated, and her family was very rich. When she was caught, she had a child with her. Her father loved her very much and went to prison to persuade her to give up her faith. She was strong in faith, however, and was not moved. Her father became angry and said he would no longer come to see her. When she was brought before the magistrate, she was ordered to offer a sacrifice to the idols. She refused and was sent to the cellars. Two stewards taking care of jailed believers tried their best to allow her to devote some of her rest times to nurse her child. She realized that she did not have long to live, and she committed her child to her own mother. Later her father could not stand the thought of her suffering and came to persuade her again, gently and with much pleading. She knew clearly that she had to give up everything for Christ, so she told her father, "May God's will be done." The judge asked her to seriously consider her father's tears, her child's need, and her own life's perils. She overcame all natural affection, ignored all sufferings in the mind and the flesh, and readily sacrificed all human love for Christ. For His sake, she waited quietly for her time of execution. A sister among the convicted called Felicitas was equally ready to give up her life. She gave birth to a daughter while in prison and committed the baby to another sister's care. Later the two sisters were taken to the beasts together. After almost bleeding to death, they were pierced by executioners with swords to end their lives. This happened in March of A.D. 205. Countless people were martyred about the same time.</p><h2 class="head2">Persecutions from the Roman Catholic Church</h2><h2 class="head3">A Graduate from Cambridge University</h2><p>Much persecution came from the Roman Catholic Church. The Church's persecutions were by far the most serious. There was a graduate of Cambridge University who would not subscribe to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. The Church sent men for him and was about to take him to the stake. They tortured him. He meekly accepted the verdicts and gladly took his last meal. The executioners mocked him, saying, "If your God is real, you will not be burnt even if you go through the fire. Put your finger on the candle and try it." The student said, "Your fire can only burn my finger. But this fire will purify me and take me to the Lord much faster than the chariots of fire that took Elijah." When the fire spread over his body, he prayed earnestly, "Lord, do not judge Your servant. There is no one living who is righteous before You." One brother came to him, saying, "When my day comes, I want to be like you." Another priest came and shouted, "I am not the one who burns you." He turned around and comforted the priest. When he was about to give up his last breath, he shouted, "Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus," and committed his soul to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">Brother Daniel in France</h2><p>[Translator's Note: The names of the following persons are translated from Chinese. We cannot ascertain the source from which Mr. Nee quoted the following stories.]</p><p>Brother Daniel was a Frenchman. He did not agree with the Catholic Church. One day the archbishop of the church told the jailer to send Daniel to him the following Monday. The jailer approached him and asked, "Do you know what I am going to do to you?" Daniel said, "My Lord knows what will happen to me. I believe I will die there. Thank God for being so gracious to me." He took dinner with two of his friends in the same calm way. Someone asked him, "Do you still have a heart to eat?" He answered, "For the past few years, I have learned to be a prisoner for God. Do I fear death still? I believe the Lord will give me the strength." After he was handed over to the summoner, he was sentenced to die on Saturday. When someone told him that he would be dismembered and his four limbs would be displayed on the four gates of the city, he asked, "Where are they going to put my head?" They answered, "Upon another gate." At the time of his execution, the executioner would not allow him to say a word. Yet he endured his death joyfully, gently, and patiently.</p><h2 class="head3">Henry the Englishman</h2><p>Henry was an Englishman. He was also murdered by the Roman Catholic Church. Before he died, he prayed while standing on burning charcoal, "Today I suffer not for my sin, but for upholding my faith and for inheriting the promised blessing. The One who has called me is demonstrating His life through such an act. I sacrifice my life for His sake. Flee from the lies of the priests so that you can escape the eternal fire of hell." Those who stood by him wept bitterly. After he prayed, he was put on the stake. While others were lighting the fire, he turned around and said to the crowd, "Do pray!" Soon after he died.</p><h2 class="head3">Rogis (?)</h2><p>Brother Rogis said at the time of his trial in prison, "The apostles suffered for Christ's sake. I also took up my gallows for His sake. Since God has ordained this, He will sustain me with His life and grace, and I will praise Him. I believe that the truth, which is God's word, will eventually prevail. When your law falls to the dust, God's word will prevail." One constable asked him, "Do you want to repent for your faith?" He answered firmly, "I want to affirm my preaching with my blood." The constable did not believe him, but he said, "You will know what I mean when we arrive at the execution ground." The constable said, "I will not pray for you," to which Rogis replied, "But I will pray for you." He was led to the execution ground. While he was being burned, he lifted up his hands to pray. After he expired, his hands were still lifted high.</p><h2 class="head3">Fulowen (?)</h2><p>When this brother was brought before the judge, the judge tried to persuade him to recant his faith. But he said to the judge, "I have told you all that I wanted to say. You can do whatever pleases you." His friends tried to persuade him to change his decision, but he said, "I cannot change what I have said. May all men forgive me, and I forgive all men." While he was being burned, he stretched out his hands. The executioners tried to cut off his hands. Because there was not enough wood to burn him to death, the executioners decided to finish his life instead.</p><h2 class="head3">Wichill (?)</h2><p>Wichill was another person persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church. A few cardinals condemned him and were ready to put him to the stake. They erected a scaffold and were ready to burn him upon it. On his way there, many soldiers surrounded him and bound his hands behind him. One beggar met him along the way and begged for something. He replied, "How I wish I could give you something with my hands. May the Lord meet your needs." Two other Catholic believers met him and said, "Pray to the holy mother." He replied, "Do not tempt me any longer." After he was tied to the stake, he knelt down and prayed, "May the Lord receive my soul." Then he turned to the sinners and said, "Do not stumble because I have suffered for my faith. You should receive salvation, which comes from the word of God. Receiving Him is untold comfort. I have received the grace today to suffer this persecution and tribulation which will not be long. If I preach man's teaching, I will receive man's approval. But I am preaching God's salvation, and for this I receive joy, peace, and comfort from the Lord Himself. I am able to face death fearlessly for Christ's sake. Do not fear those who can destroy the body but not the soul. This night I will be supping with my Lord." Then he prayed, "Father, forgive them. I forgive them from my heart. May You forgive them also." In the end he exhorted the crowd to warn their priests to depart from sin or else judgment would come upon them. One executioner came forth and knelt before him, asking for forgiveness. He replied, "Come," and he kissed him, saying, "This is the mark of one who forgives."</p><h2 class="head1">FUTURE GLORY OF THE MARTYRS</h2><p>There has never been a break in the Christian lineage of martyrdom. For two thousand years all of God's children who have suffered this way believed that they would reign in the coming kingdom. Revelation 20:4 says, "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years." Please note that it says that every throne is occupied by a person. There are four kinds of people who are on the thrones. The first are those who have overcome; judgment will be given to them. The second are those who are beheaded for the testimony of Jesus. The third are those who are killed because of the word of God. This refers to the saints in the Old Testament. The fourth are those who have not worshipped the beast nor his image. These are the martyrs during the great tribulation. These four kinds of people will reign with Christ; they will receive the crown of life and inherit the kingdom. Receiving the crown means to be kings and to reign. If we place ourselves willingly in the Lord's hand, great sufferings will await us on the one hand, but we will inherit a surpassing eternal weight of glory on the other hand. In addition to Revelation 20:4, verses 2:7 and 3:5 also speak of overcomers. Overcomers are those who confess the Lord's name before the Father and the angels. Matthew 10:32 and Luke 12:8 show us that all those who confess the Lord's name before men will be confessed before the Father and His messengers in the kingdom.</p><p>The Bible shows us that at the end of this age, brothers will kill brothers, fathers will deliver their sons to death, and children will be enemies of their parents and will kill them. Christians will face unprecedented and severe persecutions. We have to show new ones that even though the martyrs died, each one testified to the Lord's grace with his mouth. How hard is the way of the martyrs, yet how glorious is their end!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">ON KNOWING ROMAN CATHOLICISM</h1><p>Today we will consider Roman Catholicism. We want to expose its idolatry as well as its persecution of genuine believers. We have to help the new ones to know Roman Catholicism. Such knowledge will help them know how to deal with it and will save them from much frustration. Revelation 17:4 says, "And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication." If we consider today's Catholicism in the light of this verse, we must admit that this woman refers to the Roman Catholic Church. In the Roman Catholic Church there is purple and scarlet in every corner. The cardinals' robes are scarlet. The Catholic Church is full of precious stones, gold, and silver. The pope has two crowns, one representing his religious power and the other his secular power. Both crowns are made of gold. The one that represents his secular power has one hundred forty-six large diamonds, five hundred forty pearls, and seven levels of gold. This is the true picture of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>"Having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations." Abominations refer to the idols. Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Daniel 9:27, 2 Chronicles 33:2, and Ezekiel 20:7-8 all say that idols are abominations. Please note the crucial items in Revelation 17:4. First, the woman is holding a golden cup. Second, the cup is for serving wine to others. Outwardly the cup is golden, seemingly divine. Gold signifies the divine nature. Yet this cup is filled with abominations. These abominations are the idols. They are introduced to all the world for worship by Roman Catholicism. The Catholic Church worships Mary because all other world religions have goddesses. Christianity is the only religion that does not have a goddess. Roman Catholicism brought in the idea of a "goddess" from paganism. It created Mary as a "goddess" and teaches men to worship her. We have to know this fact and have to help new ones understand that idolatry is an abomination in the eyes of God. A Christian cannot defile himself with any kind of idolatry.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HERESY OF MARY WORSHIP</h2><p>Mary began to be exalted in the fifth century. The title "mother of God" was applied to Mary at the time of the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431. There is a book called The Glories of Mary, written by a bishop called Alphonsus Maria De Liguori, in which he describes in detail how the Catholic Church exalts and worships Mary. Part I, Chapter VI, Section III of that book says that "Mary is the Peace-maker between Sinners and God." Chapter II, Section I says "Mary is our Life, because she obtains for us the Pardon of our Sins." Chapter V, Section I speaks of "The Necessity of the Intercession of Mary for Our Salvation." Elsewhere it says that those who fail and fall do so because they have not sought the help of Mary. It tells us that "the Holy Church charges all men to reserve a special place of worship for Mary"; a man can receive many things from Mary which he cannot receive from God, because as Chapter VIII, Section I says, "Mary delivers her Clients from Hell." She has dominion over all the kings of demons.</p><p>In Chapter VIII, Section III Mary is said to "lead her Servants to Heaven." No one can enter the blessed kingdom except through her. The way of salvation is open to man only through Mary. Since our salvation lies in the hand of Mary, those who are under her protection are saved, while those who are not will perish. Salvation is linked to Mary. To Catholics, Mary is intimately related to the Lord. She is eternally grateful to the Son for choosing her to be His mother. But at the same time, He is eternally grateful to her for giving Him His humanity. He has to repay what He owes her by glorying in her and honoring her in a particular way. He does this by answering her prayers and requests.</p><p>The book also said that Christ's authority has been given to Mary. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to you [Mary]." Everything (including God) has to obey Mary. God has subjected the entire church under Mary's dominion. Chapter VI, Section I says that "Mary is an Advocate who is able to save all." Whatever she decides to do, she is able to do it. It claims that Mary is almighty. It argues that the authority of the mother is as great as the authority of the Son. If the Son is almighty, so must be the mother. Some have even claimed that the whole church is not only under her grace but under her authority also.</p><p>Chapter VI, Section III says that Mary is a Messenger of peace, that she is a "Peace-maker between Sinners and God....Many times we receive answer to our prayer quicker by invoking Mary's name than by invoking Jesus' name....She is our salvation, our life, our hope, our counselor, our hiding place, and our trust." The book mentions a story: A little bird was once taught to say the words "sea gulls" and was told that these words mean "all hail Mary." One day a large fowl preyed on the little bird. The little bird cried "sea gulls," and the large fowl dropped dead immediately. The book then explains by saying that even a senseless bird can receive answer and deliverance through calling on Mary's name. If a man calls on her name, he surely will be saved. The book also says that even the heretics at times cannot help but cry to Mary for hope. It says that everyone who holds any office in the holy Catholic Church should raise his voice every day to call on the name of Mary because she is the hope of all men.</p><p>In Chapter III Section I, it says that the Bible teaches us that in His love, the Father gave us the Son to die for us. One saint said that we can say the same thing about Mary. Liguori said that Mary is the savior of sinners, that beside her there is no salvation. He described an imaginary scenario: a man heavily laden with sin saw two ladders hanging from heaven. One was red, with the Lord standing on top of it. The other was white, with the most holy mother standing on top of it. The man climbed up the red ladder. When he saw the angry face at the top of the ladder, he fell down. In his despair he heard a voice that said, "Try the other ladder." He did as he was told and was surprised to find that it was very easy to climb up. On top of that ladder the blessed Mary was waiting for him, ushering him into heaven, and presenting him to Christ. What a great joke!</p><p>One Roman Catholic said, "Who are the saved ones? Who are those who are reigning in heaven? They are those for whom the merciful Queen has made supplications." He went on to explain that Proverbs 8:15 speaks of Mary when it says, "By me kings reign/And rulers decree justice." Through her intercession the soul can reign and take control of one's own lust and can thus be qualified to reign in heaven. In summary, heaven is run by Mary and its gates are opened according to her will. This is the "glories of Mary." The book even claims that it is through God's will that the heaven, the earth, and the lights were created, but it is through Mary's will that God became a man to be like us. Roman Catholics believe that the virgin Mary has become the mother of God and has been uplifted to the same status as God in His Godhead. They have almost replaced all the works of the Lord by Mary. They teach that no one can be saved apart from Mary. One of them was even so foolish as to say that God ordains that no grace be dispensed unless it be dispensed through the hand of Mary.</p><p>From such a heresy, one can see how fallen Roman Catholicism has become. We have to show new ones what Mary said in Luke 1:46-47 in regards to herself, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior." Mary's soul magnified the Lord. She needed the Savior just as we do. We can only come to God through the Lord Jesus. In effect, the Catholic Church has made the Lord the Father and Mary the Son. In reality a man passes through the Son to go to the Father. The entire gospel has been scrambled by the Roman Catholic Church. The Lord says that He is the way and the truth. He is the door of the sheep. Today the Lord is sitting on the throne of grace. But the Catholic Church has put Mary on the throne, and, as such, the Lord has to step down from His own throne. This is heresy. Romish heresy centers around Mary. It demands that men worship Mary, and it proclaims that this worship is our rightful duty!</p><h2 class="head1">THE HERESY OF OTHER FORMS OF IDOLATRY</h2><p>Once a friend of D. M. Panton went to Rome and saw many people worshipping before Mary. Some say that the Lord is in charge of our salvation, while Mary is in charge of our intercession. This means they have usurped the Lord's place and given it to Mary. The truth is that the Lord is our only Savior before God and the only One who can intercede for us. In Rome idol worship can be found in countless numbers of places. Men worship the statue of Mary and the statue of the Father. On the Father's statue is the inscription: "This is God, the Almighty and the Eternal." There are statues for the Son, statues for the twelve apostles, for the saints, and for many believers. Worshippers can worship these images. They teach that there are two qualifications for a saint to be worshipped. First, he must have performed miracles, and second, he must have lived a holy and godly life. These saints are said to have accumulated enough merit to have a surplus of merit. They can exercise their power to bestow on us their surplus. This is the reason we should worship them. It is amazing that heresies such as these and many others can be accepted and believed by so many!</p><p>During the thirteenth century, a very famous man in the Catholic Church by the name of Thomas Aquinas said in his books that the saints have accumulated excess merits. They are compassionate, and they can channel these merits wherever they want under the church's direction. Of course, such boundless merits can also be shared partly by the believers to meet their needs. Such merits can take care of our sins; they also have the power to save us from such sins. Those who say such things are indeed ignorant of the Lord. They do not realize that no sin is so great that the Lord cannot forgive, and no sin needs the aid of the so-called saints. Is there any grace which we are not qualified to receive, and which we need to seek help from Mary? Do not forget that the cup of Catholicism is full of abominations.</p><h2 class="head1">DRUNK WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>Revelation 17:6 says, "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." It is a gruesome thing to drink human blood until one is drunk, but this is the very characteristic of the Roman Catholic Church. There is extreme cruelty in the Catholic Church; it is willing to resort to any means to annihilate genuine believers. The Lord charges us only to bless, not to curse. But the Roman Catholic Church is full of curses. It pronounces anathemas on all kinds of beliefs. It considers all believers of heresies to be accursed. When it calls someone a heretic, it means he is a believer of the Bible. At the Council of Trent one archbishop stood up and said, "We anathematize everything that is different from us." All the other bishops echoed by saying, "Let it be accursed!" They did this at the end of every meeting. What a pitiful situation!</p><p>Luke 9 says that as the days were being fulfilled for Jesus to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face toward Jerusalem. When they reached a village in Samaria, the people there did not receive them. James and John, His two disciples saw this, and they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" The Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (vv. 51-55). This means they did not know what they were saying. When the disciples saw evidences of persecution, their spirits reacted strongly. They wanted to curse, but the Lord stopped them. With the Roman Catholic Church, however, every Thursday evening the pope reads twenty-seven anathemas. Everything that is different from Catholicism is anathematized. These twenty-seven anathemas are further divided into finer points. Hence, in reality there are more than twenty-seven clauses. After the pronouncement, the anathemas are set on fire, and the fire is cast into the earth with the words: "To die eternally, as this fire." Fulota (?) said that the end of those who believe in heresy is death, while Kerdiluma (?) said, "We will never have mercy on those who hold different beliefs than we do. We have to try them and consider them as Sin incarnated."</p><p>Before the Reformation, there was the Inquisition. Countless numbers of people from many countries died under its hand. Those taken before the Inquisition were subjected to all kinds of torture. The Catholics thought that pain was the only way to recover these ones. They erected many gallows and wrenched the tormented ones with ropes until all the bones in their bodies were broken. Sometimes they nailed men's feet to the floor, hung their upper bodies from the beams, and then wrung them with ropes until all their bones were dislocated. At other times they poured boiling oil into men's mouths. We can never imagine the cruelty our brothers in ancient days suffered.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PERSECUTION IN MADRID</h2><p>In Madrid during the first twelve months of the persecution, 10,220 people died. At that time the church did not kill anyone; it merely ordered the local government to execute the killing. Thomas Aquinas believed that the church had the authority to hang the heretics and put them to death in order to preserve the purity of the church. He said, "On the one hand we must not tolerate the heretics, and they should receive just recompense for their sins. But we should also be merciful to them and exhort them twice. Perhaps they can be brought back to the faith of the church. If after the second admonition they still persist in their errors, they must not only be excommunicated but must be destroyed by handing them over to the secular officers." The church would not execute the murder; it handed the job to local officials. The Roman Catholic Church openly claims that the words of Aquinas are the direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit. After the time of Martin Luther, all the bishops had to swear to do their best to persecute those who held different beliefs. All the bishops had to make such a vow before the pope. The Roman Catholic Church canon law says that five popes have ordered the secular rulers of all countries to destroy those who hold different beliefs.</p><p>In 1872 the London Times reported that the Roman Catholic Church believed that anyone who killed under the instruction of a priest was not considered a murderer. On July 13, 1895, the same newspaper reported a speech by the pope in which he said that it was a good deed to kill a Protestant. Such an act could absolve the murderer of the sin of killing a Catholic. The Catholic Church set up cellars in Madrid, in which they packed men with dissenting beliefs. Some had just died, while others could only be identified by their skeletons. There were young men and women, as well as old people. Some were chained in complete nakedness. Within the cells were all kinds of torture instruments. One of the great and spacious halls there was filled with human bones.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PERSECUTIONS IN ROME</h2><p>In 1848 someone discovered a great building in the city of Rome which was full of human bones. There were also two incinerators, beside which were the remains of unburned human bones. One picture of a torture instrument will suffice to show the extent to which the Catholic Church went to deal with Protestants. The church would hang a culprit by his two feet upside-down and lay him on an inclined bench. Very fine ropes would then be tied tightly to the legs and the body. The ropes would then be gradually tightened until they would sink into the flesh and disappear into it. At the same time water would trickle from the ceiling to the man's mouth, which was gagged with a piece of cloth. This would choke the man and would make it difficult for him to breathe. From 1540 when the Jesuits were formed until 1940, the Inquisition murdered 1.9 million people. This is the number of people accounted for. There are still countless numbers of unaccounted-for victims.</p><p>In 1901 Pope Leo XIII gave a speech in Rome in which he proclaimed that the church received power from God to confiscate all the properties of the heretics. In Spain, even today, believers are being persecuted. The number of dead cannot be numbered. The number of living believers amount to only about two thousand five hundred. The condition will worsen towards the end of this age. One brother said that great persecutions will arise, and they will come mainly from Rome. The Bible prophesies that the Roman Catholic Church will be revived one day.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE<br />TOWARDS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2><p>Revelation 18:4 says, "And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people." The Lord wants us to do our best to avoid it, lest we partake of its sin and suffer its sufferings. We must not only pay attention to this word but must tell new ones about it. Every child of God, whether he is a student or a worker, must depart from it. The Catholic Church is violent enough in itself in persecuting the Protestants. But there is something worse&mdash;the Jesuits. Since 1540 the Jesuits have been writing and propagating Catholicism on the one hand and murdering people on the other hand. They murdered many people, yet at the same time they set up schools all over the world. They try to remove true believers in three ways. The first is direct persecution, the second is propagation of theology, and the third is promoting education. One pope said that no priest would be condemned for lying, cheating, or killing, if these were done in the name of protecting the church. We have to warn all of God's children not to attend the Catholic schools. Our brothers and sisters should not try to associate themselves with them. They should not read their books. If anyone comes to you to introduce their teachings and acts, you should tell him that you know them all already. You must never be cheated by them. May the Lord be merciful to us and spare us of such troubles.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE JUDAIZERS</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h2 class="head1">WHO ARE THE JUDAIZERS</h2><p>In Revelation 2:9 the Lord says, "I know your tribulation and poverty (but you are rich) and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan." One of the sufferings of the church in Smyrna is the slander from those who call themselves Jews. Who are these ones who call themselves Jews? According to Romans 2:28-29 and John 8:39-47, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus sincerely from their heart are the true Jews. Those who call themselves Jews are, of course, not the true Jews. They are those who are Jews in the flesh only. The Judaizers are those who have come into the church but have not genuinely believed in the Lord and His salvation. Instead, they try to introduce Judaism into the church. They have been blaspheming the Lord since the day He was on earth. After the church was produced, they continued to slander the apostles. Their slander was actually a reviling of the word of the gospel (Acts 13:45; 18:6; 19:9; 28:22; Rom. 3:8). We will call these ones the Judaizers. They are not ordinary Jews. They creep into the church with the intention of mixing Judaic thoughts with the truth.</p><p>In Revelation the Lord shows that the first group of people who frustrated the church were the Judaizers in Smyrna. By then it had become a "synagogue of Satan." The Judaizers were organized and utilized by Satan to damage the church. When we come to the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3:9, we find these ones continuing to disrupt the church. From church history we see that Christianity has been very much frustrated by Judaism. Once Christianity lets down its guard, Judaism creeps into the church. The Old Testament priesthood was transformed into the pastoral system of the congregations. The law became the standard of one's conduct. The festivals became ritualistic days which men had to keep. This mixture of Judaism began from the time of the church in Smyrna and was not checked until the time of the church in Philadelphia. The work of the Judaizers during that period appeared mainly in the form of the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Thank the Lord that in the nineteenth century a group of people was raised up. They overcame Judaism. These ones belonged to the church in Philadelphia. But today there are still works of the Judaizers in the church. These people preach some very serious heresies. We have to pay close attention to them. We want to consider the three great errors of the Judaizers under three headings. The first concerns their heretical stand with regards to the law. The second concerns their attitude towards the Lord's redemption. The third concerns their attitude towards life after death and the future judgment. We have to spend some time to study the teaching of the Judaizers so that new ones can identify their errors and deal with them when they encounter them.</p><h2 class="head1">HERETICAL TEACHING WITH REGARDS TO THE LAW</h2><h2 class="head2">General Heretical Teachings of the Judaizers<br />regarding the Law</h2><p>First, let us consider the Judaizers' heresy regarding the law. They base their heresy on the Old Testament law which is of two kinds, ceremonial and moral. The Lord came to annul the ceremonial ordinances. This means that He annulled the ceremonial law, but He kept the moral law. The Judaizers say that we should keep the Ten Commandments. Since the fourth commandment is the keeping of the Sabbath, they say we should keep the Sabbath as well. They say that the Sabbath should be kept on Saturday, not Sunday. Let us see if this teaching is Scriptural. We are not here to argue but to examine if a teaching is heretical. If it is, we have to be careful. In order to study the Judaizers' heresy regarding the law, we have to know the Scripture's teaching regarding the law.</p><h2 class="head2">Arguments against<br />the General Heretical Teachings<br />of the Judaizers regarding the Law</h2><h2 class="head3">The Law Not Being Given to the Gentiles</h2><p>First, we have to realize that God did not give the law to the Gentiles; He only gave it to the nation of Israel. Psalm 147:19-20 says, "He declares His word to Jacob,/His statutes and His ordinances to Israel./He has not dealt so with any other nation;/And as for His ordinances, they have not known them." This shows clearly that God only gave His statutes and ordinances to the Israelites. Concerning the Gentiles, Romans 2:14 in the New Testament says that the "Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves." Here we find the phrase Gentiles, who have no law. This proves that the Gentiles are not under the law of God. This is the clear teaching of the Bible. When a Gentile is saved, does he have to keep the law? Acts 15:29 says, "To abstain from things that have been sacrificed to idols and blood and things strangled and fornication, from which if you carefully keep yourselves, you will do well." After Paul preached the gospel, many Gentiles were saved. Some Jews from Judea said that the Gentile believers should be circumcised and should keep the law of Moses. Later the apostles and elders in Jerusalem made the decision not to ask these Gentile believers to keep the law. They only had to abstain from four things. Before the Gentiles were saved, they had "no law." After they were saved, the Bible does not ask them to keep the law. They were only asked to abstain from things that had been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. God has not given the law to the Gentiles. This is true both in the case of saved ones as well as unsaved ones.</p><h2 class="head3">The Law Being Given to the Jews</h2><p>When the Bible speaks of the law, it says that God gave the law to the Jews. The Jews are born under the law. To them, the heaven and the earth may pass away, but one iota or serif shall by no means pass away from the law. In Matthew 5:18 the Lord says that one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass. The Lord has no intention to annul the law among the Jews. His intention is to put the Jews under the law. He says that the law must be fulfilled. The fulfillment in this case is a kind of complement. Originally, the law said that one should not kill. Now not killing is not enough; one must not even hate. This is a kind of complement, and this is the way the law is to be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head3">The Law Having Nothing to Do<br />with Believing Jews</h2><p>Since the law is given to the Jews, what should the Jews who have believed in the Lord do? What is their relationship to the law? After a Jew is saved, he becomes a member of the church and is no longer a Jew. Romans 7:1-4 says that a Jew believing in the Lord is like a woman marrying a man. The woman in this case already had a husband&mdash;the law. In order for her to marry another man, her first husband must die. This is the only way. But Matthew says that not one iota or serif of the law can pass away. This husband&mdash;the law&mdash;will never die. What shall we do? This is the reason Romans 7:4 clearly shows us that the law controls a man only as long as he lives. Although the law, which is the husband, will not die, God caused Christ to die so that we, the woman, can die with Christ in Him. In this way we are freed from the law through death. We are freed from the first husband through dying with Christ. Then we are resurrected together with Christ and married to Christ the second husband. This death must be a real death. Only then will we not be an adulterer when we are given to Christ in resurrection. Within the Lord's death, God included our death. What an assurance this is! Our resurrection is included within the Lord's resurrection as well. How sure is this resurrection! To one who was under the law, it is a miracle to be able to receive a new life in resurrection through dying with the Lord. "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace" (6:14). This is so because the Lord has died. Since we have died to the binding law, we are now discharged from the law (7:6). By believing in the Lord and through participating in His death and resurrection, we are freed from the law. This is what happens to a Jew when he believes in the Lord. We must be clear about Romans 7 before we can deal with the question of the law. The law cannot be annulled. But we have died and have been liberated from the law. The Christian position is one that declares that we are dead. We stand on the position of death. We have been crucified with Christ. Today the law has nothing to do with us any longer. The law can only deal with the old man; it can do nothing to the new man that has passed through death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">The Function of the Law</h2><p>Some new believers may ask, "Since the law is a bondage to man, why did God give this law to man in the first place?" First, we have to realize that the law is not God's original thought; it was added later. It was instituted to meet certain needs, to deal with certain conditions. Galatians 3 expounds the function of the law in a very clear way. Verse 17 says, "A covenant previously ratified by God, the law, having come four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the promise of none effect." Verse 19 says, "Why then the law? It was added because of the transgressions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made." Verse 21 says, "Is then the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law." Verse 25 says, "But since faith has come, we are no longer under a child-conductor." These verses tell us the reason God gave the law in the Old Testament.</p><p>According to Galatians, four hundred and thirty years before God gave the law, He promised Abraham that he would be justified by faith and that through him all the nations of the earth would be blessed. Abraham is the father of faith. This means that his descendants are saved through faith. God's promise is His grace. The gospel was not yet announced, but there already was the promise. Justification by faith is something that God promised at the beginning. This shows that the law is not in God's original thought; grace is in God's original thought. In order for man to receive grace, however, he must realize his need. In order for man to receive salvation, he must first commit transgressions. If a man does not have a need, he will not receive grace. If a man has never transgressed, he will not want to be saved. In God's eyes, man is altogether a sinner, but man does not know that he is a sinner. This is the reason he does not come to God to receive grace. He has to commit some sins before he knows that he is a sinner and before he will come to God for grace. A man knows his sin through the law. When the law comes, transgression follows. Paul showed us that before he saw God's law about not coveting, he did not know covetousness. He was covetous, but he did not know that it was a sin. When God's law said, "You shall not covet," he knew that covetousness was a sin (Rom. 7:7-8). God says, "You shall not covet." If a man covets, he has transgressed against the law and sinned. This shows that the function of the law is to expose man's sin. Moses forbade the Israelites from worshipping any images. Before this time, the Israelites could have worshipped a thousand images and would not have known that it was sin. When Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets of stone, however, they realized it was sin to worship the calf.</p><p>Four hundred and thirty years before God gave the law, He preached the gospel to Abraham. His covenant with Abraham was that he would be justified by faith. Once God established this covenant, a law instituted four hundred and thirty years later could not annul it. Galatians 3:15 says, "Brothers, I speak according to man, though it is a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one nullifies it or makes additions to it." Once a covenant is established, it is impossible to add any more conditions to it or to delete anything from it. Some may ask: "Since God had established a covenant with Abraham, why did He give man the law four hundred and thirty years later? What was the purpose behind God's giving of the law?" In verse 19 Paul speaks of the function of the law: "It was added because of the transgressions." The law was added because of the transgressions. Once the law was added, there was transgression. Romans 4:15 says, "Where there is no law, neither is there transgression," and 5:20 says, "And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound." From Adam to Moses, sin was in the world, but man did not know about his sins because the law was not made manifest. Man's sins were manifested as transgressions only after the law was instituted. Man was sinful, but he was unable to receive God's grace because he did not know his condition. God gave the law so that man would fall into transgressions and know his true condition, thus humbling himself to accept grace. God gave the law so that His covenant would become effective, so that man would know that he is a sinner, and so that he would come to God to receive grace.</p><p>The law lies in waiting for the Lord Jesus to come. Matthew 11:13 says, "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." The function of the law is to fulfill the promise. God's goal is grace, while the law is merely the means. Man must go through the law before he can be ushered into grace. Does this mean that the law was against God's grace? Of course not. Paul said, "But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed. So then the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ" (Gal. 3:23-24). The law is God's servant; it leads us to Christ. Since we have touched Christ, we are no longer under the child-conductor. This means that we are no longer under the law. In the final analysis, God has not put us under the law. We are brought to Christ through the law, and from that point onward, we no longer follow the law. The law does not frustrate us. Before man is brought to Christ, the more he keeps the law the less he can go on. In the end he has to come to Christ. In this way the law fulfills grace. This is the function of the law.</p><h2 class="head3">Believers Not Being Perfected<br />by the Law after They Are Saved</h2><p>Some ask, "It is true that we are saved by Christ and not by the law. But after we are saved, should we not keep the law?" We have to study Galatians because it deals exclusively with this question. Before many people believed in the Lord, they mistakenly thought that they could be justified by the law. After they believe in the Lord, they still think that they should keep the law. Paul said that it is useless for a man to keep the law before he is justified. After he is justified, it is equally useless for him to keep the law. Paul wanted to show the Galatians that they were still unable to keep what they once could not keep. Let us see how Paul dealt with those who insisted that believers should keep the law. Some told the Galatians that they should keep the law after they were saved. In 1:6 Paul said, "I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel." Verse 7 continues, "Which is not another gospel, only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ." These ones made the gospel of Christ no longer a gospel. In verse 8 Paul spoke a strong word: "If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed." Then verse 9 says, "If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed." Paul said that those who were distracting the Galatians should be accursed. In 2:18 Paul said, "For if I build again the things which I have destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor." Paul said that those who preached another gospel should be accursed. He also said that if he were to build again the things which he had destroyed, that is, if he were to ask a saved person to keep the law again, he would prove himself to be a transgressor. Christ died to the law in order that we could live to Christ. Verse 20 says, "I am crucified with Christ." Since I am crucified with Christ, putting me under the law again would be unlawful. Although I am a living person, I am crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. We who live to Christ can no longer be placed under the law. The law only speaks to the natural man; it cannot speak to a dead man.</p><p>In verses 3:1 and 3 Paul spoke to the Galatians: "O foolish Galatians...are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?" Paul was saying that the law only addresses those who are in the flesh. Galatians 5:22 and 23 say that there is no law against the fruit of the Spirit. This means that the fruit of the Spirit is not under the control of the law. Since it is not under the control of the law, the same Holy Spirit in us would never lead us to keep the law. The law is only meant for those in the flesh. Those who break the law are in the flesh, and those who keep the law are also in the flesh. Once the law comes, the flesh becomes active, and the Holy Spirit is stifled because the flesh wars with the Spirit. Once a man tries to keep the law, the flesh is activated. If a man does not try to keep the law, the flesh will not move. The target of the law is the flesh. Galatians 3 clearly shows that we cannot be justified by the law. Since we have begun by the Spirit, we cannot go back to the law. Today many Christians still carry the flavor of Judaism. We have to be on the alert. Not only are there Judaizers in the church, we may become a Judaizer ourselves if we are not careful. Some do not understand God's plan and arrangement in His redemption; they only pay attention to the things of the law and thus make themselves Judaizers.</p><p>Since a Christian does not need to keep the law, does this mean that he can break the law? Please notice that God's intention for giving man the law was not for man to keep it. God never says that those who keep the law will satisfy His heart. God did not give man the law with the intention that he would keep it, but with the intention that he would gain the righteousness of the law. We have to differentiate between the law and the righteousness of the law. Not being covetous, honoring one's parents, and refraining from idolatry&mdash;these are the righteousnesses of the law. God does not want man to keep the law but to gain the righteousness of the law. In summary, God's intention in instituting the law is as follows: First, He apparently wants man to keep the law, but only for the purpose of exposing him so that he would see the futility of his flesh. Second, He wants man to inherit the righteousness of the law. Third, He wants man to have His life. In order to have life, a man cannot be lawless. Without the righteousness of the law, he cannot receive life. When man inherits Christ as his righteousness, he inherits life as well. According to the law, a man receives the righteousness of the law and inherits life if he keeps the law (Lev. 18:5). Today we can inherit the righteousness of the law and have life without keeping the law. As long as we believe in the Lord, we become righteous (Gal. 2:16), and we have life. But after we have inherited life, the Judaizers say that we should keep the law in order to gain the righteousness of the law. This is wrong. Once a man tries to keep the law, the old man is revived. We are saved when God puts us into the death of Christ. We inherit righteousness through the blood of the Lord, and we receive life by inheriting righteousness. This life is not under the law. If we want to keep the law, our flesh will have to keep it. When we try to keep the law, the flesh is revived. The new life the Lord has given us is not under the law; rather, it fulfills the righteousness of law automatically within us.</p><h2 class="head3">Fulfilling the Righteousness of the Law</h2><p>After we receive the new life, we should realize that the righteousness of the law can be ours without trying to keep the law. Romans 8:4 says, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit." Since we have received life in the spirit, we do not need to gain the righteousness of the law through keeping the law. "Do not covet"&mdash;this is a law. But not coveting is a righteousness of the law. The Judaizers say, "Do not covet," yet they cannot free themselves from covetousness. They say, "Keep the law," yet they cannot keep it (Rom. 3:20). They do not have any righteousness. We can be free from covetousness through the righteousness that comes from the life of Christ. We can gain the righteousness of the law without keeping the law. This is the gospel. A Christian does not covet because he is walking according to the Spirit, not because there is the law forbidding covetousness. When he walks according to the Spirit, he fulfills the righteous requirement of the law. This is the true gospel. The law is not an end in itself. The end of the law is righteousness. God brings us to righteousness through another avenue; we do not gain righteousness through keeping the law. Keeping the law is useless, both before and after salvation. When we were saved, we were justified, not through the law, but through crucifixion with the Lord. We were saved by the righteousness of God. Having begun by the Spirit, we should continue with the Spirit. The Spirit accomplishes the righteousness within us.</p><p>Galatians 4:9 says, "But now, having come to know God, or rather having been known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and poor elements, to which you desire to be enslaved yet again?" Galatians 5:1 says, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again." God wants us no longer to be the slaves of the law; He does not want us to be entangled with its yoke again. Romans 7:4 says, "So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God." Everyone who has received life has been joined to Christ. A Christian has died with Christ through His death. He has also risen with Christ and is now married to Him. Actually not only have we received a life, but we have been joined to Christ's life. A saved person is one who is risen from the dead and who is joined to Christ. When we are joined to Him, we are married to Him. The Galatians wanted to go back to their former husband&mdash;the law. Anyone who tries to turn us back to the law is trying to make us an adulterer. This is to be accursed.</p><p>Romans 7:4b says, "So that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God." We do not refrain from idols just because the law says that we should refrain from them. We refrain from idols because the Holy Spirit is bearing His fruit in us. We have the righteousness of the law, but this righteousness is not produced through keeping the law; it is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. After we are saved, we can gain the righteousness of the law without keeping the law. We are not saying that after a man is saved he does not need to keep the law and that he can sin at will. We are saved by grace, and the Lord's life is in us. Spontaneously we will not sin. This is the fruit of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Particular Error of the Judaizers<br />concerning the Keeping of Sabbath</h2><p>The Ten Commandments which Moses instituted speak of keeping the Sabbath. Even today the Jews are still keeping it. The church began keeping the Sabbath from the time of Smyrna. Lapsed Jews who returned from Rome to Smyrna brought the Old Testament law which they held dearly into the church life. After the Roman Catholic Church gained prominence, Judaism became more mixed up with Christianity. For over a thousand years, the church considered the Lord's Day as the Christian Sabbath. In the last century, Judaizers have reappeared, supporting the keeping of the Sabbath. They have lifted high the Ten Commandments in their chapels and made Saturday their Sabbath day. They have changed the Jewish Sabbath day into a Christian Sabbath day, making this Sabbath the Lord's Day. But Christians should not keep the Sabbath; we are not obligated by the fourth commandment. We cannot even make the seventh day the Sabbath day. This is not a matter of which day the Sabbath should fall on. The basic issue is that Christians should not keep a Sabbath at all because they are not under the law.</p><h2 class="head2">Refutation of the Particular Error<br />of the Judaizers concerning<br />the Keeping of Sabbath</h2><h2 class="head3">The Sabbath Being for Jews Only</h2><p>Let us now come to the teaching of the Bible concerning the Sabbath. In the Bible the first mention of the Sabbath is in Genesis 2:3. After God finished His work of creation, He rested on the seventh day. After this, there was no mention of the Sabbath until two thousand and five hundred years later. In Exodus 16:29 God gave the Sabbath to His people. Then He made the keeping of the Sabbath a law and told the Israelites to keep this law: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" (20:8). In Exodus 31:13 and 17 Jehovah said to the Israelites, "Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations....It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever." In Ezekiel 20:12 He said that He gave the Sabbath to the children of Israel for the purpose of sanctifying them and making them His people. God told the Israelites that the keeping of the Sabbath was a sign of their deliverance from Egypt (Deut. 5:12-15). From these verses we see clearly that the Sabbath was given by God to the Jews as a sign that they were the redeemed people.</p><h2 class="head3">The Handwriting in the Law Being Wiped Out</h2><p>Let us now consider Paul's teaching concerning the Sabbath. He said that the Sabbath is a thing of the past. In Colossians 2:13-14 he said, "And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses; wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross." The handwriting refers to the entire law. The Lord wiped out the entire law on the cross because this law was against us and contrary to us. The Lord demands holiness, yet we are sinful. According to the law, we can never be justified. This is the reason it says that the law is against us and contrary to us. By being crucified for us, the Lord wiped out the law. We are now able to come to God. The Judaizers say that the Lord's crucifixion only removed the ceremonial law, not the moral law. They say that the moral law still stands, but Paul said that the Lord has wiped out all the laws.</p><p>In reality the Bible does not make a clear distinction between moral laws and ceremonial laws. The Judaizers say that the new moon and the feasts belong to the ceremonial laws; these have indeed been wiped away. But they say that the Ten Commandments belong to the moral laws and should still be kept. The Bible does not teach this. It does not separate moral laws from ceremonial laws. All ceremonial laws are moral in nature. The sacrifices are moral, and the ordinances regarding eating and drinking are moral in significance. This is like the fourth commandment in the Decalog&mdash;the keeping of the Sabbath; it is moral in nature. Colossians shows clearly that the entire handwriting in ordinances was wiped out, not just the ceremonial laws. The handwriting refers to the document of a covenant. It is like a contract, a signed pledge. Exodus 19:8 tells us that after God gave the Ten Commandments, the Israelites responded immediately, saying, "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do." They did not make a distinction between ceremonial and moral laws. Hence, the handwriting includes the moral laws; it does not refer merely to ceremonial laws. We have to point out to new ones the meaning of this handwriting so that they will know that all the handwriting of the law that was against us and contrary to us was wiped out and nailed to the cross.</p><p>Romans 7:7 speaks of the existence of the law, while Colossians 2:14 shows us that the law is wiped out and crucified. Verse 16 follows verse 14, saying, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath." The entire law has been wiped out before God. We can quote Exodus 19:8 and show them that the Jews did not make a distinction between ceremonial and moral laws. The only way for us to deal with the Judaizers is to tell them that the law is not separated into parts. Colossians 2:16 says that since the law is wiped out, everything related to eating, drinking, feasts, new moon, or the Sabbath should be done away with. These things have nothing whatsoever to do with a Christian. The Judaizers may respond by saying that the Sabbath does not refer to the regular Sabbath in a week, but the Sabbaths within the feasts. But they should know better that the word Sabbaths in Colossians is plural, as the word feasts is also plural. This includes all the Sabbaths and feasts of the Jews. Since Sabbaths is plural, there is no distinction as to whether the weekly Sabbath or the feast-time Sabbaths are referred to; both are included. The more inclusive term always includes the less inclusive ones. Any Sabbath is included in the word Sabbaths. No one can say that weekly Sabbaths are not included in Sabbaths. Paul knew the Jews in Colossae; they never paid attention to the feast-time Sabbath. To them the important thing was the weekly Sabbaths. This is the reason Paul wrote a letter and told them that a Christian is free from feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths. Only recently can we find men making a distinction between weekly Sabbaths and feast-time Sabbaths. In verse 17 Paul said, "Which are a shadow of the things to come." They are not worthy of judgment. No Christian should allow another to judge him in these things. The which in verse 17 refers to all the things spoken of in verse 16. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is Christ. If we read further, we will be clear that both the ceremonial as well as the moral laws are gone.</p><p>When we come to the "law regarding the husband" in Romans 7:2, the Judaizers again argue that this refers to the ceremonial law. This is absurd. Verse 7 says, "Neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, `You shall not covet.'" The Judaizers readily concede that this law is part of the Ten Commandments, and therefore, is moral, not ceremonial. From its context, however, we can see that this law, as one of the commandments of the Decalog, is the very "law regarding the husband" spoken of in verse 2. The Judaizers contradict what they say. Actually, we are free from all laws, moral or ceremonial. When Paul said that we are freed from our husband, he was referring to the law of the Ten Commandments. Through our crucifixion with Christ, we are freed from the first husband, which is to be freed from all the laws.</p><p>Second Corinthians 3:7, 9 through 10, and 13 show the difference between the ministry of the law and the ministry of the spirit; it shows the difference between Moses' ministry and Christ's ministry. The law which is engraved on the stone belongs to the ministry of death; it is a ministry of condemnation and is to be done away with. "The end of that which was being done away with" clearly refers to the law. The Judaizers admit that the law kills, but they resort to their only excuse, saying that this refers to the ceremonial law. We know that not all the laws were engraved in stone; only the moral laws, that is, the Decalog, were engraved. The ceremonial laws were never engraved in stone. Moses' ministry is a ministry of death engraved in stone. Clearly, the ministry that will be done away with includes the moral law. Today this law is engraved in our heart. In 2 Corinthians 3:3 we see only a contrast between the tablets of stone and the tablets of the heart. We are freed from all the laws, including the ceremonial laws and the moral laws.</p><h2 class="head3">It Being All Right to Regard<br />or Not to Regard the Day</h2><p>Today God has given Christ to us through the Holy Spirit to be our righteousness. There is no longer any need to keep the law. The matter of the Sabbath is a thing of the past. Romans 14:5 says that some judge one day above another, while others judge every day alike. Verses 1 through 6 of this chapter deal with two things: keeping or not keeping the day and eating or not eating meat. Some are vegetarians; they do not take meat. Paul said that these ones are weak in faith or weak in conscience. He also said that those who keep the day are weak in faith. In the Old Testament if a man would not keep the Sabbath, he would be stoned to death. In the New Testament when the Lord Jesus came, the Jews tried to kill Him because He did not keep the Sabbath. They were stopped, however, by a miracle. At the time of Paul, the apostle said that one day is the same as another day; all days are the same. What a great change! All days are the same. Keeping the Sabbath is a moral law; it is one of the items of the moral law. Consider the law: "Do not commit adultery." One cannot say that both those who commit adultery and those who do not commit adultery are all right, and that those who commit it commit it to the Lord and those who do not commit it do not commit it to the Lord. The keeping of the Sabbath does not earn one the righteousness of the law; it is a shadow of things that are coming. There is one part within the law which has to do with types. There is another part which has to do with righteousness. The types are already fulfilled. We cannot separate the law into ceremonial and moral parts, like the Judaizers do. However, we can say that a part of the law is typological and that these types are all fulfilled in the Lord Jesus. This means that we have a dispensational change.</p><p>In the Old Testament we find numerous commandments on keeping the Sabbath. But these commandments are for the Jews. By the time the kingdom comes, the Jews will still keep the Sabbath and offer sacrifices. In the New Testament Paul did not exhort anyone to keep the Sabbath, not even once. It would be surprising indeed if one should keep the Sabbath and the New Testament did not say anything about it. We can see that the dispensation has changed. We can see this clearly in the conference in Acts 15. Verse 22 of that chapter says that the apostles, the elders, and the whole church were gathered together. If the Sabbath was important, some decision should have been reached in the conference regarding it. It would be strange indeed for Christians to keep the Sabbath without finding any references to that decision. This shows that the Sabbath must be over. The New Testament tells us that according to God's plan, "all the prophets and the law prophesied until John" (Matt. 11:13). In God's work Christ is the end of the law. In the New Testament the Lord does not charge men to keep the law. Colossians says that the Sabbath is over. Paul said that it is all right to keep or not to keep the day. None of us live to ourselves, and none of us die to ourselves. Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.</p><p>Finally, we have to see that nothing in the New Testament can be fulfilled by borrowing things from the Old Testament. The Roman Catholic Church says that keeping the Lord's Day is a keeping of the Christian Sabbath. This mixes Judaism with Christianity. Once the Judaizers come in, they try to bring the entire Jewish religion in. If anyone wants to keep the Sabbath, that man is not a Christian. Just as it is wrong for a Christian to keep the Chinese mid-autumn festival, it is wrong for him to keep the Sabbath. If we accept the Judaizers, we might as well throw away all hint of Christianity and simply become a pure Jew. Paul spoke in Galatians 4:10-11 to the Galatians: "You observe days and months and seasons and years..."&mdash;which include the Sabbaths and the Jubilee&mdash;"I fear for you, lest I have labored upon you in vain." Keeping the Sabbath annuls grace. We have to guard against the Judaizers' attempt to bring in the Sabbath.</p><h2 class="head3">A Final Word&mdash;the Law and the Sabbath<br />Being Altogether Over</h2><p>The Acts of the Apostles is a record of the history of Christianity; it does not give explanations to the facts. It only contains history, not doctrines. The whole body of truth from God, as presented in the entire Bible, was not completed until A.D. 96, which is the time of the fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy to His disciples when He said that the Spirit of truth would come and would bring them into all truths. It was also at that time that the power and influence of Judaism gradually disappeared from Christianity. At the time of the Lord's death, there was not yet a complete presentation of the Christian faith. The complete picture of the Christian faith gradually emerged and was not completed until the writing of the Epistles. We have to understand the progression of the Christian faith. In Acts 15 we do not see any dispute for the Sabbath. There was only the dispute for circumcision. Later, Paul even went up to the temple to take care of his vow. It is not surprising for the Jews to want circumcision, because they always wanted to draw back. I hope that the brothers will see the beginning, the development, and the completion of the Christian faith. Only then will we be able to ascertain the proper faith of a Christian.</p><p>At the beginning of the New Testament, when our Lord was on earth, He kept both the Sabbath and the circumcision. In Galatians the matter of the Sabbath was settled, and the matter of circumcision was also settled. Some of Paul's Epistles were written after A.D. 70, and it was then that a proper standing for the Christian faith was established. Before that time, the temple, the priests, and the law were still present. It was still easy for men to straddle the fence. It was still easy for men to enjoy two kinds of lambs. It was easy to hold onto Judaism on the one hand and to believe in Jesus on the other hand. This is the reason Paul wrote the book of Hebrews. The last clause in Hebrews 10:26 says, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins." Christ has been offered as our sacrifice. No one can straddle the fence any longer. Here we see the great advancement and development of the Christian faith! Any truth, however, must receive its final verdict from the Word of God. Concerning the law and the Sabbath, the final word is in Colossians 2:14: "Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross." The law and the Sabbath are completely over. If the temple and the priesthood are still with us today, we will have a problem. It is easy for the Judaizers to bring in all kinds of "halfway" items. We have to remember one basic principle: In making a judgment concerning any truth in the Bible, we must not stop halfway. The Sabbath and the law are all "halfway" things. In teaching about the Sabbath, the Judaizers are bringing in Old Testament items that have been annulled already.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE JUDAIZERS</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h2 class="head1">THE JUDAIZERS' ERROR<br />CONCERNING THE LORD'S REDEMPTION</h2><h2 class="head2">The Judaizers' Erroneous Interpretation<br />of Prophecies</h2><p>The Judaizers are ignorant and befuddled about the truth concerning redemption. They do not have the Lord's gospel of redemption for the sinners. Their understanding of Christ's redemption is altogether based on their way of interpreting Old Testament prophecies. This interpretation is peculiar and childish. Their basic principle of prophetic interpretation is to regard a day in the Bible as a year.</p><p>First, they base their argument on God's word to the Israelites in Numbers 14:34: "According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquities, forty years, and you shall know My displeasure." The Israelites spent forty days to spy out the land. Because of their unbelief, Jehovah punished them by allowing them to wander in the wilderness for forty years so that they would know His displeasure. God's punishment of the Israelites with forty years of wandering is unrelated to prophecy. One cannot take this word and say that in every instance a day should be interpreted as a year. There is no prophetic significance in this passage. It is not a prophecy. God merely stated that He would punish the Israelites for forty years. Yet this forms the basis of these ones' interpretation of the prophecies. Can this be a principle in prophetic interpretation? We will prove the error of such an assumption from the Bible.</p><p>Second, the Judaizers promote this teaching by using Ezekiel 4:4-6. Jehovah told Ezekiel to lie upon his left side for three hundred and ninety days on behalf of the iniquities of the house of Israel and to lie upon his right side for forty days on behalf of the iniquities of the house of Judah. Each day would account for a year of their iniquities. Here again the issue is punishment. It was one day for a year. If it was one year for a day of iniquities, Ezekiel would have needed to lie on his bed all his life. Here God told Ezekiel only to lie for a day for every year of the Israelites' iniquities. Other than these two instances, there is no other place in the Old Testament that takes a day as a year. Both these cases refer to punishment, not to prophecy. Suppose a mother wants to spank her child three times. Is that a prophecy or is that a punishment? Clearly that is a punishment, not a prophecy; it has nothing to do with prophecy. The stories spoken of in these two passages are clearly related to God's punishment of the Israelites. They are the only two cases where such a parallel is drawn, and they are isolated cases. This application is not general and does not apply to every instance. It is very dangerous to take these two things and apply them as principles to prophetic interpretation.</p><h2 class="head2">Refutation of the Judaizers' Erroneous Interpretation of Prophecies</h2><p>Many verses in the Bible refer to a day as a day and to a year as a year. No one can say that these passages are wrong. In the Bible a day is a day, not a year. We can prove this with many verses. In Genesis 7:4 God said, "For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights." If we take the Judaizers' word, a day would be a year, and this would mean that God would have to wait for seven years before He would send the rain. But verse 10 says that after seven days the flood came and deluged the earth. Verse 12 says that for forty days and nights the rain fell. The forty days and nights were actual days and nights; they were not forty years.</p><p>In Genesis 40:12 Joseph interpreted the dream to the butler, saying, "The three branches are three days." Verse 13 says, "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place." Verse 20 says, "And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants." The butler indeed resumed his service. Here three days means three days, not three years.</p><p>In Joshua 1:11 Joshua commanded the officers of the people to say to the congregation, "Prepare provisions for yourselves, for in three days you are crossing this Jordan to enter and possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess." Joshua 3:2 says, "And at the end of three days..." In verse 16 the people followed the ark and crossed the Jordan. Here again three days meant three days, not three years.</p><p>In the New Testament, Matthew 12:40 says, "For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights." Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, not three years. We know that the Lord rose up from the dead after three days, not three years.</p><p>In Revelation 2:10 the Lord told the church in Smyrna: "You will have tribulation for ten days." Ten days is ten days, not ten years.</p><p>Revelation 20:2 and 4 say that Satan will be bound for a thousand years and that God's overcomers and the martyrs will reign for a thousand years. If a day equals a year, this would mean 365,000 years. This is wrong; it is entirely without any scriptural basis.</p><p>From the above verses, we see that a day is a day and a year is a year. There is no prophecy which says that a day should be treated as a year. Only curious minds invented such principles as a day for a year. The two passages that the Judaizers quote are not related to prophecy. They base their understanding of redemption on their interpretation of prophecy according to the day-year postulate. This is wrong.</p><h2 class="head2">The Judaizers' Interpretation<br />of the Lord's Redemption Based on Daniel 8</h2><p>Another error of the Judaizers is their interpretation of the vision in Daniel 8. They explain Daniel 8:3-25 by saying that the little horn refers to Rome. This is altogether wrong and in darkness. Daniel saw the vision of the ram in 8:3 and 4 and the vision of the male goat in verses 5 to 14. In verses 20 and 21 he interprets the ram to be Persia, and the male goat to be the king of Greece. (Of course, to new ones we need not give such details.) Verse 5 says that the male goat has a conspicuous horn between his eyes. Verse 8 says that this horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven. After a while these four horns also passed away. Verse 9 then says that out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which was beautiful. And it grew great. Here we have three periods. The big horn refers to Alexander; he was the first king of Greece. Verse 22 says that after this horn was broken, four other horns were produced. This refers to the four kingdoms produced by the Greek empire after the time of Alexander. Verse 23 says that when the transgressions of these four kingdoms were filled up, a king would arise, which would be the little horn. This means that in the future, a little horn will come. This is the Antichrist. Daniel 8:9-14 tells us about this little horn. According to this passage, the little horn is exceedingly fierce. "That which is beautiful" in verse 9 refers to the land of Judah. To cause some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth and to trample them refers to the arrogance of the Antichrist who will attempt to confront God and to destroy His sanctuary. Because of the transgression, he will throw down the truth and the sacrifices among the children of Israel, and he will take action and prosper. When will all these be fulfilled? Verse 14 says, "For two thousand three hundred nights and days; then the sanctuary will be restored."</p><p>We can summarize the above in this way: 1) The little horn is the Antichrist, which will come out of Greece. 2) He will carry out his activities within the sanctuary. During the tribulation, the Israelites will have a rebuilt sanctuary and will offer sacrifices there. But the sacrificial service will be handed over to the Antichrist. 3) The sanctuary will be delivered to the Antichrist for 2,300 days. This is the period of time during which the Antichrist will occupy the sanctuary.</p><p>Based on Daniel 8:14, the Judaizers concocted the theory that when the Lord died on the cross, He shed His blood to redeem us from sin; yet the job was not completed. He had to wait until 2,300 years were fulfilled, when He would come again and bring the redeeming blood to heaven, that is, to the heavenly sanctuary. He would then cleanse the sanctuary and come back. They say that a day is a year, and 2,300 days means 2,300 years. But one cannot make a day a year here in Daniel 8 because the sanctuary was never trampled for that long. The Judaizers start counting from 457 B.C., the time of the little horn. This brings them to the year A.D. 1844. They say that this is the time when the little horn trampled the sanctuary. But this is contrary to facts. Their interpretation is unfounded. The 2,300 days in 8:14 are literally 2,300 nights and 2,300 days. It cannot refer to 2,300 years.</p><p>From where did this interpretation of the Judaizers come? In the last century there was a man called William Miller, who was with the Seventh-day Adventists. After he read Daniel 8, he proposed interpreting a day as a year and taught that from the time the sanctuary was trampled, which was 457 B.C., until A.D. 1844, there were 2,300 years. He expected the Lord to come by 1844. In that year he sold all he had. He got rid of all his belongings and went up to the mountain in the afternoon to wait for the Lord. When the Lord did not come as expected, he said that his calculation was wrong, and that the Lord should come in November of that year instead. When November came around, the Lord still did not come. Those who followed him and who had sold all their possessions fell into a very embarrassing condition. After this incident, many went back to the world. This is a terrible teaching of the Judaizers. But there are about two hundred thousand people who believe in this. How do they explain Miller's blunder? They say that the Lord did not come to the earth in 1844, but entered the heavenly sanctuary. In 1844 the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven and entered the sanctuary. Later, He also entered the Holy of Holies. Some naturally ask, "What has the Lord been doing in the sanctuary since 1844?" They say that He is there as the priest. They say that the Lord did not cleanse the sanctuary until 1844 and that He is there as the priest and is continuing the cleansing work. This is absolutely wrong. For the Judaizers to emphasize the Sabbath is one thing, but when they touch the Lord's person and His work, they touch something serious. They say that the Lord did not enter the sanctuary to do the cleansing work until 1844. This heretical teaching of the Judaizers is too absurd. Yet many children of God choose to believe in them.</p><h2 class="head2">Refutation of the Judaizers'<br />Erroneous Interpretation<br />of the Lord's Redemption</h2><p>Let us see what the Bible says about the Lord's blood and His redemption. First, the Bible shows us that redemption is carried out on the altar. Leviticus 4:5 and 7 say that the blood of atonement is shed on the altar. Verse 20 and 26 show us clearly that as soon as the blood is shed on the altar, God forgives man. Once the priest offers the sacrifice on the altar, man's sin is forgiven. There is no need to enter the sanctuary. Many sins are absolved without the priest entering the sanctuary. Verses 7 and 18 say that for ordinary sins, the priest can offer sacrifices on the altar to absolve a sinner's guilt. We have to remember that there is no need to enter the sanctuary for the atonement of sin.</p><p>Second, the Judaizers say that before 1844, the Lord remained only in the Holy Place during the 2,300 year period and that He did not enter the inner sanctuary. This is unscriptural. Matthew 27:51 clearly tells us that when the Lord died, the veil in the temple was split from top to bottom. The temple became one, and there was no longer a division into two compartments. Which compartment are the Judaizers trying to re-enact? Hebrews 9:2-3 and 10:19-20 both show that there are not two compartments in the sanctuary any longer; there is only one place. We are brought directly into the Holy of Holies. It is hard to understand why the Judaizers insist that the Lord was in the Holy Place, the outer compartment. They say that the Lord did not enter the Holy of Holies until 1844. But before 1844 an entrance was secured for Christians to boldly enter the Holy of Holies already. What a heresy we have here! According to their teaching, prior to 1844 the veil was still with us, and the way to the Holy of Holies was still not manifest. Yet all the while Christians had been able to enter boldly the Holy of Holies! In other words, Christians entered the Holy of Holies before Christ did. What a heresy this is! The Judaizers have indeed introduced heretical Jewish teachings into the church.</p><p>Third, we have to note that in the atoning work in the Old Testament, only the high priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies; no other person was allowed to enter. Leviticus 16:17 says, "No man shall be in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make propiation for himself in the holy of holies." When the high priest was making sacrifices of atonement, no one could enter the tabernacle. If the Lord is doing the atoning work in the Holy of Holies, none of us can enter the sanctuary. It is impossible for God to leave the Lord in the Holy Place while fellowshipping with us in the Holy of Holies. It is equally impossible for us to be in the Holy of Holies before the Lord is in the Holy of Holies. The Judaizers have confused the gospel completely.</p><p>Fourth, another serious problem raised by the Judaizers is that according to them our High Priest, the Lord Jesus, was still making atonement for sin in the Holy Place in 1844. But how could sin be in the Holy Place at that time? The Judaizers say that the Lord's blood brought sin into the Holy Place. But we believe that the Lord's blood cleanses us from sin; His blood did not carry our sin into the sanctuary. It is a blasphemy to say this. It is a serious heresy. The Lord accomplished redemption when He died on the cross. Mrs. White said that the Lord's blood carried our sin to the Holy Place. What a blasphemy! In 1 Corinthians 15:17 Paul told the Corinthians that if Christ had not been raised, their faith was futile and they would still be in their sins. Romans 4:25 also says that the Lord was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification. Before the Lord resurrected, our sins were forgiven already. This is the reason the Lord could resurrect. If the Son of God was not successful in redeeming our sins, He could not have resurrected; He would have been detained by God. But some are saying that before 1844, the problem of sin was still not resolved. If that is the case, the Lord could not have resurrected. The Lord has indeed resurrected, and our sins are indeed over. Since the Lord has resurrected, He is no longer in the outer sanctuary. This teaching is absolutely unscriptural, and it is a heresy.</p><p>Fifth, the Bible tells us that the Lord has entered the Holy of Holies and has appeared before God for us (Heb. 9:24), testifying that the sins of those on earth are atoned. He brought the blood before the throne of grace, which is in the Holy of Holies. When God sees the blood, He answers man's prayer and forgives his sins. This is the real fact. What the Judaizers are saying is heresy, a very serious heresy.</p><p>Sixth, the Lord Jesus' offering of the sacrifice of sin and His becoming the High Priest are two different things. The Bible only says that the Lord redeemed us from sin by becoming a sacrifice Himself. It does not say that the Lord became the High Priest for the purpose of atoning our sins. Hebrews 4:15 and 16 say that the Lord Jesus acts as our High Priest to take care of our weaknesses, not our sins. Taking care of sin and taking care of weaknesses are two entirely different things. The Lord is not taking care of our sin in heaven now. He is sympathizing with our weaknesses and interceding for us.</p><p>Seventh, we have to be clear about the relationship between the Lord becoming our High Priest and His dealing with our sins. Hebrews 3:1, 8:1, 10:12, and 12:2 all tell us that as our priest the Lord Jesus has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty on high. Since He has sat down, it means that He has finished the cleansing work in us. This is the reason He sat down. Christianity gives us first the sacrifice to deal with our sins before giving us the priest to deal with our weaknesses. This is not the case with the Judaizers. With them the two things occur at the same time. We have to read Hebrew 10:12 to the new ones: "But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God." He sat down before God before He was a priest to us. The priests in the Old Testament, as Hebrews 10:11 indicates, stood daily before God to minister to Him. The Lord presented His blood to God once, and He sat down. He did not continue atoning for sin; He sat down. Hebrews 9:26 says, "But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself." Hebrews 10:17-18 also says that the Lord will not remember our sins and lawlessnesses anymore. Since the sins are forgiven, there is no need to sacrifice for sin anymore. One sacrifice for sin is enough. The Judaizers try to drag us back to the Jewish position of the Old Testament. They do not want us to see the clear redemptive work of the Lord. This is indeed an evil teaching.</p><p>We have to know that the 2,300 days is the period when the Antichrist will trample under his feet the sanctuary of the Jews. The Judaizers say that there is the need to purify the sanctuary because the blood brought to the sanctuary carried sin with it, defiling the sanctuary so that the sanctuary must be purified before the Lord can come back. This is another evil teaching of the Judaizers. We have to reject this heresy utterly. We cannot have fellowship with Catholics, and we cannot have fellowship with the Judaizers either. They are blasphemers of the Lord. We have no way to communicate with them, because they do not have the right perception of things. We cannot tolerate any teaching that infringes upon the person or work of Christ; such teaching is heresy. If we are careless in this matter, we are not a true lover of the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE JUDAIZERS</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h2 class="head1">THE JUDAIZERS' ERRONEOUS CONCEPT<br />CONCERNING LIFE AFTER DEATH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Judaizers' Erroneous Concept<br />concerning Life after Death</h2><p>Let us go on to see the Judaizers' concept concerning life after death. In other words, let us consider their concept about final judgment. In this matter the Judaizers make two serious mistakes. First, they believe that death is a kind of sleep in which the spirit, soul, and body all become dormant and lose all consciousness. Second, they say that after resurrection, there is no final judgment. They believe that after a man dies, his body, soul, and spirit are all annihilated. When we meet such ones, they will tell us this kind of teaching because this is their basic doctrine.</p><h2 class="head2">Refutation of the Judaizers' Erroneous Concept<br />concerning Life after Death</h2><p>Is their teaching concerning the spirit and soul being asleep accurate? Let us find the answer from the Bible. The Bible does say that when a man dies, he is asleep, but this refers to the body, not to the soul. The Judaizers confuse the sleeping of the soul with the sleeping of the body. This is absolutely wrong. There are many passages in the Bible to refute this error. Matthew 27:52 says, "And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised." Here it clearly says that the bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised. It is the body that is asleep, not the soul. John 11:11 says, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may wake him out of sleep." This also refers to the body. When Stephen was stoned in Acts 7:59 and 60, he cried, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!" Following this it says, "He fell asleep." Stephen's body was stoned to death. Clearly, sleeping refers to the sleeping of the body. First Corinthians 7:39 says, "Should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes." This clearly refers to the body also. First Corinthians 11:30 says, "Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep." Paul said that some in the church in Corinth were weak and sick. Both of these things refer to the body. We cannot say that weakness and sickness refer to the weakness and sickness of the soul. Therefore, sleeping in the very same verse must refer to the sleeping of the body, not to the soul.</p><p>First Corinthians 15:5-6 tells us that after Christ resurrected, He showed Himself to the apostles. "Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now." The five hundred brothers who remained until then were remaining in the body. The next clause but some have fallen asleep must also refer to the body, not to the soul. Verse 18 says, "Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished." Who are the ones who have fallen asleep in Christ? Verses 16 and 17 say, "For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins." The sleeping ones in verse 18 refer to those who have slept in the body. Since this is the case, when verse 20 speaks of Christ having resurrected and having become the firstfruits, it refers to His body being raised from the dead; it does not refer to the resurrection of the soul. Hence, after the Lord resurrected, He purposely showed Himself to Thomas to tell him, "I have a body. You can touch Me." He wanted Thomas to touch His resurrected body. His resurrected body became the firstfruits. All fruits that come after the firstfruits, of course, bear the same resemblance as the firstfruits. He resurrected in His body. All those who have slept will also resurrect in the body. We who have believed in Him will be the same as the Lord is in resurrection, because our sleep is the same as the Lord's sleep. Hence, there is no sleeping of the soul, only sleeping of the body.</p><p>The Lord's own words also contradict the Judaizers' teaching. For example, in the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-23, we find "a certain rich man...making merry every day in splendor. And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate....And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried. And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment." Both Lazarus and the rich man died, but their souls did not die or sleep. The rich man died and was buried. It must have been a very splendid burial. Yet after his death he suffered in Hades. Lazarus also died, but he rested in the bosom of Abraham. If this story stands, the Judaizers' teaching does not stand. In studying the Bible we have to learn to know what the Bible says. We preach according to what we believe. It is strange that some can conclude that the soul sleeps from such a passage. It is clear that an unbeliever's soul suffers after he dies, while a believer's soul is comforted after he dies. But these ones force their argument by quoting Scriptures that they do not understand. They are tainted in their concept. They like to say that the soul sleeps. Here, however, it says explicitly that the rich man did not sleep; he was suffering in Hades. It is a foolish thing for man to try to erase the feeling of sin by claiming that the soul will go to sleep.</p><p>The Judaizers have two things to say about this passage. First they say that this is a parable of the Lord. We know that in Luke 15 and 18, the Lord uses parables. But when he uses parables, He clearly says that He is speaking in parables. In Luke 16 the Lord does not say that He is speaking in parables. The other argument of the Judaizers is that this is merely a story. However, we should note the following facts. First, the Lord uses the names of some of the people. Abraham, Moses, and Lazarus were all real men. Second, the Lord gives many details in this so-called story. He speaks about the way the people lived while they were living, about the dogs, the sores, the rich man's suffering after his death, and his imploring for Lazarus to go to his brothers. Outwardly this is a story, but it is full of divine teaching. If this is merely a story, how can it cover all the conscious activities of a person after his death? How can such ones have these feelings of suffering and comfort? Through this story the Lord reveals the picture of a person after death. If this were a parable, at most it would contain a simple story to illustrate the point. For example, in preaching the gospel we sometimes illustrate our point by briefly speaking about a brother's repentance. Even if this were a parable, there must be some reality behind the various references. If a man does not have any feeling after he dies, such a parable would be useless. If the rich man does have feelings after he dies, this story cannot be treated merely as a parable. The Judaizers are too bold. Their teaching is absolutely based on the erroneous concept of Judaism. These ones are cut off from the revelation of God's word. They just want to hold on to their own concept. They have no regard for the Scripture.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 5:8 Paul said, "We are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord." In Philippians 1:23 he said, "But I am constrained between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for this is far better." Even the Judaizers admit that the Lord is resurrected. How can we be with the Lord if our souls are still asleep? If a man has no consciousness after he dies, how can his presence with the Lord be felt? Paul said that it is better to be with Christ. Without a consciousness of the better presence, no one will want to be a martyr for Christ. Stephen said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!" The Bible says that after a man dies he will still have consciousness. For a person to consider death to be better means that he has more feelings in death than when he is alive. This proves that a man still has consciousness after he dies. If unbelievers do not have to suffer after death, the power of our gospel will be much diminished. We believe that the Lord has died and resurrected. We also believe that those who do not believe and who are not saved will perish. The Lord says that worms do not die and fire is not quenched in Hades. An unbeliever will suffer eternal punishment. How else can we explain worms that do not die and fire that cannot be quenched? Revelation 20 says that the final judgment is eternal. Many will be thrown into the lake of fire. Fire will come down from heaven and burn the inhabitants of Gog and Magog. They will suffer day and night in the lake of fire forever.</p><p>Revelation 20:14 says, "And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire." The lake of fire is the second death. We should consider how long this lake of fire will last. Since the New Jerusalem will last for eternity, the lake of fire must also last for eternity. The Judaizers say that eternity is determined by the ages. But in the original language, eternity means the ages of the ages; it does not specify which age, but the ages of the ages, that is, eternal. Eternal life and eternal death are both unto the ages of the ages. God is unto the ages of the ages. The Judaizers argue that the word eternity means different things when used in different places. For example, they say that when applied to a grasshopper it means one thing; their eternity is only for three months. Human perdition is also eternal only in the sense of a period of time. But how do we know that the eternity of a sinner is relative, like that of a grasshopper? If a sinner's suffering is not eternal and his judgment is not eternal, the Lord would not have needed to die. There is the need for salvation because suffering and judgment are eternal. The arguments of the Judaizers are a kind of deception.</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING THE JUDAIZERS</h2><p>In summary there are three basic errors with the Judaizers. The first concerns the law, the second concerns the Lord's redemption, and the third concerns man's salvation after death. There are a few problems associated with them: First, according to their 1887 statistics, they had 260,000 converts. By now they must have over a million. But their teaching says that the Bible only grants 144,000 to be the overcomers. Only these ones will be able to go to heaven. If this is the case, they cannot preach their gospel anymore because the more they preach the more their elect will be displaced. Second, they consider all those who make Sunday the Sabbath to be sealed by the beast. Third, they even say that the tribulation will not be seven years. Rather it will be seven plagues within a year. How absurd this is! Fourth, some of them even claim that they are the third angel who blows the trumpet in Revelation. Now we can see the confusion of the Judaizers' system. They take advantage of the deadness of Protestantism to gain power for themselves. On the one hand, they have the Ten Commandments on their chapel walls. On the other hand, they will not read the Bible. If they are willing to read the Bible, they will not understand the verses we present to them. They are trained in their own way. They will bring out many unrelated passages to argue with us. When we talk with them, we have to be clear. We must not be led away by them. It is better for new ones not to contact them at all. If we reject them, they will not come back again.</p><p>They act in the same principle as the Jews in Revelation 2 and 3. The Seventh-day Adventists can be considered Judaizers. It is very difficult to bring a Seventh-day Adventist to salvation. The more a person is of the devil, the harder it is for him to turn to the Lord. We get an uneasy feeling whenever we are around a Hindu. Men like Gandhi may love to talk about the truth of love, but this cannot cause them to be saved because their love is not the love of Christ. When we listen to them, something bothers us within. The same is true, if not more so, when we talk with the Judaizers. Their teachings are too far off from the truth. We have to protect the brothers and sisters from falling into this darkness. Their teachings are too dangerous. We should only speak such things to the new ones briefly. There is no need to enumerate the names of all the heretics and evil teachers. We know the seriousness of the danger, but the new ones do not know. We have to help them not to contact these teachings so that they will be spared from such troubles.</p><p>A hundred years ago when the Brethren were raised up, they refuted the teaching of the Judaizers in the course of shaking up the Protestants. The Brethren are very good at Bible exposition. They are also very knowledgeable about the Lord's second coming. The proper attitude towards the Judaizers is to touch them as little as possible. Protestantism has disregarded one thing in the Bible&mdash;the Lord's second coming, and the Judaizers seize this point and use it to confuse the church. Among the Brethren, there are sixteen different interpretations concerning Daniel 9 in regards to the Lord's coming. All of them are trustworthy interpretations. The Judaizers are simply talking nonsense when it comes to interpreting Daniel and Revelation. These two books are not that hard. If any brother is distracted by the Judaizers, we have to bear the responsibility. Their propaganda rests heavily on the fact that Protestants do not read their Bible and that they have something to say about the Lord's second coming. We have to help new ones know the errors of the Judaizers so that they will guard themselves against the wrong teachings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE TEACHINGS OF JEZEBEL</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>In the epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation, there is a self-proclaimed prophetess called Jezebel. She teaches God's servants and leads them astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices. Who is this Jezebel? She was the wife of Ahab, a king of Israel in the Old Testament. Ahab married a woman from the Gentile land of Sidon. She seduced the people of God to worship Baal (1 Kings 16:30-32). Baal is a Gentile god, not the God of Israel. Jezebel not only taught the people about idolatry but turned Baal into their god and told the people to worship him (v. 31). Ahab was joined to the world through the help of Jezebel. The present-day Jezebel is the Roman Catholic Church. Catholicism is the self-proclaimed prophetess Jezebel. It has joined itself to the world and has filled itself with idolatry and heresies. Everywhere we go, we can see the heretical teaching of the Catholic Church and its alliance with the world. The teaching of the Scriptures is clear about this. In the parable of the leaven in Matthew 13:33, the Lord said that the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal. The three measures of meal refer to the genuine word of God, the woman signifies the Catholic Church, and the leaven signifies heretical teachings. When leaven is added to the word of God, its nature changes and becomes corrupt. The Lord did not say that the meal has been cooked with the fire; rather, it says that the meal has been mixed with leaven, and the whole lump is leavened. This is what happened to the Roman Catholic Church. Heretical teachings are mixed in with God's word, and the word is leavened.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING BAPTISM</h2><p>Let us consider various heretical teachings in the Catholic Church. First, there is baptism. Article five of the decree of the Council of Trent (fifth session) says, "Through baptism, a man's original sin is forgiven." Based on this teaching, a man becomes sinless, clean, guileless, and loved by God through baptism. He becomes an heir of God together with Christ, and no one can deny him. The Church believes that as soon as a man is baptized, he is regenerated. But this is not what the Bible teaches. Ananias said to Paul, "And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name" (Acts 22:16). He was baptized only after he had believed in the Lord and was saved. This is contrary to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. The Church says that even a baby can be baptized and thus be saved. The Council of Trent's catechism says, "All babies, whether born of Christian or non-Christian parents, will suffer eternal pain and perdition, unless they are regenerated and consecrated to God through the grace of baptism." The Church teaches that a man can wash away his sins and receive the Lord through baptism, but the Bible says that a man receives baptism only after he has received the Lord. This is totally different from the Catholic teaching.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING JUSTIFICATION</h2><p>Second, concerning justification, the Catholic Church emphasizes human work. It says that works justify a man. Its priests exhort men to do good works. Of course, this teaching is not written down in black and white. The theology expounded at the Council of Trent represents that held by the Catholic Church as a whole. It says that anyone who says that good work does not guarantee the enhancement of the grace of justification or who says that good work is the mere fruit or evidence of justification must be anathematized. If the justification that the Lord has granted us has to be enhanced through our labor, this justification from the Lord is no longer complete. We know that the gift from God is complete and eternal justification. There is no need to add anything to it, and man cannot add anything to it. When some told the Galatians to enhance their fruit by good work, Paul pronounced that such teachers should be accursed (Gal. 1:8-9). The Bible does not have a teaching of justification by work. In addition to many heresies found in its theology, the Catholic Church contains many heresies touching the matter of justification by work. It believes that a man can be absolved of his sins through prayer, fasting, almsgiving, self-mortification, and purgatory. It does not understand the salvation of Christ at all. We can find positive and explicit verses on justification in the Bible such as Romans 3:22 and 28 and Galatians 3:8 and 11.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FORGIVENESS OF SINS</h2><p>Third, the Roman Catholic Church believes in the absolute power of the priest to forgive sins. It bases its teaching on John 20:23: "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." It believes that the power of forgiveness of sins was first committed to the twelve apostles. The fact is that only ten apostles were present when the Lord spoke these words. The Lord's appearing in John 20:22-23 and His appearing in Luke 24 are the same incident. Luke 24:13 says, "And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia away from Jerusalem." Verse 33 then says that these ones went to the others and those who were assembled together with them. While they were relating these things, the Lord appeared to them and said, "Peace to you." The Gospel of John goes on to say that the Lord breathed upon them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit." Then He said, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained" (20:23). Here the Lord gave the disciples authority to forgive men, but He gave them the authority not to carry it out in themselves, but in the Holy Spirit. The Roman Catholic Church however, assigns the priests to carry out this work. When the priests say that a certain person is forgiven of his sins, his sins are supposed to have been forgiven. The church pays no attention to whether or not the priests are in fact in the Holy Spirit. The main point of the Lord's word is that those who execute forgiveness must be in the Holy Spirit. They must have the power of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of life within them before they have the authority to forgive sins. This forgiveness is a kind of indirect forgiveness; it can only be carried out in the authority of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The Gospel of John says that the Lord forgives whom we forgive and retains the sins of those whom we retain. But in the Acts of the Apostles, we do not see such power of forgiveness executed. Had the Lord entrusted such authority to the church, every apostle would have had the power to forgive. The Lord's word shows us that the church is merely a vessel, through which the Lord forgives men. When a man genuinely repents and confesses his sins, we baptize him and declare that his sins are forgiven in the name of the Lord. This is a declaration of a fact. When a man confesses his sins, the Lord forgives his sins. This is a fact. But the one who is forgiven may not know that he is forgiven because he has been a heathen all his life. Therefore, we have to declare the fact of his forgiveness to him. No man can forgive another man's sins. No one on earth has the authority to forgive sins except the Lord. No one on this earth can forgive another person's sins.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING INDULGENCES</h2><p>In the sixteenth century the Catholic Church wanted to build the great St. Peter's Cathedral, but it did not have enough money. Pope Leo X introduced the selling of indulgences. He declared that when a man bought an indulgence, he would be spared from punishment, even though he might have been sinful. For example, twelve indulgences would absolve the sin of murder or four indulgences would absolve the sin of fornication. Martin Luther was one of the fiercest attackers of the Catholic indulgence system. He pointed out strongly that it is heresy to try to avert punishment with indulgences.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MASS</h2><h2 class="head2">A Perverted Teaching</h2><p>The mass is the centerpiece of all Catholic heresies. This is the most serious heresy of all. No lover of the Lord can tolerate this heresy. The Catholic mass is equivalent to the breaking of bread. The Bible shows us by clear example that we have the bread and the cup in breaking the bread. In the Catholic mass, the element received by common believers contains only the bread, not the cup. The Catholics insist that during the mass, the bread is no longer bread but is changed into the flesh of Christ. Roman Catholics say that every time they conduct the mass, they offer a fresh sacrifice of Calvary for our redemption. Pope Pius IV proclaimed in his decretal: "I confess that in the mass, a real, proper, and propitiating sacrifice is offered to God for the living and the dead. I acknowledge that in the most holy sacrament of the holy communion, our Lord Jesus Christ's real, true, and physical body and blood are present, together with His soul and His divinity. The bread is fully and actually transformed into His body, and the wine is fully and actually transformed into His blood." The Catholic Church calls this the doctrine of transubstantiation. It also says that as long as one accepts one of the two elements&mdash;the bread or the wine&mdash;he has received the complete undiluted Christ. What a heresy!</p><p>The thirteenth session of the Council of Trent anathematized anyone who considers the bread of the communion a mere symbol. Even if one considers only a small part of the elements as mere bread and wine, he is anathematized. The Roman Catholic Church says that even though the mouth partakes of a little piece, it is the complete whole because it embodies the complete whole. That little piece is the body and blood of Christ. It says that these sanctified elements are to be revered and should be regarded as the very holy Son of God, and they should be praised. The Catholic Church believes that the bread is the very incarnation of His flesh.</p><h2 class="head2">The Sacrament</h2><p>Concerning the sacrament, the same council quoted Philippians 2 which says that the Lord Jesus was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross (v. 8). The Catholic Church declares that in the holy mass, the Lord's obedience is so extraordinary that He becomes not only obedient to the Father but to men as well. He is willing to come down from heaven and to remain on the altar in obedience to man. It says that in the sacrament, the Lord lies still and allows men to carry Him to the righteous as well as to the sinners. He was obedient to His parents on the earth. Now He is obedient to men, and His obedience will last for eternity. The Catholic Church goes on to say that the most wonderful thing about this obedience is His willingness to obey the creature, that is, the priests. What an insult this is to God's glory! How deep and great is this indescribable offense! The basis of its teaching about the mass is John 6:55, in which the Lord said that His flesh is true food and His blood is true drink.  Actually, when the Lord said that His flesh is food, He was referring to receiving His life, not to the bread in His supper. The Catholic Church says that whoever partakes of the bread is saved and that whoever does not partake of the bread is damned. This is a great confusion of the gospel. When the Lord spoke such a word in John 6, He was still alive on the earth. He had not died yet, and His words could not have referred to the bread of His supper.</p><p>On the night the Lord instituted His supper, He said, "Take, eat; this is My body." The Roman Catholic Church makes the bread the physical body of the Lord. But the Lord also says that He is the door (John 10:7). According to the Catholic interpretation, this must mean a real wooden door. The Lord also says that He is the vine. According to the Catholic Church's interpretation, this would mean that He is a physical vine. But we cannot become a physical branch even if the Lord becomes a physical vine. This twists the Scripture; it has gone beyond the boundary of proper biblical interpretation. There is no such thing as transubstantiation in the Bible. I hope that we will all see through such a serious heresy as transubstantiation in the mass.</p><h2 class="head2">Holding Back the Cup</h2><p>Let us consider the reason the Catholic Church holds back the cup when it administers the mass to ordinary believers. In the catechism of the above mentioned council, several reasons are given for holding back the cup: 1) to avoid the embarrassment of spilling "the Lord's blood," 2) to enable anyone to receive such life, even if he is sick, 3) to accommodate those who cannot take wine, 4) because wine is harmful to the human body, and 5) because wine is not available in some places.</p><h2 class="head2">Sacrifice</h2><p>We have to understand that transubstantiation is not the greatest heresy; the greatest heresy is the teaching concerning sacrifice. In one decree of the above mentioned council, it says that the body and blood of Christ are daily presented on the altar by the priests, together with His soul and His divinity. It says that there is no substantive difference between the holy sacrifice offered at mass and the sacrifice offered on Calvary. It considers the worship conducted by the Church during the mass the same as the sacrifice Christ offered to the Father. The reason it considers the mass to be a sacrifice is because the Roman Catholic Church is run by a priesthood, and this priesthood requires the offering of sacrifices. The mass is the result of its search for a valid sacrifice.</p><p>In the New Testament we are told in Hebrews that the Lord accomplished eternal redemption when He offered up Himself once. In the Old Testament the priests stood to minister. In the New Testament our Priest has sat down. By offering Himself once, He became the source of eternal salvation. Hebrews 7:26 and 27 say that Christ is a priest to Himself; He is both the priest and the sacrifice. No one can offer Him to God. Hebrews speaks of the Lord offering Himself up four times. In the Old Testament we find the altar, the laver, the table, and the lampstand in the tabernacle, but we do not find any chair. This means that the priests offered sacrifices by standing up. How could the priests sit down and rest when sin was still present outside the sanctuary? As long as there are sheep in the pit, the Sabbath cannot be maintained. Today, at the consummation of the ages, the Lord has offered Himself once and has accomplished the eternal redemption. He has sat down at the right hand of the Father; He has rested. Yet some people are saying that the redemption at Golgotha is not complete and that man must go to God with the help of the priests. From this we can see what a heresy this teaching concerning the sacrifice is. The priesthood is even a greater heresy. No one is qualified to be a priest to the Lord, and no one can be the Lord's priest. The Lord has offered Himself up once, and redemption has been accomplished. There is no more sacrifice for sin. Besides Him there is no other priest. Without Him no one can come to God. We have to tell the priests, "You lowly creatures, what makes you think that you are qualified to be the Lord's priests?"</p><p>We have to show the new ones what Hebrews 10:1, 4, and 11 say about Old Testament sacrifices. The Old Testament priests stood daily in their service to God, offering the same sacrifices. These sacrifices could never take away sin. But Hebrews 9:28 says that the Lord offered Himself once and bore the sins of many. Verse 12 says that the Lord entered once for all into the Holy of Holies through His own blood, obtaining an eternal redemption. Hebrews 7:27 says that He does not need to offer sacrifices daily, as the high priests did, because He did it once for all when He offered up Himself. Since the Lord has done it once for all, it is useless for anyone to continue to offer more sacrifices. The redemption at Calvary is completed once for all; there is no need of a second offering. We have to be clear about Hebrews 9:26. If the Lord's work was not complete, the sacrifice at Golgotha would not have been enough and there would have been the need of repeated sacrifices on Golgotha. The first sacrifice would have been insufficient, and there would have to be additional sacrifices. If this were the case, the Lord would have to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But by offering Himself up once at the consummation of the ages, He has accomplished everything.</p><p>The same decree also states that the mass is a true sacrifice. Every time the priests consecrate the mass, the Lord is once more being offered up. As the people receive the elements, the priests meditate on the Lord's death and His love. This sounds nice, but this is an offense to the Lord. The blasphemers who wrote these things wrote out of their natural sentiments; these words are worth nothing. The Catholic Church tries to make men believe that the bread they receive is transformed, that it is the Lord's flesh and body. It teaches men to worship it as they would worship the Lord. As the priests lift up the bread, they call upon the worshippers to worship it as they would worship the Lord!</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING POLITICS</h2><p>Another thing associated with the teaching of Jezebel is the Catholic Church's ties with earthly politics. Since 1913 Rome has been advancing these ties vigorously. By 1949 great developments have been made in this area. In 1913 fourteen nations had diplomatic ties with Rome. By 1949 seventy nations had diplomatic ties with Rome. We will see the power of the Roman Catholic Church greatly increase. During the above same period, the number of Protestants in China decreased by a third, while the number of Roman Catholics increased six times. The number of converts in the Catholic Church increased by a hundred thousand people. This shows us that the Roman Catholic Church will be greatly revived one day. This is prophesied in Revelation 17 and 18. We have to be watchful and to be on the alert concerning the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church. We have the prophetic word made more firm, to which we do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). We should not live as though there was no prophetic word. We cannot allow the Catholic teachings of Jezebel to defile us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">A FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE WORK</h1><p>I would like to fellowship some concerning our work and service.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK IN KWANGTUNG AND KWANGSI</h2><p>Canton is the center of Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces. A great need exists there, but there are not enough workers in Canton. Moreover, it is easy for Canton to be affected by the "customs of the nations." The general atmosphere of the south is more relaxed and loose. Subconsciously, this looseness creeps into the church. Therefore, the workers who are in south China have to be strict and firm in their character; they have to bring in an atmosphere of strictness and firmness.</p><h2 class="head1">SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY</h2><p>In working for the Lord, we have to learn to seize opportunities, and opportunities are contained in time. The Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world" (John 9:4-5). The Lord has entrusted the gospel work in the whole of China into our hands. We are presented with an unprecedented opportunity for our work. We have to seize this opportunity. In 1919 the Soviet Union seized power, but it did not start persecuting Christians until 1929. Before that time the believers seized the opportunity to preach the gospel, and they gained many. The Soviet Union did not return to a policy of freedom of religion until around 1940. Although the Christians lost much time during these eleven years, they had a firm foundation because they had seized the opportunity during the previous eleven years. We have to do the same thing today. We should do a day's work when there is a day provided to us. We should try our best to gain as many people as possible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CENTER OF WORK</h2><p>We have seen clearly that the line of work began from Acts 1. In Acts 1 all the apostles gathered together in Jerusalem. By chapter eight the disciples had suffered great persecutions and were scattered. But the apostles remained in Jerusalem. They went out only when there was a need. After they worked, they returned to Jerusalem. Therefore, Jerusalem was a center of the work. All the apostles remained in this center, and all of them served in one accord. Today we have to follow the same principle. If we have twenty workers, there will not be a center of the work unless these twenty gather together in one place. If every apostle works separately, it would be easy for each one to dominate over his own locality.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT RECEIVING CO-WORKERS LIGHTLY</h2><p>We have to be very careful not to receive a co-worker lightly. There must be an official letter of recommendation. Some brothers have joined us from the denominations. They can give messages and may be quite eloquent, yet it is possible that they will criticize our work as soon as they step off the platform. This will destroy our work. We hope that all the co-workers will be co-laborers in one accord, and that they will all see God's way today.</p><p>It is easy to come up to Kuling Mountain, but it is not that easy to go back down. I hope that you will have genuine growth through this training, and I hope that you will no longer recognize anyone according to the flesh. After you leave the mountain, you have to raise up a group of people wherever you are and train them to serve the Lord together. You have to perfect them to do what you can do and even to do better than what you can do. In selecting people, do not consider just outward factors; you have to consider their spiritual condition. You must give them the special kind of food they need. You have to feed them and perfect them. The best place to start is with the new ones. They are not as subjective, and it is easier to perfect them. Some people are soft outwardly but hard inwardly. These ones may never have admitted their mistakes to God or to man. Such ones are useless in the hand of the Lord, even if they are very clever and gifted.</p><p>The principle of work is to do everything to perfect the brothers and to build up some leading ones. You are not going to the different places to be "resident pastors." Never fall into the Protestant practice of the pastoral system. Never grab the meetings and the services and put them into your own pocket. Every locality should produce its own people. You should perfect at least eight or ten people to serve together and to manage the church together with you. You have to perfect all the brothers and sisters so that they can all serve. Brother Witness Lee's virtue lies in his ability to perfect the saints and to usher them all into the service. In order to perfect and lead, you have to be a pattern to them. For this reason, you have to sanctify yourself. Do not be loose.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee says that the more we dig the channels, the deeper the water will flow. Water flows to the deepest places. If our digging is too shallow, water will flow elsewhere. God's blessing depends on our capacity. I hope that we will all dig deeply and dig thoroughly.</p><p>The church must not only preach the gospel but must also conduct new believers' trainings. If we do not catch up with this second phase of the work, our gospel work will come to a standstill in a year, and it will not be easy to conduct make-up lessons. It is hard to have make-up lessons with the older ones. We have to start early. We have to try our best to bring saints up to the proper standard while they have a heart for this.</p><p>The ministry should not interfere with the local churches. In fact, the ministry is for the local churches. In terms of material supply, a worker should not ask for anything from a locality. He should not covet a thread or a needle. If a local church does not receive my ministry, I can only withdraw from it. We should not try to impose our ministry on others.</p><p>Another point worth noting is that our church meetings should not be too long. Our messages should not be too long, and our prayers should not be too long. Once they are long, they lose the impact, and our spirit becomes weak. Kuling is an exception. When messages or prayers become long, our spirit becomes worn out, and it is hard for it to be released. Unless we are constrained by necessity, our messages should be only forty-five to sixty minutes long. There are many long Epistles in the Bible, but it is best if our messages on the platform are short.</p><p>The training on the mountain is only a beginning for you. It sets the basis for you to receive further training in many areas. After you leave the mountain, there are richer and deeper lessons you have to learn. The most important thing to learn is to exercise accurate judgment. It is a pity to make mistakes in your actions, but it is a greater pity to make mistakes in your judgments. In this matter, you have to learn to free yourself from individualism. Only then will you be able to pick up accurate judgments. On the one hand, you have to be enlightened within. On the other hand, you have to touch God's mind by going to Him together with the brothers. What does the Lord want you to do in coordination with the other brothers? Even though other co-workers may not be with you, this asking will save you from acting according to your own will. Brother Witness has good judgment because he has learned his lesson this way.</p></body></html>
