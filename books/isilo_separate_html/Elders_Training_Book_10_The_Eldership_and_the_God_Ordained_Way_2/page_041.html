Immediately after the oneness was accomplished in Acts chapter two, the tests began to come in chapter six. In this message I have selected fifty-one cases in the New Testament, from Acts to Revelation, in which the genuine oneness of the Body and the one accord in the churches was tested.</P><P>By considering all these tests and the way in which they were taken care of, we can see several things. First, we can see the actual situation of the churches at the time of the apostles. For many years I held the concept that the churches in the apostolic age were wonderful, but today my concept has changed. After considering the fifty-one tests of the oneness and of the one accord, I now realize that the churches in the age of the apostles were not as wonderful as I had thought. It is hard to tell whether their condition was better than ours or not.</P><P>Second, by considering this list of cases, we can learn how to face all the tests. We can learn how to solve the problems and how to take care of them. If we would ponder all these items, we will surely see the way. I believe that this is the reason that all these negative things were recorded in the New Testament. I believe the Holy Spirit's intention was to establish some examples from which we may learn.</P><P>Third, by considering all these tests of the oneness and of the one accord, we can see what things should be tolerated and what things should not be tolerated. Many things may be mistakes and may cause us trouble, yet we should not be bothered by them; they are tolerable and can be taken care of. On the other hand, by all these examples we can find a few things that the Spirit would not tolerate; they are intolerable. Concerning these things, there is the need to exercise to quarantine those who are responsible for the contagious situations.</P><P>I came into the recovery in Chefoo in 1932. The church life at that time was very good. I remained in Chefoo for a little over a year, and during that time I did not see anything as a test of the oneness. Then the Lord led me to leave my job and to enter into His work full-time. In October 1933 I went to Shanghai, and Brother Nee asked me to enter into the work there. After approximately one year, in the fall of 1934, a big turmoil arose. That was the first time that I saw a test of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord. From that year until today I have passed through turmoil after turmoil, approximately one in every six to ten years. At times I have been bothered by this, thinking that our labor did not produce a satisfactory result. Fifty years ago I wondered why such things happened. At that time Brother Nee's ministry was the highest in the entire world, but the situation was not very encouraging.</P><P>When I came out of mainland China and went to Taiwan, the work in Taiwan had a wonderful beginning. In less than six years, from 1949 to 1954, our number increased from fewer than five hundred to about fifty thousand. However, not long after that, a turmoil arose. Again I considered why this kind of thing happens. From that time I began to see that there was not one church recorded in the Bible that did not have any trouble. This comforted me very much, and I was much less bothered.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
