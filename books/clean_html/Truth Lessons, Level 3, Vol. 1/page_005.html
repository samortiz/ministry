<h2 class="head3">1. Knowledge, Good, and Evil of the Tree<br />of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />Being in Contrast to the Life of the Tree of Life</h2><p>Since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and evil, what it includes&mdash;knowledge, good, and evil&mdash;must also come out of Satan as the evil source. Satan is the adversary of God, and knowledge, good, and evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are in contrast to the life of the tree of life. All these&mdash;knowledge, good, and evil&mdash;are distractions and frustrations that prevent people from receiving and enjoying the life of the tree of life and thus cause them to be alienated from God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Life Being Dependent upon God;<br />Knowledge, Good, and Evil Being<br />Independent of God</h2><p>The life of the tree of life is dependent on God, whereas the knowledge, good, and evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are independent of God. Anything we do in dependence upon the Lord is in the principle of the tree of life. Anything we do independently of the Lord is in the principle of the tree of knowledge. Independence is a spiritual insulation that disconnects us from the life of God.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Evil Being Independent of God as the Source of Life;<br />Since Good Is Also Independent of God as Life,<br />It Is Ranked with Evil</h2><p>The Greek word for <em>evil</em> means <em>that which is evil in character.</em> This must be the evil life, nature, and character of Satan himself. This evil is independent of God as the source of life. Since good is also independent of God as life, it is ranked with evil. If men do evil, they will fall under the judgment of God. But even if men do good, since they do it independently of God, the good they do is also ranked with evil; hence, they likewise will fall under the judgment of God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Knowledge Being Independent of the Life of God;<br />Hence, It Being Ranked Also with Good and Evil</h2><p>Knowledge appears to be something good. Almost everyone likes knowledge and has a craving for knowledge. Even the majority of Christians are greedy for it. However, behind knowledge is death. Second Corinthians 3:6 says that &ldquo;the letter kills.&rdquo; The letter is knowledge. Therefore, knowledge is independent of God and is also ranked with good and evil, which are independent of God as life.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />Bringing In Death, Signifying That<br />Death Comes Out of Satan</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Death Coming from Sin</h2><p>Adam took in Satan by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Thus, through the one man, Adam, sin entered into the world (Rom. 5:12); that is, sin entered into man to dwell in man&rsquo;s body (7:17). At the same time, this sin brought in death, and death came through sin (5:12). Furthermore, the wages of sin is death (6:23a). The wages that man earns for committing sins is death, first in his spirit and then in his body.</p>
