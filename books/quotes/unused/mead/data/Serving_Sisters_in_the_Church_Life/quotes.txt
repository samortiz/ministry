[1]  Now we need to get into the details related to these four sisters and one brother.
[2]  If you read carefully, you could see that all the things related to these four sisters include all the aspects of the practical church life.
[3]  "I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea, that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints and stand by her in whatever she may have need of you; for she has been a patroness of many and of myself as well" Rom 16:1-2 .
[4]  If you sisters do love the Lord and do mean business to be for the church in the Lord's recovery, you have to consider yourselves as serving ones, as those giving nursing care, just as the nurses in a hospital.
[5]  In every local church there is the need of a group of serving sisters like this sister, a group of serving sisters taking care of the saints.
[6]  For this reason, we are burdened to have some training for the sisters so that there could be a group of serving sisters raised up for the building up of a strong church.
[7]  The second vital aspect implied in Paul's recommendation of the sister in Romans 16:1, Phoebe, is that she was a sister more than one hundred percent related to the church.
[8]  She was recommended as one serving in the church, serving for the church, and serving the church directly.
[9]  The sister in Romans 16:1, Phoebe, was a serving one, a serving nurse, a church nurse, a serving patroness, and she was one hundred percent in the church.
[10]  In every local church there is the need of a group of sisters to be so bold to take the lead for the practical church life.
[11]  If you sisters mean business to be serving ones in the church, first of all you have to learn not to talk, not to talk at all.
[12]  A sister may realize that there are four younger sisters who need someone to serve them by praying for them, without talking to them, without letting them know she is praying for them.
[13]  When you sisters see a need in the church life, you must not talk, but bear the burden to pray.
