   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR TESTIMONY TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding the negative reactions to the matter of the ground of the church, we should have some understanding and be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In spiritual warfare the enemy continually attacks the place where there has been a military deployment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past thirty years people have not opposed us for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the East the gospel preached in many places is based upon our gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most are preaching the gospel that we have preached.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither are we wrong in regard to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just as we boast of the gospel, we also boast concerning the many truths that have been revealed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not wrong in edifying the saints with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians believe that we have drawn away the seeking ones from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, we have made seeking ones out of those who formerly were not seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, we have not received any financial support from other groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we have, it has been an insignificant amount.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the past thirty years, we have been attacked fiercely, being accused and forsaken by other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All this friction is due to the fact that we stand firmly on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past thirty years, this has been the very item that the enemy has constantly sought to defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are determined to guard this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must guard it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, if the Lord is merciful to us, we need to further strengthen this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I told the brother from Hong Kong that when I began to serve the Lord over thirty years ago, I had doubts concerning Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I saw in the Bible that the condition of Christianity was altogether improper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I also saw that the ground of Christianity was improper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The improper condition is an outward matter, but the improper ground is a deeper matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, it is the source of almost every problem in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The confusion and errors of Christianity are mostly due to the improper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the church has become very worldly and very much according to the human will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although this is a matter of condition, the condition is the result of an improper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The proper ground of the church is locality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the believers all kept the ground of locality, the many denominations that exist today would no longer exist or be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ground of locality requires that the believers pay the highest price, the price of being dealt with in their flesh and in their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today there are many Christian groups because people are not willing to be restricted by locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many groups have appealing names, but these are only an expression of man s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It may seem that these groups are only declaring that they love the Lord, are zealous for the Lord, preach the gospel, and are accomplishing a certain work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, their organization becomes a support and a symbol of man acting according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If everyone saw that the expression of the church should be local and that it must be restricted by the local ground, all these groups would no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, people would no longer only consider what satisfies their own desire but would act and walk in a proper way for the keeping of the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I said this to the brother to show him that regardless of how proper his motive or how good his college work might be, he should not establish a students fellowship apart from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If his intention is to establish a students fellowship, he is intentionally seeking a kind of self-expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To do so would indicate that he has not seen the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he saw the ground of the church, he would not dare to establish a students fellowship apart from such a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A believer who has truly seen the ground and is willing to be restricted by this ground would never dare to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan s goal today is to annul the ground of locality in order to give people absolute freedom of action as a pretext to establish denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only thing that can nullify this is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we speak concerning the ground of locality, no one has an excuse for doing whatever he desires.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ground of locality is a great restriction to our flesh, our private intentions, and our natural man.</S>
