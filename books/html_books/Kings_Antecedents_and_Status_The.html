It has two sections. In the first section, the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the second section, the New Testament, He spoke in the Son (in the Person of the Son, Heb. 1:1-2). This section is composed of the four Gospels, the book of Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation. While He was in the flesh, the Son began to speak in the four Gospels. After His resurrection, He continued to speak as the Spirit through the Apostles (see John 16:12-14). Thus, the New Testament is just the Son's speaking to us, His ministering Himself as life and everything that we may become His Body, His expression, the church.</P><P>The Bible is a book of life. This life is nothing less than the living Person of Christ. In the Old Testament Christ is portrayed as the coming One. In the New Testament, the One whose coming was predicted has come. Thus, the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old. St. Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old, and the Old Testament is expressed in the New. These two testaments are actually one, revealing one Person who is our life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OPENING WORD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>Nearly all Christians are bothered by the first page of the New Testament. It has many names that are difficult to pronounce. But this page is the first part of the New Testament. In any kind of writing, both the opening word and the closing word are important. When many Christians come to the New Testament, they skip over the first part of chapter one of Matthew and start reading at verse 18. It seems that in their New Testament there is no such paragraph as Matthew 1:1-17. But thank God for this rich portion of the Word! This genealogy of Christ is an abstract of the whole Old Testament. It includes everything except the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis. If we would know the meaning of this genealogy, we need to know the entire Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LIVING PICTURE OF CHRIST</H2><P>We need to say a word concerning the New Testament. The New Testament is simply a living picture of a Person. This Person is too wonderful. He is both God and man. He is the mingling of God with man, for in Him the divine nature and the human nature are mingled together. He is the King, and He is a bondslave. He is wonderful!</P><P>No human being has ever spoken words like He spoke, words so profound, yet so clear. For example, Jesus said, "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35), and, "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12). Plato and Confucius were two great philosophers, and people appreciated the things they said, but neither of them could say, "I am the light of the world." No one else could say, "I am the life," or, "I am the way," or, "I am the reality" (John 14:6). These are simple words and short sentences&#151;"I am," "I am what I am," and "I am that I am"&#151;but they are great and profound. Can any of us say that we are the light of the world or that we are the life? If we did, we would surely be sent to a mental hospital. But Jesus could say these things. How great He is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR BIOGRAPHIES OF ONE PERSON</H2><P>Jesus is all-inclusive. With Him there are many aspects. No one can exhaust in language who and what He is. Who else in history has four unique biographies written of him? Although the New Testament is a short book, it begins with four biographies of one Person, four books telling us of the life of Christ.</P><P>Each of us has four sides: the front and the back, the right and the left. If you look at me from the front, you can see seven holes on my face. But if I turn my back to you, all the holes disappear. On my right side you can see a little hole, and on my left side, another little hole. If you would make an accurate copy of my image, you need to take a picture of every side. This is exactly what has been done in the New Testament.</P><P>Why do we have four Gospels? Because Christ has at least four main aspects. Christ is great! Because He is all-inclusive and unsearchably rich, He needs several biographies. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present different aspects of Christ because each writer was a different kind of person. Matthew, for instance, was a tax collector. Among the Jewish people in ancient times, a tax collector was a despised person. Nevertheless, Matthew wrote the first biography of Christ. Mark was an ordinary man, and Luke was a physician and a Gentile. At first, John was a common fisherman, but eventually he became the very aged, experienced apostle. Each wrote a different biography about the same Christ. This living Person needs many biographies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXPANSION OF CHRIST</H2><P>The book of Acts is the expansion of this wonderful Person. It is the branching out of the all-inclusive Christ. This Christ has expanded from one Person to thousands and thousands of persons. He was once the individual Christ, but in Acts He has become a corporate Christ. Following the Acts, we have all the Epistles, which give a full definition of this wonderful, universal, great Man. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body: this is the universal Man, Christ and the church. Finally, we have the book of Revelation as the consummation of the New Testament. This book gives us a full picture of the Body-Christ, the individual Christ incorporated with all His members to become the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORDER OF THE FOUR GOSPELS</H2><P>Let us return to the four Gospels. If I were to arrange the four Gospels, I would put the Gospel of John first. When reading the Bible, many Christians start with John and then proceed to read Luke, Mark, and Matthew. The human concept is the exact opposite of the divine. The divine concept starts with Matthew and proceeds through John; the human thought starts with John and goes back to Matthew. Many of us would begin reading the New Testament with John because John is so wonderful. It is a book of life. After John, we would read Luke because Luke is a book of the Savior, telling us of many cases of salvation. Then, of course, we would come to Mark because Mark is short and simple. People read Matthew last because Matthew is too difficult, too mysterious. Not only is chapter one difficult to understand; the parables in chapter thirteen and the prophecies in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five are also difficult. Chapters five, six, and seven, the Sermon on the Mount, are especially difficult. No one can practice it! You strike me on the right cheek, and I turn to you the left. You force me to walk one mile, and I walk two miles. You take my outer garment, and I give you my inner garment. This is too much! Only Jesus can do it! Thus, many place Matthew last. John is dear and precious. In John, Jesus is everything, and we do not need to do anything. Hence, we like John, but not Matthew. We may not say this in plain words, but we have such a feeling in our heart. Nevertheless, the divine order is best. God put Matthew first.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GENERAL SKETCH</H2><P>With every book of the Bible we need a general sketch. The general sketch of Matthew is:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Christ is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens (the heavenly rule) by saving His people from sin (of rebellion) through His death and resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</H2><P>With every book of the Bible we also need to find the central thought. The central thought of Matthew is:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Christ, as Jesus (Jehovah the Savior) and Emmanuel (God with us), is the King, the Baptizer, the light, the Teacher, the Healer, the Forgiver, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Friend, the wisdom, the rest, the greater temple, the real David, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, the greater Solomon, the Sower, the seed, the Feeder, the bread, the crumbs under the table, the Christ, the Son of the living God, the rock for the church, the Builder of the church, the Founder of the kingdom, the present Moses, the present Elijah, the Head of the corner, the Lord, the resurrected One, the One with authority, and the One ever-present to His people in resurrection.</P><P>How rich Christ is in the book of Matthew, even richer than in John. As Jesus and Emmanuel He is another thirty-three items to us. We must enjoy Him and partake of Him. We need to experience Him in all these aspects in resurrection, not in the natural state. He is the ever-present One. Matthew begins with "God with us" and ends with "Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age." How wonderful this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS AND STATUS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. His Genealogy</H2><P>Among the four Gospels only two, Matthew and Luke, have genealogies. Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne. Such a person surely needs a genealogy telling of His origin and descent. Luke presents Jesus as a proper, normal man. To show Jesus as a proper man also requires a genealogy. In Mark, Jesus is pictured as a bondslave, as one sold into slavery. A bondslave has no need of a genealogy; hence, Mark does not include one. John tells us that Jesus is God. "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God." With Him there was no beginning, no descent. He is eternal, with no beginning of life nor end of life (Heb. 7:3). In the beginning was God! For John to talk about His genealogy would be ridiculous.</P><P>With anybody else, no matter who he is or how many biographies people write about him, the genealogy will be exactly the same. But Jesus has two genealogies. Later on we shall see how these genealogies eventually become one. Once again we see that He is wonderful. In every aspect, He is too wonderful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Generation of Christ</H2><P>Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. We need to realize who Jesus is. Who is Jesus? We may answer by saying that He is the Son of God, but this genealogy does not have such a term. Rather, it calls Him the son of David and the son of Abraham. Because Jesus is so wonderful, it is difficult to say who He is.</P><P>Jesus is the mingling of God with man, the mingling of divinity with humanity. This is the generation of Jesus. The generation of Jesus means that He is the mingling, the wonderful mingling. In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings, with all kinds of people. We should no longer think that Matthew 1:1-17 is just a list of names.</P><P>The generation of Christ is composed of:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Fathers</H2><P>These are the forefathers, the great persons. All together they make up fourteen generations (1:2-6a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Kings</H2><P>These are the kings, the royalty, who also make up fourteen generations (1:6b-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Civilians<br>(the Captured Ones and the Recovered Ones)</H2><P>The generation of Christ not only includes the high-ranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph. The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ. Christ was ranked not only with the patriarchs and with the kings, but also with a group of civilians. He was not only of the great ones, of the royal ones, but also of the little ones. From this picture of the generation of Christ, we can see that it includes all kinds of people.</P><P>This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity. In this brief record we have the words "carrying away" (v. 17). Abraham was called out of Babel, the origin of Babylon. The generation of Christ includes not only the called ones, but also the backsliders. Perhaps five years ago you were a called one, but today you are a backslider. Do not be disappointed. The generation of Christ includes you. This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and carried away to Babylon as a captive. Have you ever been dethroned? Do not think you have not. In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned. Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider. Our forefather Abraham came from Babylon; yet you went back, not willingly, but were carried back. Praise the Lord that the generation of Christ includes even the fallen ones!</P><P>After captivity there was the recovery. Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery. Many captives returned with Zerubbabel. The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones. If I were to ask you which kind you are, you may say that firstly you were a called one, then a fallen one, and finally a recovered one. You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel. We are all Zerubbabels. We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Four Remarried Women</H2><P>According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males. But in this brief genealogy five women are mentioned. These five women are like the fingers of my hand: four form one group and the other one stands alone. Four of these five women were remarried, and one of the four was a harlot. It seems that the divine record here would not mention the good ones, such as Sarah or Rebekah, but the bad ones. Listen to the divine record: "David begot Solomon of the wife of Uriah" (1:6). The record does not even give her name; it gives only her history in order to remind us of what kind of person she was.</P><P>Do you know the history of Tamar? She was the daughter-in-law of Judah. Judah begot twins of his daughter-in-law (Gen. 38:24-30). How terrible! The second woman named is Rahab, the harlot of Jericho, and the third, Ruth, a Moabitess. The Moabites were not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord even to their tenth generation (Deut. 23:3). The Moabites are descendants of Moab, who was born of Lot with his daughter. The fourth woman was Bathsheba, the wife of a Canaanite named Uriah whom David murdered. David took her to be his wife, and with her he begot Solomon.</P><P>Why does this brief record mention all these women? It is because they are our representatives. Do not think you are so pure, that you are more pure than these women. Trace your own origin. If you do, you will find out by what way and of whom your grandfather was born, by what way and of whom your father was born, and by what way and of whom you were born. We are worse. But the worst ones are included in the generation of Christ! Praise the Lord! He is truly the Savior of sinners.</P><P>The number four signifies all the creatures, including the entire human race. Humanity is dirty; no one is clean. But, thank the Lord, we are all associated with Christ. We are part of the generation of Christ.</P><P>If we were to write a biography of Christ and there were no biographies of Him in the Bible, we would not dare to write it this way. We would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah. But the Holy Spirit did not mention Sarah, Rebekah, and all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones. If this divine record had listed the names of the good women without the names of the impure ones, I would be in doubt about the present situation of the church. I would say, "Look at today's situation in the church. Not many are very pure." Do not think that you are so pure, so clean. We are not pure. Nevertheless, the generation of Christ includes both good ones and bad ones. In fact, it includes more bad ones than good ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The One Virgin</H2><P>Besides the four remarried women, a virgin stands out: Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary was good, pure, and clean. This indicates that everyone mentioned in this book of generation is a sinner except Jesus. With the exception of Jesus, all are unclean.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Son of David</H2><P>Christ is the son of David (Matt. 22:42, 45; Rev. 22:16). Solomon, the son of David, was a type of Christ in three main aspects. First, he was a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom (2 Sam. 7:12b, 13; Jer. 23:5; Luke 1:32-33). Second, Solomon had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In Matthew 12 we see that Christ also had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In this chapter Christ referred to Himself as the greater Solomon (v. 42). A greater than Solomon was there, and He spoke words of wisdom. No human words are as wise as the words of Christ. Third, Solomon built the temple of God (2 Sam. 7:13). As the son of David, Christ builds up God's temple, the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Son of Abraham</H2><P>Christ is also the son of Abraham. This book of generation says only that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham, not the son of anyone else. In the Old Testament there was a clear prophecy that Christ would be the son of Abraham. Isaac was a type of Christ. With Isaac as a type of Christ there were also three main aspects. First, Isaac brought the blessing to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles (Gen. 22:18a; Gal. 3:16, 14). Second, he was offered to God unto death and was resurrected (Gen. 22:1-12; Heb. 11:17, 19). Third, he received the bride (Gen. 24:67). This is a type of Christ as the promised One who brought the blessing to all nations, who was also offered to death, who was resurrected, and who, after His resurrection, will receive His Bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7). One day the Holy Spirit, typified by Abraham's servant, will bring the spiritual, divine, heavenly Rebekah to her heavenly Isaac.</P><P>The son of Abraham received the bride, and the son of David built up the temple. With Christ, the Bride is the temple, and the temple is the Bride. This is why it says that Christ is the son of Abraham and the son of David. He offered Himself unto death and was resurrected, now He is building God's temple, and in the future He will receive the Bride. Christ also spoke wisdom and brought God's blessing to all nations. He is the One to fulfill all of these things. In the four Gospels we can find each of these six aspects. The Gospels reveal that Christ came to inherit the kingdom, that He offered Himself unto death and He was resurrected, that He spoke the word of wisdom, that He brought blessing to all people, that He is building up God's house, and that He will come to receive the Bride. Christ is surely the real Isaac and the real Solomon.</P><P>As the son of David, Jesus was a great blessing to the Jews. But as the son of Abraham, He brings blessing to all the Gentiles. As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all. If Jesus were only the son of David, He would have nothing to do with me. Praise the Lord that He is also the son of Abraham! All nations are blessed in Abraham's seed, which is Christ. This blessing is the participation in the Triune God. The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit (Gal. 3:14), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God. By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God. Hallelujah!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS<br>AND STATUS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Abraham</H2><P>The genealogy in Matthew begins with Abraham, but the genealogy in Luke goes back to Adam. Matthew does not cover Adam and his descendants, but Luke does. What is the meaning of this difference? Luke is a book of God's salvation, whereas Matthew is a book of the kingdom. God's salvation is for the created and fallen race represented by Adam, but the kingdom of the heavens is only for God's chosen people, the called race represented by Abraham. Therefore, Matthew starts from Abraham, but Luke traces the genealogy back to Adam.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Called</H2><P>In the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through. The created race failed Him. Man fell to such an extent that all mankind rebelled against God to the uttermost, and built the tower and city of Babel to express their rebellion (Gen. 11:1-9). So God gave up the created and fallen race, and He called one, Abraham, out of that race to be the father of another race. Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham (Gen. 12:1-2; Heb. 11:8). From the time God called him out of Babel (later Babylon) into Canaan, God gave up the Adamic race and invested all His interest in this new race, with Abraham as its head. This is the called race, the transformed race. It is not a race according to nature, but a race according to faith.</P><P>God's kingdom is for this race. It could never be with the fallen race. Thus, Matthew, dealing with the kingdom of the heavens, begins with Abraham. Because the book of Luke concerns God's salvation (and surely salvation must be for the fallen race), his genealogy goes back to Adam. After being saved in Luke, we are spontaneously transferred from the fallen race to the called race. We used to be descendants of Adam; now we are descendants of Abraham. Galatians 3:7 and 29 tell us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham. Whose son are you? Are you the son of Adam or the son of Abraham? We are the real Jews (Rom. 2:29). Our grandfather is Abraham. We are in the same category he is. If we were not descendants of Abraham, then we would have no share in the book of Matthew. We would not even have a share in the short book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham. Only if we are descendants of Abraham do we have a share in Galatians. Praise the Lord that we are the sons of Abraham! "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Gal. 3:29).</P><P>Abraham was called out by God. The Greek word for church, ekklesia, means "the called out ones." Thus, we in the church are also the called out ones. Abraham was called out of Babel, the place of rebellion and idolatry, into the good land, which typifies Christ. We also were in Babel. We were fallen, we were rebellious, and we worshipped idols. Today the whole human race is in Babel. We used to be there, but one day God called us out and put us into Christ, the high land. We were called by God into "the fellowship [the participation] of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" (1 Cor. 1:9). "Unto them which are called,...Christ [is] the power of God, and the wisdom of God" (1 Cor. 1:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Justified by Faith</H2><P>Abraham, as a called one, was justified by faith (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:2-3). The fallen ones depend on their work, but the called ones believe in God's work, not in their own work. No fallen person can be justified by works in the sight of God (Rom. 3:20). Therefore, the called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God's work of grace. Abraham and all other believers are like this. "They which be of faith are blessed with the believing Abraham" (Gal. 3:9, Gk.). The blessing of God's promise, "the promise of the Spirit" (Gal. 3:14), is for the believing ones. By faith we received the Spirit, which is the reality and realization of Christ (Gal. 3:2). Thus, both Abraham and we are associated with Christ and joined to Him by faith. It is by faith in God's work of grace that God's called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Living by Faith</H2><P>Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith. Then, verse 9 says that he also lived in the good land by faith. As the called one of God, not only was Abraham justified by faith, but he also lived by faith. As one called by God, he should no longer live and walk by himself, but live and walk by faith. For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself, to forget himself, to set himself aside, and to live by Someone else. Whatever he had by nature had to be set aside.</P><P>If we compare Genesis 11:31 and 12:1 with Acts 7:2-3, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak. Abraham did not take the initiative to leave Babel; his father, Terah, did. This forced God to take away Abraham's father. In Genesis 12:1 God called him again, telling him to leave not only his country and his kindred, but also his father's house, which meant not to bring anyone with him. But once again Abraham, like us, was weak and he took Lot, his nephew (Gen. 12:5).</P><P>What is an Abraham? An Abraham is a person who has been called out, who no longer lives and walks by himself, and who forsakes and forgets everything he has by nature. This is exactly the message of the book of Galatians. Galatians 3 says that we are the sons of Abraham and that we should live by faith, not by our works. Galatians 2:20 says that to live by faith means "not I, but Christ." I, the natural I who came out of the fallen race, have been crucified and buried. Thus, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me. This is Abraham. If we are true Jews, the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything and live by faith. We must forget about all that we can do and repudiate all that we are and have by nature. This is not easy.</P><P>Christians appreciate Abraham very much. However, we should not esteem Abraham too highly. He was not that outstanding. He was called, but he did not dare to leave Babel; his father took him out. This forced God to remove his father. Then Abraham relied on his nephew, Lot. After this, he put his trust in his servant, Eliezer (Gen. 15:2-4). It seemed that God was saying, "Abraham, I don't like to see your father with you, I don't like to see your nephew with you, and I don't like to see Eliezer with you. I want you to have no one to rely upon. You must rely on Me. Don't depend upon anything else or anything you have by nature." This is believing in God, walking in Him, and living by Him. It is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.</P><P>If we are real Jews, then we are real Abrahams. In order to be an Abraham, we must believe in the Lord. To believe in the Lord is to become associated with Him. Abraham was called out of the fallen race, and he became associated with the Lord. All the sons of Abraham must likewise be associated with Christ. "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed." In other words, if we are the seed of Abraham, we belong to Christ and we are associated with Christ. If we would be associated with Christ, we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as everything. This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God. Do not try to do anything. Simply believe in Christ.</P><P>The fallen race always likes to do something, to work and to exert some effort. But God says, "Come out of that. You are the called race. Don't try, don't do, and don't work any more! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me." These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians. As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves. These are the ones who make up the generation of Christ. We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land. Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ. If so, then, as heirs of God's promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God's blessing.</P><P>At a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering (Gen. 22:1-2). The Lord had given Isaac to Abraham; now Abraham had to give Isaac back to the Lord. The Lord had already charged him to cast out Ishmael (Gen. 21:10, 12); now He charged him to kill his son Isaac.</P><P>Are you able to do this? What a difficult lesson this is! Nevertheless, this is the way to experience Christ. Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, "Consecrate that experience. That was a real experience of Christ, but don't keep it." Again, the lesson is to never trust in what we have, not even in what God has given us. If God has given you something, it must be given back to Him. This is the daily walk by faith. To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God. The best gifts, given by the Lord Himself, must be given back to Him. Do not keep anything as something to rely on; rely only and always on the Lord. Abraham did this. Eventually he lived and walked in the presence of God purely by faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Isaac</H2><P>Matthew 1:2 says, "Abraham begot Isaac." What is the outstanding point here concerning Isaac? It is that Isaac was born by promise (Gal. 4:22-26, 28-31; Rom. 9:7-9). He was the only heir (Gen. 21:10, 12; 22:2a, 12b, 16-18), and he inherited the promise of Christ (Gen. 26:3-4).</P><P>God had promised Abraham a son. Sarah, wanting to help God fulfill his promise, made a proposal to Abraham. Sarah seemed to say, "Look, Abraham, God promised to give you a seed, an heir to inherit this good land. But look at yourself&#151;you are nearly ninety years of age! And look at me&#151;I'm too old! It is impossible for me to bring forth a child. We must do something to help God fulfill His purpose. I have a maid named Hagar. She is quite good. Surely you could have a son by her" (Gen. 16:1-2). This is the natural concept, and it is quite tempting. Many times our natural concept has some proposal to get us out of the spirit. Often our natural concept says, "Here is a good source. Do it this way." But such a proposal will surely keep us from God's promise!</P><P>Abraham took Sarah's proposal (Gen. 16:2-4), and the result was Ishmael (Gen. 16:15). This terrible Ishmael is still here today! Acting on Sarah's proposal did not help God; rather, it frustrated Abraham from fulfilling God's purpose. This is not a small matter.</P><P>The lesson we derive from this is that, as the called race, whatever we do on our own results in an Ishmael. Whatever we do on our own in the church life, even in the preaching of the gospel, will only produce an Ishmael. Do not produce Ishmaels! Terminate yourself! Did you not cross over that great river, the Euphrates? When you were called out of Babel, you crossed that great river and you were buried there. You were terminated there. Do not live by yourself or do anything by yourself. Instead, you should say, "Lord, I am nothing. Without You, I can do nothing. Lord, if You don't do anything, then I won't do anything. If You rest, I rest. Lord, I put my trust in You." This is easy to say, but difficult to practice in our daily life.</P><P>Remember what an Abraham is: an Abraham is a called one who does nothing by himself. God had to wait until Abraham and Sarah were through (Gen. 17:17; see Rom. 4:19). He waited until their natural energy had died out, until they had come to realize it was impossible for them to bring forth a child.</P><P>Abraham wanted to keep Ishmael and rely on him, but God rejected Ishmael (Gen. 17:18-19). We also like to keep our own work and rely on it, but God does not accept it. Eventually, God asked Abraham to cast out Ishmael and his mother (Gen. 21:10-12). This was difficult for Abraham to do. But he had to learn the lesson of not living by himself, the lesson of giving up his own effort and not doing anything by himself. He had a son, but he had to give him up. This is the lesson of Abraham and the lesson in the book of Galatians.</P><P>Participating in Christ requires that we never rely on our own effort nor on anything we are able to do. Just as Ishmael was a frustration to Isaac's inheriting of God's promise, so our own effort or work will always frustrate our participation in Christ. We must forsake all that we are and all that we have in order to trust God's promise. We must renounce everything of our natural life; otherwise we cannot enjoy Christ. After our natural strength has been exhausted, the promise of God comes. After Ishmael was cast out, Isaac had the full position to participate in the blessing of God's promise. The termination of our natural effort, the forsaking of what we can do or have done, is "Isaac," the inheriting of God's promised blessing, which is Christ. We have been baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27, Gk.). Having been terminated in Christ, we are now His, and we have Him as our portion. Thus, we are Abraham's seed, God's called race, and heirs according to God's promise (Gal. 3:29).</P><P>What is Isaac? Isaac is the issue of the life and walk by faith. This is Christ. Isaac was a full type of Christ inheriting all the riches of the Father. We all must experience Christ in such a way; not by our doing, striving, or endeavoring, but simply by trusting in Him. Our trust in Him will issue in Isaac. Only Isaac is the real element of the generation of Christ. Not all the children of Abraham of the flesh are the children of God; only in Isaac will God have His children (Rom. 9:7-8). Therefore, God considered Isaac as Abraham's only son (Gen. 21:10, 12; 22:2a, 12b, 16-18), the only one to inherit the promise concerning Christ (Gen. 26:3-4).</P><P>Although we are the race of Abraham today, are we walking in the way of Ishmael, or are we living in the way of Isaac? The way of Ishmael is to fulfill God's purpose by our own energy and work. The way of Isaac is to put ourselves into God, trusting Him to do everything to fulfill His purpose for us. What a great difference between these two ways! Ishmael has nothing to do with Christ. Whatever we do, whatever we try to accomplish, has nothing to do with Christ. We must have Isaac. If we would have Isaac, we must cast out Ishmael, stop our work, and place ourselves into the very working of God. If we let Him fulfill His promise for us, then we shall have Isaac.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jacob</H2><P>Matthew 1:2 also says, "Isaac begot Jacob." Isaac and Ishmael were brothers by the same father, but by different mothers. Jacob and Esau were more intimate; they were twins. Jacob means a superseder. He supersedes others, puts them under him, and climbs above them. When he and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau's heel. Jacob seemed to be saying, "Esau, don't go yet! Wait for me. Let me go first!" Jacob was a real heel-holder. The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter. Beat others down. Put them under your feet by any deceitful means. That is Jacob.</P><P>Because God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain. Jacob needed a vision. He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him to be number one. Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second. It is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated" (Mal. 1:2-3; Rom. 9:13).</P><P>Unfortunately, Jacob did not realize this. If he had, he never would have tried to do anything. Rather, he would have said to Esau, "If you want to go out first, just go out. No matter how much you try to be first, I will still be first. You can never beat me because God elected me." Jacob, however, did not know this. Even when he had grown up, he still did not realize it. Therefore, he was constantly supplanting. Wherever he went, he supplanted. He supplanted his brother (Gen. 25:29-33; 27:18-38), and he supplanted his uncle (Gen. 30:37&#151;31:1). He schemed and he stole from his uncle, Laban. Yet, all his labor was in vain. God could say, "Stupid Jacob. You don't need to do that. I will give you more than what you have gained." But Jacob kept striving. Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil. Do you see this? Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil.</P><P>What did Jacob need? He needed God's dealing. Hence, God raised up his brother, Esau, and then his uncle, Laban, to deal with him. God even raised up four wives plus twelve male helpers and a female helper. There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God's election. The more Jacob strove, the more he suffered. We may laugh at Jacob, but we are exactly the same as he. The more we try to do something, the more problems we have.</P><P>In Christ, we need, firstly, the life of Abraham. We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him. Secondly, in Christ we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing. Thirdly, we do not need Jacob, but Israel. We do not need the natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, the prince of God.</P><P>Do you realize that it is absolutely not up to you? When you hear this, you may say, "If it is not up to me, but completely up to God, then I'll stop my seeking." Good. If you can stop your seeking, I encourage you to do it. Tell the whole universe that you have heard that it is up to Him, and that you have stopped your seeking. If you can stop it, it should be stopped. But, I assure you, the more you stop, the better. The more you stop, the more He will stand up. Try it. Tell the Lord, "Lord, I stop my seeking!" The Lord would say, "That's wonderful! Your stopping opens the door for Me to do something. I will burn you. You may stop your seeking, but I will burn you!"</P><P>We all have been elected. In a sense, we are caught. What can we do? We can never get away. This is absolutely due to the Lord's mercy. We did not choose this way. I certainly did not choose it, but here I am. What can I do? What can I say? Because God has chosen us, we can never get away.</P><P>If we read Romans 9, we shall discover that it is up to Him, not us. He was and still is the source. Praise Him that His mercy has come to us! No one can reject His mercy. We may reject His doing, but we can never reject His mercy (Exo. 33:19; Rom. 9:15). What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God's eternal blessing! In one sense we are Abraham, in another sense we are Isaac, and in still another sense, we are Jacob. Later, in a fourth sense, we shall be Israel. Thus, we have Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</P><P>The genealogy of Christ is a matter of the birthright, and the birthright is mainly the association with Christ and the participation in Christ. Jacob's supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God. Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply (Gen. 25:29-34). Thus, he lost it and was not able to get it back, even when he regretted and wept for it (Gen. 27:34-38; Heb. 12:16-17). He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ. This should be a warning to us. Jacob respected and sought the birthright, and he obtained it. He inherited God's promised blessing, the blessing of Christ (Gen. 28:4, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Judah</H2><P>Matthew 1:2 also says, "Jacob begot Judah and his brothers." Jacob's first son was Reuben. Reuben should have had the first son's portion, which was the birthright. The birthright included three elements: the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Although Reuben was the first son, he lost his birthright because of his defilement (Gen. 49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1-2). Then the double portion of the land went to Joseph. This must have been due to his purity (Gen. 39:7-20). He was the son closest to his father and the one most after his father's heart (Gen. 37:2-3). Each of Joseph's two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, received a portion of the land (Joshua 16 and 17). Thus through his two sons he inherited two portions of the good land.</P><P>The priesthood portion of the birthright went to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10). Levi was very much after God's heart. In order to fulfill God's desire, Levi forgot his parents, his brothers, and his children and only took care of God's desire. Thus, he received the priesthood portion of the birthright.</P><P>The kingship, another portion of the birthright, was given to Judah (Gen. 49:10; 1 Chron. 5:2). If we read Genesis, we find the reason for this. When Joseph was suffering under the conspiracy of his brothers, Judah took care of him (Gen. 37:26). He also took care of Benjamin in time of suffering (Gen. 43:8-9; 44:14-34). Because of this, I believe, the kingship went to Judah.</P><P>Today we are the "church of the firstborn" (Heb. 12:23). Our birthright is also composed of these three elements: the double portion of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship. We are in Christ, and we can enjoy Him in double portion. We are also priests and kings of God. However, many Christians have lost their birthright. They have been saved and can never be lost, but they have lost their extra portion of Christ. If we would enjoy the extra portion of Christ, we must keep our birthright.</P><P>All Christians have been reborn as priests (Rev. 1:6). But today many have lost their priesthood. Because they have lost their praying position, it is hard for them to pray. If we would keep our priesthood, we must be like the Levites, and forget our father, our brothers, and our children and take care of God's interest. God's desire, not our families, must be first. If God's desire has first pace in our hearts, then we shall be close to Him and keep the priesthood.</P><P>All Christians are also reborn as kings (Rev. 5:10), but many have lost their kingship. When the Lord Jesus returns, the overcoming saints will be with Him to be priests of God and co-kings of Christ (Rev. 20:4-6). At the same time, they will enjoy the inheritance of this earth (Rev. 2:26).</P><P>Hebrews 12:16-17 warns us not to lose our birthright as Esau did. "For one meal" Esau "gave up his birthright." Later, he regretted that he had sold it so cheaply, but he was not able to get it back. We all need to be on the alert. We have the position to possess the birthright and we have it already, but maintaining it depends on whether or not we keep ourselves from being profane or becoming defiled. We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement. But Joseph inherited the double portion of land because of his purity; Levi obtained the priesthood because of his absolute separation unto the Lord; and Judah received the kingship because of his care for his suffering brothers. We need to keep ourselves pure for the extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ; we need to separate ourselves absolutely to the Lord with a heart caring for the Lord's desire above all things; we need to care lovingly for our suffering brothers. If we are like this, we shall surely keep our birthright. The extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship will be ours. Even today we can enjoy Christ in a double measure. We can pray, we can rule, and we can reign. Then, when the Lord Jesus returns, we shall be with Him enjoying the inheritance of this earth. We shall be priests contacting God continually and kings reigning over the people.</P><P>Because Judah gained the kingship portion of the birthright, he brought forth the kingly Christ (Gen. 49:10), Christ the Victor (Rev. 5:5; Gen. 49:8-9). "It is clearly evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah" (Heb. 7:14).</P><P>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah are all associates of Christ. If we have the life of these four generations&#151; Abraham's faith, Isaac's inheritance, Jacob's dealings, and Judah's care of love&#151;then we are the associates of Christ in His generation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. His Brethren</H2><P>When this genealogy mentions Isaac and Jacob, it does not say "and his brother"; only when it mentions Judah does it say "and his brothers." Both Isaac's brother Ishmael and Jacob's brother Esau were rejected by God. But all eleven brothers of Judah were chosen; not one of them was rejected by God. Judah and his eleven brothers became the fathers of the twelve tribes which formed the nation of Israel as God's chosen people for Christ. Hence, all Judah's brothers were related to Christ. For this reason, the genealogy of Christ also includes them.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS<br>AND STATUS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><P>Whatever is recorded in the Old Testament is related to Christ. The whole Old Testament is a record of Christ, either directly or indirectly. If we want to understand the genealogy of Christ, we must go back to the Old Testament and read it carefully. If we do this, we shall realize that the Old Testament is a record of Christ. This proves that the entire Bible is a revelation of Christ.</P><P>We have seen from the genealogy of Christ that His generation includes all kinds of people: low, high, good, bad, fathers, kings, civilians, captives, recovered ones, and even women with a poor reputation. Nevertheless, we must realize that there are some governing principles here. From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles which govern our association with Christ. The generation of Christ includes all kinds of persons, but not in a loose way. No matter what we are or where we came from, we can be included in the generation of Christ if we fulfill the principles. Although we have seen this already, we have not seen it adequately, for there are many more persons to cover.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Tamar</H2><P>The first one we shall consider is Tamar. Tamar conceived through committing incest with her father-in-law (Gen. 38:6-27). Morally speaking, this was deplorable and ethically speaking, it was awful. Nobody would justify this. Although I have been studying Genesis for many years, my heart still aches whenever I read chapter thirty-eight. In a sense, what Tamar did was not good at all. Nevertheless, she was righteous. The fault was not on her side, but on the side of her father-in-law, Judah, who admitted that she was more righteous than he (Gen. 38:26). You may say that there was no excuse for Tamar's deed and that incest always involves both sides. Although Tamar may be held responsible to a certain extent, she was righteous, and she had a heart for the birthright.</P><P>Because we come from a different background and have little understanding of the birthright and of its meaning to the people in those days, I need to say a word about it. In Tamar's time, the birthright meant a great deal (Gen. 38:6-8). As I pointed out in the last message, the birthright included a double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. The double portion of the land refers to the double enjoyment of Christ. The land is Christ, and the double portion of the land is not the ordinary, common enjoyment of Christ, but something special, something extraordinary in the enjoyment of Christ. Both the priesthood and the kingship are also related to Christ. For the generation after Abraham, the birthright was altogether a matter of inheriting Christ. In Ephesians 2:12, we are told that when we were unbelievers, we were without Christ. But by believing in the Lord Jesus, we have been brought into the birthright. We have been put into Christ, Christ has become our portion, and He will even be our double portion. Through Him, in Him, and with Him we have the priesthood and the kingship. Christ Himself is our good land, our priesthood, and our kingship.</P><P>Now we can understand why Tamar was anxious to have the birthright. She knew that if she were cut off, she would be through with God's promise. And God's promise was simply the promise of Himself to be the portion of His chosen people in Christ. Tamar was not willing to miss this blessing.</P><P>Tamar was the wife of the first son of Judah. This son should have inherited the birthright. But Tamar's husband was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and the Lord took his life (Gen. 38:7). The Lord also slew Judah's second son (Gen. 38:8-10). According to the ancient regulations, Judah should have arranged for his next son to marry Tamar in order that a son might be brought forth to inherit the birthright. Judah, however, did not fulfill his responsibility. In a sense, Judah cheated Tamar (Gen. 38:11-14). But Tamar did not give up; rather, she even used an unseemly means to obtain the birthright. Whether the means was unseemly or not, Tamar did her best to get that birthright.</P><P>To have the birthright is simply to gain Christ. In order to gain Christ, we must be ready to take a way that does not seem to be the best way. Let me tell you a story that illustrates this, but try to understand me; do not misunderstand me. In the past, some young people in China were inspired by my preaching, believed in the Lord Jesus, and desired to be baptized. However, their parents, who were Buddhists, were very much opposed to this. When they learned that their children were planning to be baptized, they gave them no opportunity to leave home. The young people prayed about this. Eventually, they told their parents that they had to be in school for a certain half-day period. That was surely a lie, for they did not go to school; they went to the church to be baptized. Although they told a lie, it was a pure lie. Their intention in telling that lie was very pleasing to God. If you want to gain Christ, you should not care for the way. Do not be religious; do not keep the rules and regulations. Gain Christ! You need to gain Christ. By any means, get the birthright.</P><P>It was through an unseemly means that Tamar acquired the birthright. But in the divine record in the Bible, the name of Tamar is not a bad name. Ruth 4:12 indicates that this name is sacred. In this verse the elders said, "And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah." The name of Tamar is sacred because she did not care for anything sinful; she cared only for the birthright. The significance of this for us today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Pharez and Zarah</H2><P>From Tamar we go on to her son, Pharez (Matt. 1:3). Tamar conceived twins (Gen. 38:27-30). At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed. He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn. However, Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn. Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first. The midwife was surprised. This is a good illustration of how to gain the birthright. Pharez inherited the birthright. Man did not choose him, but God sent him. This proves that it is not up to man's endeavoring; it is up to God's choice. The mother's story tells us one side: that we should be anxious for the birthright, trying our best to obtain it; the son's story tells us the other side: that although we may strive to obtain the birthright, it is actually a matter of God's choice, not our efforts (see Rom. 9:11).</P><P>I remember a story concerning D. L. Moody. One day a student at his Bible institute said to him, "Mr. Moody, by reading the New Testament I have learned that all the saved ones are the chosen ones, predestinated by God before the foundation of the world. Now I have a problem. If I preach the gospel and convince people to believe, I may do something wrong and persuade someone whom God has not chosen. What shall I do?" Moody replied, "My son, just go ahead to do your best. As people enter the door, they will see written on the outside, `Whosoever will may come.' But once they have entered the door, they will look back and see written on the inside, `Chosen before the foundation of the world.'" Tamar's story means, "Whosoever will may come." Tamar willed and Tamar came. But her son's story means, "Chosen before the foundation of the world." Perhaps you are today's Tamar, striving and laboring to obtain the birthright. But once you gain it, you will look back and see that you were chosen before the foundation of the world. The birthright does not depend on us; it depends on His choice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Rahab</H2><P>We proceed to Rahab (Matt. 1:5). Rahab was a harlot in Jericho (Josh. 2:1), a place cursed by God for eternity. Although she was a harlot in such a place, she became a grandmother of Christ. How could a harlot become a grandmother of Christ? In order to answer this question, we need to find the principles. The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions. She was saved because she turned to God and God's people (Josh. 6:22-23, 25; Heb. 11:31). After she turned to God and His people, she married Salmon, a leader in the army of the leading tribe of Judah and one of the men sent by Joshua to spy out Jericho. At that time, Salmon became acquainted with Rahab and, in a sense, saved her. Eventually, Rahab married him, and they brought forth a godly man named Boaz.</P><P>Now we must pay our full attention to the principles governing our association with Christ. The first principle is that, no matter what our background is, we must turn to God and to God's people. Second, we must marry the proper person, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. After we have turned to God and to God's people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person. Third, we must bring forth the proper fruit. Then we will be fully in the portion of the birthright of Christ.</P><P>It seems that many Christians today have lost their birthright. They do not have Salmon and Boaz. If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz, you must become involved with the proper believers, with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes. Then you need to bring forth the proper fruit, Boaz, who will be a forefather of David. We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord's people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others. If we become involved with the proper persons, surely we shall bring forth the proper fruit. This will keep us in the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Boaz</H2><P>If we are to know the story of Boaz, we must read the book of Ruth. It is a good story. Boaz is a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church. The book of Ruth tells us that Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her. This means that Christ, as our real Boaz, has redeemed both us and the birthright.</P><P>Boaz redeemed his kinsman's inheritance and married the man's widow (Ruth 4:1-17); hence, he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ. As a brother and a Boaz, you should take care of others' birthright of Christ, not only your own birthright. In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others' enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>Ruth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi. As we read this story, we see that Ruth and Naomi had lost the enjoyment, the birthright, but according to God's regulation there was a way to restore the birthright, to redeem it. But it had to be redeemed by someone else. The principle is the same in the church life today. If I lose the birthright, the brothers have a way to redeem it for me. Quite often, some dear ones lose their enjoyment of Christ. In a sense, they become Naomi or Ruth. If so, you need to be a Boaz, able to redeem the lost birthright and marry the redeemed one.</P><P>Suppose I am a real Ruth who has lost her husband. To lose the husband means to lose the enjoyment of the birthright. I have the birthright, but I have lost the enjoyment of the birthright. Thus, I need you, as my brother, to redeem my birthright. But you need to be somewhat richer in Christ. You need to have some riches with which to redeem my birthright. Then you pay the price to regain my birthright, and you also marry me. This means that you become involved with me. This kind of spiritual involvement will produce Obed, the grandfather of David. Boaz became one of the great forefathers of Christ. In a spiritual sense, he was the one who enjoyed the largest and richest portion of Christ. If a brother becomes a Boaz to me, he will be the one with the greatest enjoyment of Christ. Because he redeemed my birthright and became so involved with me, our involvement in the Lord will eventually bring forth the full enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>In the church life today we need to have a number of Boazes. The book of Ruth tells us that there was another kinsman who was even closer to Ruth than Boaz was. But that man was selfish; he only took care of his own birthright. He was afraid that taking care of another's might mar his own. This is exactly today's situation. Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ. Even in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ it is quite possible to be selfish. However, a Boaz will be generous and pay the price to redeem my birthright. All this indicates that we should take care of not only our own birthright, but also others' birthright. Day by day we should take care of other's enjoyment of Christ. The more we do this, the better.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Ruth</H2><P>We come now to Ruth (Matt. 1:5). We may say that Ruth was certainly a good woman, but she had a great shortage. Although she herself was not involved in incest, her origin was a matter of incest. Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab (Ruth 1:4). Moab was the son of Lot, the fruit of Lot's incestuous union with his daughter (Gen. 19:30-38). According to Deuteronomy 23:3, the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation. Thus, Ruth was an excluded one. However, not only was she accepted by the Lord, but she became a wonderful person who partook of the enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>Although, as a Moabitess, Ruth was not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord, she was seeking God and God's people (Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11-12). This reveals a most prevailing principle: no matter who we are or what our background is, as long as we have a heart which seeks after God and God's people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ. Ruth married Boaz, a godly man among God's people, and brought forth Obed, the grandfather of David the king.</P><P>Boaz's mother was Rahab, a Canaanitess, and his wife Ruth was a Moabitess. Both were Gentiles. Nevertheless, they were associated with Christ. This is a strong proof that Christ is joined not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles, even the Gentiles of a low and mean class.</P><P>You may have been born of a poor origin and have a pitiful background, but do not be bothered or frustrated by that. Forget it! Nothing can be worse than a person born of Moab. But as long as you have a heart to seek after God and God's people and as long as you become involved with the proper person, such as Boaz, you will enter into the double portion of the enjoyment of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Jesse</H2><P>We continue with Jesse (Matt. 1:5-6). Although the Bible does not have much to say about Jesse, what it does say about him is important. Isaiah chapter eleven speaks twice regarding Jesse. Isaiah 11:1 says that Christ will be the shoot ("rod" should be "shoot," Heb.) out of the stem of Jesse and a branch out of the root of Jesse. Christ came out of him. Isaiah 11:10 says that Christ is the root of Jesse, indicating that Jesse came out of Christ. Jesse is a man altogether out of Christ; he is also a person who brings forth Christ. Christ comes out of him, and he comes out of Christ. Christ was his branch, and Christ was also his root. We need light from the Lord to understand these things.</P><P>What is a Jesse? A Jesse is a person who brings forth Christ, who branches out Christ by being rooted in Christ. When you branch out Christ, do not forget that Christ is not only your branch, but also your root. Christ branches out of you, and you come out of Christ. Christ is our source, and Christ is also our issue. This means that we are one with Christ and very closely associated with Him. We are in Him, and He is in us. He issues out of us, and we are rooted in Him. This is the kind of person who enjoys the birthright of Christ.</P><P>We all must be a Boaz, a Ruth, a Jesse, and a Tamar. We need to be this person and then that person. Eventually we shall say, "Praise the Lord for everybody! Everybody's condition is the same as mine. Tamar's condition is also my condition. The good conditions and the bad conditions are all the same as mine. I am Tamar, I am Pharez, I am Rahab, I am Boaz, I am Ruth, and I am Jesse. Hallelujah!" After Jesse, eventually we are David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. David</H2><P>David was the eighth son of his father, the youngest one. This is meaningful. In the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection, a new start. The eighth day is the first day of the second week; hence, it signifies something new, something of resurrection. When Samuel came to anoint the king of God's people, Jesse presented his seven sons to him. Samuel looked at them and said, "The Lord hath not chosen these." When Samuel learned that there was an eighth one, David, he sent for him and anointed him (1 Sam. 16:10-13). This means that we who are chosen and saved are not people of the first week; we are those of the first day of the second week. We are the eighth child.</P><P>David was the last of the generations of the fathers, which were fourteen generations. David was the conclusion of the fathers' section in the genealogy of Christ.</P><P>David was also the first of the generations of the kings. In this genealogy, only of David does it say "the king," because it was through him that the kingdom with the kingship was brought in. He was the conclusion of one section and the beginning of the next section. He was the landmark of two ages. He was the ending of one and the beginning of the other because he was very much in the enjoyment of Christ. If we would have the rich enjoyment of Christ, we shall often need to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation. However, many of the dear ones can neither be the ending nor the beginning. Eventually, they are just nothing. In the church life, we need some Davids, some stronger ones to conclude certain situations and open up other situations. We need someone to close the fathers' generation and to open up the kings' generation. We must be strong; we must be the eighth son; we must be David.</P><P>David was a man after the heart of God (1 Sam. 13:14). God Himself told Saul that He would replace him, for He had found a man after His heart. In his whole life, David did nothing wrong, except one great thing: he murdered a man and took his wife. In one act David committed two great sins, murder and adultery. God Himself condemned this. The Bible says that David did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except for this one thing (1 Kings 15:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. The Wife of Uriah (Bathsheba)</H2><P>David murdered Uriah and took his wife, Bathsheba. She was the wife of a Hittite, a heathen (2 Sam. 11:3). She was remarried as a result of adultery (2 Sam. 11:26-27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Solomon</H2><P>After David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God sent purposely to condemn him (2 Sam. 12:1-12). After he was condemned, David repented. Psalm 51 is David's psalm of repentance. David repented and God forgave (2 Sam. 12:13). There was repentance and there was forgiveness. Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness. If we put all three together, the result is Solomon. First there were transgression and repentance plus forgiveness. After that, there was Solomon (2 Sam. 12:24), the one who built God's temple. Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God's forgiveness. Here we see two marriages. The first was a marriage between David and Bathsheba. The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David's transgression and repentance with God's forgiveness. God's forgiveness married David's transgression and repentance. This marriage brought forth the man named Solomon who built the temple of God. The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness.</P><P>After David received God's forgiveness and the joy of his salvation was restored, he prayed for Zion, for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, for the strengthening of his kingdom (Psa. 51:18). Eventually, as the result of God's forgiveness of his sin, God gave him a son to build the temple of God for God's presence as the center of the city of Jerusalem.</P><P>I hope the Lord will show you what human words cannot say. If you have been and still are a typically good person who has never murdered others, who has never transgressed, and who has never needed to repent, then God does not need to forgive you. If this is the case, then there will never be a Solomon, and the temple of God will never be built up. As we have seen, the building up of God's temple comes from man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness.</P><P>One day I said to the Lord, "Lord, my transgression and repentance need Your forgiveness. But, Lord, You know better than I that Your forgiveness also needs my transgression. My transgression needs Your forgiveness, and Your forgiveness needs my transgression. If I have no transgressions, then You don't have a place to spend Your forgiveness." When I said this to the Lord, it seemed that He said, "Yes. Because of your transgression and repentance, I do have an opportunity to spend My forgiveness. I am happy about this." But you should never say, "Let us do evil that good may come." You must do your best. But no matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen. Suddenly, you will murder, take over others, transgress. However, after you transgress, there will be a way for you to repent. If you repent, God will be ready to forgive you. Then you will beget a son and name him Solomon. The name Solomon means "peaceful" (2 Sam. 12:24; 1 Chron. 22:9). But Solomon also has another name, "Jedidiah" (2 Sam. 12:25), which means "beloved of the Lord." To you, Solomon means "peaceful," but to the Lord, he means "beloved of the Lord." This son will be the one who will build up the house of God, today's church.</P><P>You need to be right in the eyes of God all the time. But be assured that your being right is not good for building up the church. However, you should not say, "Let me do wrong!" I tell you, even if you try to be wrong, you will discover that you are not able to do wrong. I do not know what kind of sovereignty this is. But one day you will do something awful. All the brothers will shake their heads, unable to believe that you could have done such a thing. Nevertheless, you have done it! Then you need to read Psalm 51, make it your psalm, and go to the Lord, saying "Lord, I repent. Against Thee and only Thee have I done this evil thing. Forgive me." After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God's forgiveness. This will bring forth a Solomon, one who is peaceful to you and beloved of the Lord. This person will build up the church, God's temple. At that time you will be very useful in the building up of the church.</P><P>You may say, "What about today? What shall we do&#151;wait for that kind of person to come?" No, do not wait. Your waiting does not avail. We should just walk in the presence of the Lord and let the Lord do it. As Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns, "'Tis mercy all!" Yes, it is altogether a matter of God's mercy. Forget about your background, your situation, or what may happen in the future. You simply need to trust in the Lord's sovereign mercy. If you have a heart for Him and for His people, He will work everything out. He will give you the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</P><P>These verses in the genealogy of Christ are very difficult. They are not milk or meat; they are bones. If we spend an hour or two praying over these verses and over the points covered in this message, we shall see something more. We shall see that we need to be a person with a real seeking heart, a heart seeking God and God's people. Then we shall be today's Boaz, Ruth, Obed, Jesse, David, and eventually today's Solomon, building up the house of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS<br>AND STATUS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><P>We come now to the last part of the genealogy of Christ according to Matthew. In the previous message I said that this part of the Word is not milk or meat, but bones. All the points in this message will help us penetrate the bone and see what is inside it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. David the King Begetting Solomon</H2><P>Matthew 1:6 says, "David begot Solomon." Compare this statement with the record that says, "Nathan, which was the son of David" (Luke 3:31). Nathan also was the son of David. The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan. If we read 1 Chronicles 3:1 and 5, we see that these are two different persons. Luke's record is the genealogy of David's son Nathan, who was Mary's forefather, whereas Matthew's record is the genealogy of David's son Solomon, who was Joseph's forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife's line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband's line. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather. One family is the family of Solomon; the other is the family of Nathan. Under God's sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ. Christ may be counted as the descendant of David through both Solomon and Nathan. This is the reason He has two genealogies.</P><P>Solomon's relationship with Christ was not direct. Strictly speaking, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph's marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born (Matt. 1:16).</P><P>The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon's descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be the descendant of David (2 Sam. 7:13-14, 16; Jer. 23:5). Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ were nevertheless fulfilled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>S. Rehoboam</H2><P>We proceed to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon (Matt. 1:7). With Rehoboam, the kingdom of David was divided (1 Kings 11:9-12; 12:1-17). Of the twelve tribes, one tribe was kept for David's sake (1 Kings 11:13), that is, for Christ. Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David because Christ had to be born as the heir of David's throne. If the whole kingdom had been dissolved, nothing would have remained to allow Christ to be born as David's royal heir. Thus, God preserved one of the tribes for David. Apparently it was preserved for David; actually it was preserved for Christ.</P><P>After this division, the kingdom of David was in two parts: the northern part, called the kingdom of Israel, and the southern part, called the kingdom of Judah. The northern part was called the kingdom of Israel, a universal name, because it was made up of the ten tribes of Israel; the southern part was called the kingdom of Judah, a local name, because it was composed of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin. As far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning&#151;the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah? I would surely favor the kingdom of Israel, for that is something universal, something for the majority. I would never favor Judah, because Judah is too local, too narrow. However, although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, in the genealogy of Christ, not one name of the kings of Israel is included. They were universal, but they were excluded from the generation of Christ. They were excluded because they were not associated with Christ.</P><P>This picture, like all other items in the Old Testament, was written for our learning, and it is a type of the occurrences in the New Testament age. We see the same thing today. In principle, at the beginning the church was one. But after a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts. Some may say, "Were not those in the kingdom of Israel still the people of God?" Certainly they were. They were the people of God, but they were outside of the line of Christ. What does this mean? To be outside of the line of Christ means that, although you are God's people, you are not for Christ. You are for something other than Christ. Consider the situation today. We are all real Christians, and we are all God's people. But are we solely, purely, fully, and ultimately for Christ or are we for something else? If you are for something other than Christ, then you are outside of the line of Christ. For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>T. Joram Begetting Uzziah</H2><P>Matthew 1:8 says, "Joram begot Uzziah." Compare this record with 1 Chronicles 3:11 and 12, which say, "Joram his son, Ahaziah his son, Joash his son, Amaziah his son, Azariah" (who is Ozias or Uzziah&#151;2 Kings 15:1, 13). Matthew omitted three generations which are found in 1 Chronicles&#151;Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah.</P><P>This must have been due to the evil marriage of Joram to the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, which corrupted his descendants (2 Chron. 21:5-6; 22:1-4). Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom, and his wife Jezebel was a wicked woman who was fully related to idols. Because she was one with the Devil, she corrupted her husband. They brought forth a daughter, and Joram, one of the kings of Judah, married her. This woman taught Joram to worship idols, to be one with the idols. Thus their family was corrupted. According to Exodus 20:5, three generations of Joram's descendants were cut off from the generation of Christ. Exodus 20:5 says that anyone who forsakes God and worships idols corrupts himself and will suffer God's curse for three or four generations. Therefore, three generations of King Joram were cut off from the genealogy of Christ. Here we must learn a lesson. If we would be associated with Christ, we should never be involved with anything related to idols. God is a jealous God and He will never tolerate idolatry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>U. Josiah Begetting Jeconiah</H2><P>Matthew 1:11 says, "Josiah begot Jeconiah." Compare this record with "the sons of Josiah...the second Jehoiakim...and the sons of Jehoiakim; Jeconiah his son" (1 Chron. 3:15-16). One generation&#151;Jehoiakim&#151;was omitted from the genealogy of Christ. This must have been because he was made king by Pharaoh of Egypt and collected tax for Pharaoh (2 Kings 23:34-35). Because he was so closely related to Egypt, he was excluded from the genealogy of Christ. Egypt represents the world. From these two records we see that anyone who is related to idols or associated with the world will be excluded from the generation of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>V. The Captives to Babylon</H2><P>Those who were carried away to Babylon as captives (Matt. 1:11-12) were indirectly related to Christ through their descendant Joseph's marriage with Mary. Even these captives are included in this sacred record of Christ's genealogy because they had an indirect relationship through Mary, the mother of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>W. Jeconiah</H2><P>Jeconiah was not reckoned as a king in this genealogy because he was born during the captivity and was carried away as a captive (2 Chron. 36:9-10, Jehoiachin is Jeconiah). According to the prophecy of Jeremiah 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would inherit the throne of David. All of his descendants were cut off from David's throne. If Christ had been a direct descendant of Jeconiah, He would not have been entitled to the throne of David. Although Jeremiah 22:28-30 says that all the descendants of Jeconiah are excluded from the throne of David, the next chapter, verse 5, says that God will raise up a branch to David, a King who will reign and prosper. This Branch is Christ. This prophecy confirms that Christ will be the descendant of David, although not a direct descendant of Jeconiah, and will inherit the throne of David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>X. Jeconiah Begetting Salathiel,<br>and Salathiel Begetting Zerubbabel</H2><P>Matthew 1:12 says, "Jeconiah begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel." Compare this record with that in 1 Chronicles 3:17-19, "the sons of Jeconiah...Salathiel...and Pedaiah...and the sons of Pedaiah were Zerubbabel...," showing that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah, Salathiel's brother. Zerubbabel was not Salathiel's son, but his nephew, who became his heir. Perhaps this was a case in accordance with Deuteronomy 25:5 and 6, which say that if a man dies without a son as his heir, his brother must marry his wife in order to produce a son to be his heir. Without this case, we cannot understand why there is such a regulation in Deuteronomy 25. Even that word in Deuteronomy is related to the genealogy of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Y. Zerubbabel</H2><P>Ezra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon. This means that he was a leader in the Lord's recovery. This is a great thing. He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God's temple (Zech. 4:7-10).</P><P>Without this return from captivity, it would have been impossible for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. The Old Testament definitely predicted that Christ, as the descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:4-6; Micah 5:2). Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. No one would have been there. Now we can understand why God commanded the captives to return. God's commandment that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple but also the preparation for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.</P><P>It is exactly the same today. Some may ask, "What is the difference between remaining at Babylon and returning to Jerusalem? Isn't it the same, as long as we worship God and walk in the spirit?" It may be all right with you, but it is not all right with Christ. Christ needs some people to bring Him to Bethlehem. You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you. This requires a specific place. You must return from Babylon to Judah. When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah. At that time, Joseph and Mary were not in Babylon; they were in Judah. For Christ to come to earth, some of His captured people had to return. For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Z. Jacob Begetting Joseph</H2><P>The genealogy here says, "Jacob begot Joseph" (Matt. 1:16), but Luke 3:23 says, "Joseph, which was the son of Heli." Whose son was Joseph? Luke's record says "as to the law" (literal translation of "as was supposed" in Luke 3:23). This means that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli, but was reckoned as his son according to the law. Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary's father. This might have been a case according to Numbers 27:1-8 and 36:1-12, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, their inheritance should go to the daughters; the daughters then must marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe. If we did not have Matthew chapter one we may wonder why such a record exists. Now we see that this is not merely the record of a certain regulation; it is a matter related to Christ, because the virgin daughter who brought forth Christ was such a case. We believe that Mary's parents had no sons and that she inherited her parents' heritage and married Joseph, a man of the same tribe, the tribe of Judah. Even the regulation in Numbers 27 and 36 is related to the genealogy of Christ. Either directly or indirectly the whole Bible is a record of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>AA. Joseph the Husband of Mary,<br>of Whom Jesus Was Born</H2><P>At this point, the record of this genealogy does not say "Joseph begot Jesus," as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, "Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus" (Matt. 1:16). Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14). Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). If Christ had been born of Joseph, He would have been excluded from the throne of David. However, Mary was a virgin (Luke 1:27) and a descendant of David (Luke 1:31-32), the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ's genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.</P><P>Now we need to examine the chart (p. 53) which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. The first name is God, and the last name is Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob and on to David. After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, in God's sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ. If we spend time to consider this chart, we shall realize how wonderful is God's sovereignty.</P><P>All marriages are under God's sovereignty, especially marriages related to Christ. From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary. The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman (Gen. 3:15); the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son (Isa. 7:14); the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations (Gen. 22:18); the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham (Gen. 26:4; 28:14); the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe (Gen. 49:10); and the prophecy made to David (2 Sam. 7:12-13). Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah. Seemingly, the descendants of Jeconiah were still in the royal line. But according to God's sovereignty, Mary, the mother of Jesus, married Joseph, a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family. Apparently, Jesus was the descendant of Jeconiah; actually, He was not. He was the descendant of David. Only God can arrange such a thing. Praise Him!</P><P>If you consider your history, the history of your salvation, you will see that the principle is the same. Do not think that the marriage of Joseph and Mary was an accident. It was no accident; rather it was planned by the sovereign hand of God. Likewise, your association with Christ&#151;your salvation&#151;was not an accident; it also was planned by the divine hand. Sometimes I have thanked the Lord and said to Him, "I am so happy that You did not put me on earth in 20 B.C., but in the twentieth century. You put me on this earth in a place where the missionaries came with the Bible. One day I was born of a Christian mother. Later, I was given the opportunity to hear the gospel, and I was saved. Hallelujah!" This was no accident. Neither was your association with Christ an accident. God carefully planned it all. God has arranged all this for little people like us. This is not an insignificant matter. When we enter eternity, we may be very surprised. We may shout, "Praise the Lord!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>BB. Mary</H2><P>We come now to Mary, the virgin (Matt. 1:16). Being a virgin, she was different from the other four women mentioned in this genealogy. Mary was pure and unique. She conceived of the Holy Spirit, not of man, to bring forth Christ (Luke 1:34-35; Matt. 1:18b, 20b). This account of the four remarried women and the one virgin proves that all the persons recorded in this genealogy were born of sin, except Christ, who was born in holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>CC. The One Who Is Called Christ</H2><P>Matthew uses the phrase, "Who is called Christ" (v. 16). In Luke's genealogy, the title Christ is not mentioned. Luke mentions the name Jesus because Luke proves that the Lord came to be a man, not to be the Anointed One, the King, the Messiah. Matthew, on the contrary, proves that Jesus is the King, the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. Hence, he added the word, "Who is called Christ."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>DD. Abraham, David, and Mary</H2><P>Abraham, David, and Mary are three pleasant names in the Bible, names sweet to the ears of God (vv. 2, 6, 16). Abraham represents a life by faith, David represents a life under the dealing of the cross, and Mary represents a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. It was through these three kinds of lives that Christ was brought forth into humanity.</P><P>The principle is the same today. Consider the matter of preaching the gospel. The purpose of preaching the gospel is to bring Christ into humanity. This requires a great deal of faith, a life under the dealing of the cross, and a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. If we have these kinds of lives, we shall surely bring Christ into humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>EE. To David and from David</H2><P>David is the end of the generations of the fathers and the beginning of the generations of the kings (v. 17). He was the one person used by God as a landmark both to conclude the section of the fathers and to begin the section of the kings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>FF. Until the Carrying Away and<br>from the Carrying Away</H2><P>At the time of degradation, there was no person as a landmark to divide the generations as did Abraham and David. So, the carrying away itself became a landmark, a landmark of shame. At that time, the landmark was not a person; it was the carrying away to Babylon. The Bible is careful to show us that no person prevailed as the landmark for that generation. This was a shame.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>GG. Three Groups of Fourteen Generations</H2><P>Verse 17 mentions three groups of fourteen generations. The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies the creatures. In Revelation 4:6 we have the four living creatures, and in Revelation 7:1 we have "the four corners of the earth" and "the four winds." The number ten signifies fullness. We often speak of one tenth, meaning the tenth part of fullness (see Gen. 14:20). Therefore, in Matthew 25:1 we have ten virgins. Look at your two hands and your feet: you have ten fingers and ten toes. Thus, the number ten denotes fullness, and the number fourteen signifies the creatures in full.</P><P>Three times of fourteen generations indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full. This is very meaningful. The Persons of the Triune God are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, including the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father fits into the section of the fathers, God the Son fits into the section of the kings, and God the Spirit fits into the section of the civilians. This is wonderful! Therefore, three times fourteen means the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures. This record of the generation of Christ indicates the mingling of the Triune God with these human creatures.</P><P>The Triune God has been traveling through Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Judah, Boaz and Obed, Jesse and David, and then through many other generations to Mary and Joseph. Finally, Jesus came. Who is Jesus? Jesus is the Triune God traveling through all the generations and coming forth as the mingling of divinity with humanity.</P><P>Three times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number of trials, temptations, and sufferings (Heb. 3:9; Matt. 4:2; 1 Kings 19:8). Christ is the forty-second generation. Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trials. Numbers 33:5-48 shows us that the children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they came into Canaan. According to the record of the Old Testament, the Israelites suffered all the way through these forty-two stations. They were tried, they were tempted, and they were tested. They had no rest. However, after passing through these forty-two stations, they entered into rest. This not only happened in the past, but will happen again in the future. In Revelation 13, we see that there will be forty-two months, three and one-half years. These forty-two months will be the concluding part of the final seven years, the last week mentioned in Daniel 9:24-27. There are seventy weeks: the first seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and then the last week, each week representing seven years. The second half of these last seven years, a period of forty-two months, will be the great tribulation, and it will be awful. There will be many trials, testings, temptations, and sufferings. But, when these forty-two months have been completed, the kingdom will come and there will be rest. From Abraham through Mary was a time of sufferings, tests, and temptations. After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction. With Him we have complete rest and full satisfaction.</P><P>If we read the history in Chronicles, we shall discover that the generations from Abraham to Christ were actually forty-five generations. Why then does Matthew have only forty-two? By deducting from the forty-five generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and by making David two generations (one of the fathers and one of the kings), the generations become forty-two, which are divided into three ages of fourteen generations each.</P><P>Remember: this is not only a life-study, but also a Bible study. Hence, we need some knowledge. We need to see that the record of Matthew is not a record according to history, but a record according to doctrine. The record of John, on the contrary, is according to history, for John wrote his Gospel according to the events of history. According to history, it was forty-five generations, but according to Matthew's doctrinal purpose, it was forty-two generations. Matthew must have had a doctrinal purpose in saying that from Abraham to David was fourteen generations, from David to the carrying away was another fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Christ was still another fourteen generations. It was not inaccurate for Matthew to say this. Three generations were omitted because they were not qualified, and a fourth generation was disqualified and cut off. But there was a wonderful person, David the king, who was doubly qualified. He became two generations, closing one section and opening another. He brought in the kingship, for through him the kingdom was established. Therefore, by David's being counted as two generations, this genealogy of Christ can consist of forty-two generations in three sections, each with fourteen generations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>HH. "To the Christ"</H2><P>Let us now consider the words "to the Christ" (Matt. 1:17). Luke's record begins with Jesus and traces back to God, a total of seventy-seven generations. Matthew's record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed toward Christ and brought forth Christ. Without Christ, there are just forty-one generations; there is no goal, no consummation, and no conclusion. Forty-one is not a good number; we must have the number forty-two. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. Christ came to fulfill all the prophecies, the prophecies of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and David. Without the coming of Christ, all these prophecies would have been in vain. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From, this point on, the whole New Testament is the full expounding of this wonderful Christ. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament&#151;the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation&#151;tell us how this Christ fulfills all the prophecies, solves all our problems, and meets all our needs and how He is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS<br>AND STATUS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. HIS BIRTH</H2><P>In this message we come to the birth of Christ. Because the birth of Christ is altogether a mystery, it is difficult to talk about it. First, we need to consider some matters related to the preparation for Christ's birth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By God's Sovereignty</H2><P>The birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God's sovereignty (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:26-27). By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David. Marriage is a mystery. It is not easy to bring two persons together, especially when it concerns the birth of Christ. It was not a simple matter to bring Joseph and Mary together. Look into the history here. According to the genealogy of Christ in Matthew, Joseph was a descendant of Zerubbabel, a returned captive. Zerubbabel, a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the royal family, led the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem (Ezra 2:2). Eventually, he also took the lead in rebuilding the temple (Ezra 3:8; 5:2). Joseph was his descendant. If there had been no return of the captives, where would Joseph have been born? He would have been born in Babylon. The same would have been true for Mary, also a descendant of the returned captives. If the forefathers of Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon and if both Mary and Joseph themselves had been born there, how could Jesus have been born of Mary in Bethlehem? Now we can see God's sovereignty in bringing back the forefathers of Joseph and Mary.</P><P>By His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (Luke 1:26; 2:4). If they had lived far away from each other, it would have been difficult for them to come together in marriage. Joseph and Mary not only were descendants of the returned captives, but also lived in the same little town. This allowed them to come together in marriage.</P><P>Furthermore, when we examine the genealogies in Matthew and Luke, we discover that Joseph was a descendant of the royal line, the line of Solomon (Matt. 1:6-7), and Mary was a descendant of the common line, the line of Nathan (Luke 3:31). Although Joseph and Mary came together in marriage, Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph. Apparently, He was born of Joseph; actually, He was born of Mary (Matt. 1:16). This was absolutely a matter of God's sovereignty.</P><P>As we have seen in a previous message, the curse recorded in Jeremiah disqualified any descendant of Jeconiah from inheriting the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). If, in actuality, Jesus had been born of Joseph, He would have been disqualified from the throne of David. Because Joseph was still in the royal line, he was a royal descendant according to man's eyes. By the marriage of Mary, Jesus' mother, with Joseph, Jesus was apparently associated with this royal line. Again, we see God's sovereignty. God found a young woman, also the descendant of David, to bring forth Christ. Jesus was born of her and was actually the seed of David qualified to inherit the throne of David.</P><P>By this sovereign arrangement, Jesus was both an ordinary person and the heir of the royal throne. This is the reason He has two genealogies, one in Luke, telling us of His common status, and another in Matthew, telling us of His royal status. His common status came from Mary, and His royal status came from Joseph. Thus Jesus was born by God's sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of sovereignty. Only Jesus was qualified to enjoy such a sovereign arrangement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Through Mary's Surrender</H2><P>According to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary's surrender. Here I would say a word to the young people. It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child. If I had been she, I would have said, "Lord, if You would ask me to do anything other than this, I would do it. But You ask me to conceive a child! This is not humanly possible; it is neither moral nor ethical. I can't do it!" For us to read this record is easy. However, suppose a young sister among us were to receive such a commission tonight. Could she accept it? This is not an insignificant matter. Mary might have said, "Gabriel, don't you know that I am espoused to a man already? How can I conceive a child?" Who among us would accept such a commission? If an angel spoke such a word to you, could you accept it?</P><P>After listening to the angel, Mary said, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38). This may appear simple, but the price was extremely high. To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price&#151;the cost of her whole being. It is not easy to bring forth Christ; it is not cheap. If we would bring forth Christ, we must pay a price. Mary did.</P><P>Joseph reacted immediately, planning that he would put Mary away secretly (Matt. 1:19). Thus, Mary was in trouble. I assure you, whenever you accept the commission to bring forth Christ, you will find yourself in trouble. All the angels will understand you, but not one human being will understand. Do not expect anyone to be like the angel Gabriel. Everyone will misunderstand you. In fact, the person closest to you may misunderstand you the most. Nevertheless, in large measure, the birth of Christ was accomplished through Mary's surrender.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Of the Holy Spirit's Power</H2><P>However, Mary's surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus. The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit (vv. 18, 20; Luke 1:35). Without the Holy Spirit, Mary's surrender would have meant nothing. No matter how much we may surrender, without the power of the Holy Spirit our surrender means nothing. Do not estimate your surrender too highly. Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit's power to come into us and accomplish something.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. With Joseph's Obedience and Coordination</H2><P>Although there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph's obedience and coordination (Matt. 1:19-21, 24-25). What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce? He was planning this. However, he was the person selected by God for the birth of Christ. Therefore, he was not so rough and quick; rather, he was considerate and thoughtful. Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly. Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. At least, give the matter another night. During that night, the angel may come and speak to you. This happened to Joseph. While he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream (v. 20). Joseph obeyed the word of the angel.</P><P>Suppose you were engaged to a young girl and discovered that she was with child. Would you still take her? To take such a woman would surely be a shame. Therefore, not only Mary paid a price, but Joseph also paid a price. The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.</P><P>The points we have covered thus far in this message are merely some minor points. We come now to the major points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Fulfilling the Prophecies</H2><P>The birth of Christ was a great fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament. The first prophecy in the Old Testament is Genesis 3:15. There are no prophecies in chapters one and two of Genesis, but in chapter three, after the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man through the woman, God gave a promise. In giving this promise, God seemed to say, "Serpent, you came in through the woman. Now I shall deal with you by the seed of this woman." Thus, the promise concerning the seed of the woman was the first prophecy in the Bible.</P><P>In Matthew 1:22 and 23 this promise is fulfilled by a virgin conceiving a child. This child came to be the seed of the woman. In Galatians 4:4 Paul says that Christ was born under the law and also was born of the woman. Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent.</P><P>From Genesis we proceed to Isaiah 7:14, where there is another prophecy concerning Christ. "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son." The fulfillment of this promise brought God into man. Hallelujah, God became man!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. God Becoming Flesh</H2><P>However, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man. What the Bible says is this: "The Word was God...and the Word became flesh" (John 1:1, 14). Man is a good term, but flesh is not. If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy. But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term. In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul says, "Great is the mystery...God was manifest in the flesh." Although flesh is not a good term, the Bible says that God was manifest in the flesh.</P><P>It is not easy to understand what the Bible means by the flesh. In the Bible the flesh has at least three meanings. First, in a good sense, it means the meat of our body (John 6:55). Our body has meat and bone, blood and skin. This is physical. Second, flesh means our fallen body. God did not create fallen flesh; He created a body. When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh. Therefore, Romans 7:18 says, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells." This indicates that the fallen body, the body of sin (Rom. 6:6), is called the flesh. All human lusts come from this flesh. Hence, the New Testament has the term "the lusts of the flesh" (Eph. 2:3). Third, the flesh, especially in the New Testament, means the fallen man. Romans 3:20 says, "By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him." In this verse flesh is the fallen man.</P><P>Nevertheless John 1:14 says, "The Word [which was God] became flesh." As we have seen, flesh means the fallen man. How, then, shall we interpret John 1:14? The Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Great is the mystery that God was manifest in the flesh. The Bible says that God became flesh and that flesh is not the created man, but the fallen man. Can we say the God became a fallen man? This surely is a difficult matter.</P><P>However, there are two verses that can help us. The first verse is Romans 8:3, which says that God sent "His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin." This verse does not say "the flesh of sin"; it says "the likeness of the flesh of sin." The other verse is John 3:14: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up." The serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness was not actually a serpent with poison; it was a brass serpent made in the likeness of a real serpent (Num. 21:9). John 3:14 is the word of the Lord Jesus to Nicodemus. The Lord told him that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must He Himself be lifted up on the cross. When Jesus was on the cross, in the eyes of God He was in the form, the likeness, of a serpent. But as was the case with the brass serpent in the wilderness, there was no poison in Him because He was not born of a fallen man. He was born of a virgin.</P><P>Now we must clearly differentiate two points: Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He was born of a virgin. His source was the Holy Spirit, and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary as a means, He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking "the likeness of the flesh," "the likeness of men" (Phil. 2:7). However, He did not have the sinful nature of the fallen flesh. He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21), and He had no sin (Heb. 4:15). He had flesh, but it was the "likeness of the flesh of sin." In appearance He was made in the form of a fallen man, but in actuality there was no fallen nature within Him. His birth was exactly the same in principle. Apparently, He was the son of Joseph; actually, He was the son of Mary.</P><P>Why was the Lord Jesus viewed by God as being in the form of a serpent when He was on the cross? Because, since the day man fell (Gen. 3:1), the serpent had been in man, and he made every man a serpent. According to Matthew 3:7 and 23:33, both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus called people the "generation of vipers," that is, serpents, indicating that all fallen ones are descendants of the serpent. We all are little serpents. Do not think that you are good. Before you were saved, you were a serpent. This is the reason the Lord Jesus died on the cross to suffer God's judgment. When Jesus was on the cross, He was not only a man, but was also in the form of a serpent. In the eyes of God, for all of us serpentine people, He took on the form of a serpent and died on the cross. Perhaps you have never heard that Jesus took the form of a serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin. You have heard that Jesus is God and that He took the form of a man, but not that He also took the form of a serpent. How wonderful He is!</P><P>We are fallen flesh, and Jesus came into this flesh that He might bring God into humanity. In Him, the divine Person of God was mingled with humanity. The birth of Christ was not simply to produce a Savior, but also to bring God into man. Although humanity was fallen, God did not take on any part of this fallen nature. God took only the likeness of the fallen flesh, and through this He mingled Himself with humanity. We should not think of Jesus in the way many others think of Him. We must realize that Jesus is nothing less than God Himself mingled with fallen humanity, taking the form of humanity, but without man's sinful nature. This was the birth of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Jehovah to Be Jesus</H2><P>The wonderful One who was born in this wonderful way is Jehovah. And He is not only Jehovah&#151;He is Jehovah with something else. The name Jesus means "Jehovah the Savior" or "the salvation of Jehovah" (Matt. 1:21). This wonderful Person is the very salvation which Jehovah renders people. He Himself is salvation. Because Jehovah Himself becomes salvation, He is the Savior.</P><P>Do not think that when we call Jesus we are just calling the name of a man. Jesus is not simply a man; He is Jehovah our salvation, Jehovah our Savior. This is simple, yet profound. When you call on Jesus, the whole universe realizes that you are calling on Jehovah as your Savior, Jehovah as your salvation.</P><P>The Jews believe in Jehovah, but not in Jesus. In a sense, they have Jehovah, but they do not have salvation or the Savior. We have more than the Jews have, for we have Jehovah the Savior, Jehovah our salvation. This is why we have such a wonderful feeling when we call on Jesus. Even if you were to say that you hate Jesus, there would still be a feeling within you. If you were to say, "I hate Abraham Lincoln," there would be no feeling. If you say, "I hate Jesus," some feeling is there. Abraham Lincoln has nothing to do with you, but Jesus does. Many have said, "I hate Jesus," and later were caught by Jesus. Whoever calls on the name of Jesus will be saved. If you touch the name of Jesus, you will be touched by Him. When we preach the gospel, it is good to help people call on Jesus. As long as they call on Jesus, something will happen.</P><P>Jesus is a wonderful name because Jesus is Jehovah. In Genesis 1 we do not find the name Jehovah. We find only the name God: "In the beginning God created..." Elohim&#151;God&#151;is the term for the God of creation. The name Jehovah, which is not used until Genesis 2, is used especially when God relates to man. The name Jesus is something added to Jehovah&#151;that is, Jehovah our salvation, Jehovah our Savior.</P><P>Jesus is the real Joshua (Num. 13:16; Heb. 4:8). Joshua is the Hebrew equivalent of Jesus, and Jesus is the Greek translation of Joshua. Moses brought God's people out of Egypt, but Joshua brought them into rest. As our real Joshua, Jesus brings us into rest. Matthew 11:28 and 29 tell us that Jesus is the rest and that He brings us into Himself as rest. Hebrews 4:8, 9 and 11 also speak of Jesus as our real Joshua. The Joshua in the Old Testament text becomes Jesus in the Greek text of Hebrews. The Jesus mentioned in Hebrews 4 is our Joshua.</P><P>It is difficult to separate Jesus from Joshua because Jesus is Joshua, and Joshua is Jesus. Today, Jesus is our real Joshua who brings us into rest, the rest of the good land. He is not only our Savior saving us from sin, but also our Joshua bringing us into rest, the good land. Whenever we call on His name, He saves us from sin and brings us into rest, into the enjoyment of Himself. A line in a hymn speaks about saying the name Jesus a thousand times a day. The more you say, "Jesus," the better. We must learn to speak the name of Jesus all the time. Jesus is our salvation. Jesus is also our rest. Whoever calls on the name of the Lord Jesus shall be saved and enter into the rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. God to Be Emmanuel</H2><P>In 1:23 we have another wonderful name&#151;Emmanuel. Jesus was the name given by God, and Emmanuel was the name called by man. Emmanuel means "God with us." Jesus the Savior is God with us. Without Him we cannot meet God, for God is He, and He is God. Without Him we cannot find God, for He is God Himself incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14).</P><P>Jesus is not only God; He is God with us. The "us" refers to the saved people. We are the "us." Day by day, we have Emmanuel. In Matthew 18:20 Jesus said that whenever two or three are gathered together in His name, He will be with them. This is Emmanuel. Whenever we Christians gather together, He is in our midst. In Matthew 28:20, the last verse of this Gospel, Jesus told His disciples, "Lo, I am with you all the days, even until the completion of the age." Jesus as Emmanuel is here today. According to Matthew, Jesus came, but He never went away. He was buried in the tomb for three days, but He came in resurrection and never left. He is with us as Emmanuel.</P><P>When we call on Jesus, we have the sense that God is with us. We call on Jesus, but we have God. Sometimes, we Christians are rather stupid. We call on Jesus and we find God; yet we wonder whether or not Jesus is God. Jesus is God! He is not only God&#151;He is God with us. When we call on Jesus, we have Jehovah, we have the Savior, we have salvation, and we have God with us. We have God in the very place where we are.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Jehovah God Born in the Flesh to Be the King</H2><P>This Jesus, who is Jehovah God, was born in the flesh to be the King to inherit the throne of David (1:20; Luke 1:27, 32-33). Matthew is a book on the kingdom with Christ as the King, the Messiah. When you call on Jesus, you have Jehovah, the Savior, salvation, God, and eventually, the King. The King rules. When we call on Jesus, immediately we have One ruling over us. If you have some unseemly pictures or photos on your walls and you call on Jesus, He will be your King and say, "Get rid of that!"</P><P>Jesus, the King, intends to establish His kingdom within you and to set up the throne of David in your heart. The more you call on Jesus, the more the ruling power will be there. If you do not believe me, I ask you to try it. Call on the name of Jesus for ten minutes and see what happens. The King will rule over you and bother you. The first night He may say that your attitude toward others has never been very good, especially toward your husband or your wife and that you must be ruled. Call on His name and you will be ruled by Him.</P><P>Jesus is a wonderful Person. He is Jehovah, God, the Savior, and the King. The King has been born and is here today. Every day, morning and evening, we appreciate Christ as our Savior, as our King, and as the King of kings.</P><P>When no one can rule over you, this King of kings will be able to rule you. When no one else can control you&#151;neither your parents, your husband, your wife, or your children&#151;the King of kings will do something. Simply call on the name of Jesus. If you do, you will enjoy Jehovah, the Savior, salvation, the presence of God, and also the kingship of Jesus. Jesus the King will be born in you, and He will establish His kingdom within you. This is the very Jesus Christ we find in Matthew.</P><P>The Christ in Matthew is the Savior-King and the King-Savior who sets up the kingdom of the heavens within us and over us. Matthew 1 not only gives us the origin of this King; it also gives us the presence of this King. This King's name is Jesus. Whenever we call on His name, we have the sense that He is ruling within us by saving us. He is setting up the kingdom of the heavens within us. Hallelujah, this is our Christ!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS<br>AND STATUS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><P>Matthew 1 is a chapter of names. We have spent considerable time on the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and even on the names of Tamar and Rahab. The last two names, however, Jesus and Emmanuel, are more than wonderful. Although the last part of Matthew 1 seems to deal with the birth of Christ, it actually deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel. In this message I am burdened to give you a hint concerning how to dwell on these names.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Jesus, the Name Given by God</H2><P>Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man. The angel Gabriel told Mary that the child she would conceive was to be called Jesus (Luke 1:31). Later, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and also told him to call the child Jesus (Matt. 1:21, 25). Hence, Jesus was a God-given name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Three Elements in the Name of Jesus</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Jehovah&#151;"I Am That I Am"</H2><P>The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah. In Hebrew, the name God means the mighty One, God the Almighty; and the name Jehovah means I Am&#151;I Am That I Am (Exo. 3:14). The verb "to be" in Hebrew not only refers to the present, but also includes both the past and the future. Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am That I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever. This is the name of Jehovah. Only God is the eternal One. From eternity past to eternity future, He is the I Am. Therefore, the Lord Jesus could say of Himself, "Before Abraham came into being, I am" (John 8:58). He also said to the Jews, "Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins," and, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am" (John 8:24, 28). We must realize that Jesus is the great I Am and believe in Him as the great I Am.</P><P>Because the name of the Lord is the I Am, we may say, "Lord, You told me that Your name is I Am. Then, what are You?" His answer will be, "I am whatever you need." The Lord is whatever we need. If we need salvation, He Himself will be salvation to us. We have a signed check with the space for the amount left blank, and we may fill in whatever we need. If we need one dollar, we may insert one dollar. But if we need one million dollars, we may insert one million dollars. If we feel that we need one billion, we simply fill in this amount. The check covers whatever we need. Whatever you need, Jesus is. Do you need light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, or righteousness? Jesus Himself is light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, and righteousness. Everything we need is found in the name of Jesus. How high and how rich is this wonderful name!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Savior</H2><P>The first element included in the name of Jesus is Jehovah. The second is the Savior. Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from all negative things: from our sins, from hell, from God's judgment, and from eternal condemnation. He is the Savior. He saves us from everything God condemns and from everything we hate. If we hate our temper, He will save us from it. He saves us from the evil power of Satan, from all our besetting sins in our daily life, and from every bondage and addiction. Hallelujah, He is the Savior!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Salvation</H2><P>Jesus is not only the Savior, He Himself is also our salvation. Do not ask Him to give you salvation. Instead, you should say, "Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation." Jesus will never give you salvation. He will come to you as salvation. We believers do not realize how much we need to be saved. Every day, every hour, and even every moment we have something from which we need to be saved.</P><P>In the messages on Genesis 1 we spoke about the need to grow in life. But what does it mean to grow in life? On the positive side, to grow in life is to enter into the riches of what Christ is. On the negative side, it is to be delivered from certain things, or to forsake certain things. Although we are small men, we have accumulated many negative things. Probably you do not realize how many negative things you have accumulated. Wherever we go, we collect things. We pick up a great many negative things, and we acquire a number of habits from which we need to be saved. As you are reading this, you may not sense that you need salvation from anything. Suppose, however, you were suddenly raptured to the heavens. If you were taken to the heavens right now, you would immediately sense that you need a great deal of saving. To grow in life is simply to be saved from all unnecessary things, from all that is not needed for our living. If you have the light, the exposure of the fourth-day lights, you will say, "Lord, save me!" At such times we realize that Jesus is truly Jehovah as our Savior and our salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Name of Jesus Being above Every Name</H2><P>The name of Jesus is above every name (Phil. 2:9-10). No name is as high and as exalted as the name of Jesus. Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name. History tells us that during the past two thousand years, everyone has recognized that His name is the highest name, that it is an extraordinary name. My burden in this message is to point out to you that this exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Believe In</H2><P>Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in (John 1:12). We all must believe in the name of Jesus. This is not an insignificant matter. We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus. When we preach the gospel, we should help people not only to pray, but also to make a declaration to the whole universe that they believe in the name of Jesus. Whenever a sinner comes to believe in the Lord Jesus, he should declare, "Today I believe in the name of Jesus!" This makes a great difference.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. To Be Baptized Into</H2><P>The name of Jesus is for us to be baptized into (Acts 8:16; 19:5, "in" should be "into," Gk.). Among some Christians there is a controversy regarding the name in which they baptize people. Some argue strongly that we must baptize people only in the name of Jesus. Others insist on the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These two groups argue, debate, and fight. Actually, it is not a matter of in the name, but of into the name. We baptize people into the name of Jesus. The name needs the person, and the name is the person. Without the person, the name means nothing. To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person. Suppose a certain young man has just believed in the name of Jesus. What should we do? We should baptize him into the name of Jesus, that is, put him into Jesus. This is not a ritual nor a ceremony of accepting a religious member. It is an act of faith in which we take one who believes in the name of Jesus and put him into this name, baptizing him into the Person of Jesus. Romans 6:3 says that many of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus, and Galatians 3:27 says, "Many of you have been baptized into Christ" (Gk.). This is the reality of being baptized into the name of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. To Be Saved</H2><P>The name of Jesus is also for us to be saved. Acts 4:12 says, "There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." The name of Jesus has been given to us purposely that we may be saved. The name of Jesus is a saving name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. To Be Healed</H2><P>To the lame man whom he met at the gate of the temple Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk" (Acts 3:6). Immediately the man was healed. Then Peter said to the people, "By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...doth this man stand here before you whole" (Acts 4:10). This testifies that the name of Jesus is also a healing name. We may call on the name of Jesus for healing from any kind of sickness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. To Be Washed, Sanctified, and Justified</H2><P>The name of Jesus has been given to us so that we may be washed, sanctified, and justified (1 Cor. 6:11). As defiled persons, we were washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of Jesus and by the Spirit of God. I read 1 Corinthians 6:11 for years without seeing a crucial point: in the name and by the Spirit. The name is closely related to the Person and to the Spirit. If the name of Jesus were an empty name, how could it wash us? How could it sanctify and justify us? This would be impossible. However, this name is linked to the Spirit. The Spirit is the Person of the name and the reality of the name. Therefore the name can wash us, sanctify us, and justify us. The Spirit is one with the name. Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord. When we call on the name of a real person, that person comes. The name of Jesus is linked with the Person who washes us, sanctifies us, and justifies us. This is not merely doctrine or theory&#151;it is reality. When we believe in the name of Jesus and are put into the name of Jesus, we are placed into a living Person, that is, in the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit washes us, sanctifies us, and justifies us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. To Call Upon</H2><P>The name of Jesus is for us to call upon (Rom. 10:13; 1 Cor. 1:2). I was a Christian for at least thirty-five years before I found the secret of calling on the name of Jesus. I thought that calling on the name of Jesus was the same as praying. Eventually, from the record of the Bible, I discovered that praying is one thing and calling is another. Fifteen years ago, I did a great deal of praying, mostly on my knees. I did not know the secret of calling upon the name of Jesus, nor did I know that calling is different from praying.</P><P>Many of us have experienced praying, but with little inspiration. However, when we call on Jesus for five minutes, we are inspired. Try it! Many of us can testify that when we prayed in the old way, we sometimes prayed ourselves to sleep. But calling on the Lord never puts us to sleep. On the contrary, it stirs us up.</P><P>Acts 9:14 says that Paul, when he was Saul of Tarsus, tried to damage all the saints. He intended to go from Jerusalem to Damascus to bind all those who called on the name of Jesus. This verse does not say that he was about to bind all those who prayed to Jesus, but all those who called on Jesus. By this one verse we can see that the early Christians were those who called on Jesus. Whenever they prayed, they called. They called upon the name of Jesus, and that became a mark of recognition.</P><P>The Bible does not say that whoever prays shall be saved. It says that whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (Rom. 10:13). Suppose that I am a sinner and I believe in the Lord Jesus. You help me to pray, and I say, "Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. You are my Savior. You love me. You died on the cross for me. Thank you." Although it is good to pray this way, praying like this makes it very difficult for the Spirit to get into us. However, if you would help me to call, "O Lord Jesus," louder and louder, it would make a big difference. When you preach the gospel, do not try so hard to change people's thinking. Instead, help them to open up their being, their heart and their spirit, from deep within and to use their mouths to call upon the name of Jesus. If you help new believers to call on the name of Jesus in this way, the door will be open wide for the Spirit to enter in. There is no need to pray with vain words. After calling on the name of Jesus ten times, you will be in the heavens. Your sins will be forgiven, your burden will be lifted, and you will have life eternal. You will have everything.</P><P>Even for a believer of many years, the best way to touch the Lord Jesus, to enjoy the Lord Jesus, to share something of the Lord Jesus, is not to say very much, but to go to the Lord and call, "Jesus! Jesus! Lord Jesus!" Call on the name of Jesus and you will taste something. "The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him" (Rom. 10:12). Many times, our words are too vain. It is better just to call, "Jesus." If you call on His name, you will taste Him and enjoy Him. The name of Jesus is a wonderful name. We all need to call on Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. To Pray</H2><P>We may also pray in the name of Jesus (John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:24). This does not mean that we pray a long prayer and conclude it with the words "in the name of Jesus." That is too formal. However, I do not oppose this, for I have done this many times. Rather, I would say that in our prayer it is good to call on the name of Jesus and say, "O Jesus! Jesus! I come to pray!" In the name of Jesus, you will have a real burden to pray, and it will be very easy to have the assurance that your prayer has been heard and answered. If we call on the name of Jesus, we shall have the assurance that we shall receive what we have asked.</P><P>After the Lord Jesus told us to pray in His name, He proceeded to say that the Spirit will come to dwell in us (John 14:13-17). This indicates that the indwelling Spirit has very much to do with our prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus. In order to pray in the name of Jesus, we need the Spirit. When we are in the Spirit, we are in the reality of the name of Jesus in which we are praying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. To Be Gathered Into</H2><P>The name of Jesus is also for us to be gathered into (Matt. 18:20, "in" should be changed to "into," Gk.). Whenever we come together to meet, we should be gathered together into the name of Jesus. Although we may meet for the purpose of having the life-study, we do not gather into the life-study, but into the name of Jesus. Whenever you come to a Christian meeting, you must realize that you are being gathered once again into the name. We have been put into the name of Jesus, but we are not yet very deep into Him. Hence, we need to come back again and again to be gathered into His name. We can all testify that after every meeting we have had the sense deep within that we have entered further into the Lord. The Christian gatherings will bring us more deeply into the appreciation of the name of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. To Cast Out Demons</H2><P>The name of Jesus is also good for casting out demons (Acts 16:18). To know the power of the name of Jesus, use it to cast out demons. Demons know the power of the name of Jesus better than we do. Demons are subtle. From our experience in China, where there were many cases of demon possession, we have learned that when we cast out demons, we must tell them that this Jesus is not the ordinary, common Jesus, but that He is the designated Jesus. We must say, "Demon, I come in the very name of Jesus, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be a man, who was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, who was raised in Nazareth, who died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of this person that is possessed, who was resurrected from the dead, and who has ascended to the heavens. I come in the name of this Jesus, and I command you to leave!" Immediately, the demon will depart. However, if you say, "I cast you out in the name of Jesus," the demon will not listen. Demons know the power of the name of Jesus. When you cast out a demon, there is no need to pray that much. Simply say, "I come in the name of the designated Jesus, and you must go!" When Jesus comes, demons must flee.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>j. To Preach</H2><P>The name of Jesus is for us to preach (Acts 9:27). When we preach, we must preach in the name of Jesus. Preaching in the Lord's name must be done in the Spirit, for the Spirit is the Person of the Lord and the reality of His name. When we preach in His name, we need the Spirit to make it real.</P><P>Through all the things that can be done in the name of Jesus, we see that whatever we do and whatever we are must be in the name of Jesus. Never forget the name of Jesus. His name is a sweet name, a rich name, a powerful name, a saving name, a healing name, a comforting name, and an available name. This is the name that is exalted, honored, and respected. And it is the name feared by the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Satan's Hatred of the Name of Jesus</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Attacking This Name</H2><P>Satan hates the name of Jesus. In 1935 the church in my hometown was revived, and we were all burdened to preach the gospel. Every night we went to the streets to preach. One night, as we were preaching on a street corner, a man about thirty years of age was very bold to scoff at the name of Jesus. A brother went up to him in a very nice way and asked if they could have a little talk. When he agreed, the brother asked, "Have you ever met Jesus?" He said, "No." Then the brother asked, "Have you ever heard of Jesus?" Again, he said, "No." After that, the brother said, "Has Jesus done something bad to you?" He said, "Never." Then the brother inquired, "You have never met Jesus, and He has never done anything bad to you. Why then do you hate Him?" He replied, "Although I've never met Him and although I've never been damaged by Him, I still hate Him." Then the brother asked, "Why don't you hate me?" The man answered, "I don't hate you; I hate Jesus." "Why?" inquired the brother. "I don't know," said the man. Then the brother asked, "Sir, may I relate a fact to you?" The man consented and the brother said, "Let me tell you, you do not hate Jesus. It is someone else who hates Jesus. Why? Because you have never met Jesus. It is not you!" When the man asked the brother who it was who hated Jesus, the brother answered, "It is the Devil within you who hates Jesus." By all this we see that Satan utilizes people to attack the name of Jesus (Acts 26:9).</P><P>As a believer, you probably have had the following experience. When you are about to talk to others about Plato or Abraham Lincoln, you do not feel ashamed; but whenever you talk to people about Jesus, a strange feeling comes over you. When the Chinese speak about Confucius, they feel glorious. We should also feel glorious whenever we speak to others about Jesus, but often we do not have a glorious feeling. Instead, we have a rather strange feeling. This is devilish! In this universe and on this earth there is a devilish element that is against Jesus. You have no problem as long as you are talking about the world situation, the economy, science, and so many things; but whenever you talk about the name of Jesus, you have a strange sense. This comes from the Devil. Because Satan and all his demons hate the name of Jesus, we must proclaim it all the more. We must be bold with this name and say, "Satan, Jesus is my Lord! Satan, stay away!" We need to shout the name of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Preventing Speaking in This Name</H2><P>If you read the book of Acts, you will see that in the early days the religionists attacked the name of Jesus, forbidding the believers to preach or teach in that name (Acts 4:17-18; 5:40). The Pharisees warned Peter and John not to preach in the name of Jesus, not to do anything or say anything in His name. It was all right to preach the Bible, but not to preach in the name of Jesus. Satan hates the name of Jesus because he knows that God's salvation is in this name. The more we preach in the name of Jesus and the more we pray to Jesus, the more people will get saved. This is the reason Satan hates this name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Having to Suffer for This Name</H2><P>When the Apostles were persecuted, they rejoiced that they were worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus (Acts 5:41). Is this not wonderful? They even hazarded their lives for this name (Acts 15:26). Because Satan attacks the name of Jesus with all his evil power, we must learn to suffer for this name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Not Denying This Name</H2><P>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord Jesus praised the church in Philadelphia because they did not deny His name. We should never deny the name of Jesus. We should deny every other name, but keep the name of Jesus. We must testify that we do not belong to any person or to any sect, but that we simply belong to Jesus. The name of Jesus is the only name we own.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Emmanuel, the Name Called by People</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jesus as Emmanuel Experienced by Us</H2><P>Now we come to the second name, Emmanuel (1:23). The angels did not speak to Joseph or Mary of this name. Rather, Emmanuel is the name called by people who have had a certain amount of experience. Whenever you have some experience of Jesus, you will be able to say that He is God with you. Jesus is nothing less than God with us. This is our experience. God told us that His name is Jesus. But as we receive Him and experience Him, we say that Jesus is God with us. This is wonderful.</P><P>Often we turn to our mind and ask the question, "Is this Jesus the very God?" We may be confident that He is the Son of God, but we may not yet be assured that He is actually God Himself. When I was young, I was taught by some fundamental Christian teachers to be careful of saying directly that Jesus was God. I was taught that the Son of God was different from God Himself. Therefore, I was told not to say directly that Jesus was God. I was told that I must pray through Jesus to God. I received a teaching that suited the human concept. However, after much practice, the more I prayed, the more I realized that this Jesus was simply God with me. To argue by theory is one thing; to experience the fact is another thing. Quite often, Christians do not agree with their experience; instead, they agree with their concepts.</P><P>I believe that all Christians have this experience. Deep within, do you not have the sense that, according to your experience, Jesus is God? You do, but you dare not say this in doctrine. However, you should not consider Jesus as someone other than God. Jesus is nothing less than God Himself. He is not only the Son of God, but also God Himself. Some good writers have said that apart from Jesus we can never find God. God is with Jesus, and God is Jesus. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was not only with God, but the Word was God (John 1:1). This Word became flesh and was called Jesus.</P><P>When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us. We have heard that Jesus is our comfort, our rest, our peace, and our life. Jesus is so much to us. If we would experience Him, we would immediately say, "This is God! This is not God far away from me, or God in the heavens, but God with me." Whenever we experience Jesus in a certain way, we realize that Jesus is God with us. Jesus is our salvation. After we experience this salvation, we say, "This is God with us to be our salvation." Jesus is our patience. But when we experience Him as our patience, we say, "This patience is God with me." Jesus is the way and the truth, but when we experience Him as the way and the truth we say, "This way and this truth are just God with me." Hallelujah, Jesus is God with us! In our experience, He is Emmanuel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. With Us in Our Gatherings</H2><P>Whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us (Matt. 18:20). Once again, this is Emmanuel, God with us. The presence of Jesus in our meetings is actually God with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. With Us All the Days</H2><P>Jesus is with us all the days, even until the completion of the age (28:20, Gk.). "All the days" includes today. Do not forget about today. Many Christians think that Jesus is present all the days, except today. But Jesus is with us now, today!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. With Us in Our Spirit</H2><P>Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit." This Jesus who is with our spirit is Emmanuel, God with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. His Presence Being the Spirit</H2><P>We can never separate the Spirit from the presence of Jesus. The Spirit is simply the reality of Jesus' presence (John 14:16-20). This presence is Emmanuel, God with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Receiving the Spirit by Calling<br>on the Name of Jesus</H2><P>When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus. First Corinthians 12:3 says, "No man can say Lord Jesus but in the Holy Spirit" (Gk.). Whenever we say "Lord Jesus," we are in the Spirit and we receive the Spirit. We have all been under the influence of tradition, thinking that we must fast and pray before we can receive the Spirit. However, it is simple to receive the Spirit&#151;just call on the name of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Enemy Trying to Take Over<br>the Land of Emmanuel</H2><P>According to Isaiah 8:7-8, the enemy may try to take over the land of Emmanuel. Do not think this word is only for the children of Israel. Today our spirit is the land of Emmanuel. Thus, we ourselves are the land of Emmanuel. The enemy, Satan, with all his army will do everything he can to take over this land of Emmanuel, that is, to take over our spirit and our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Enemy Unable to Take Us Over</H2><P>Isaiah 8:10 tells us that because God is with us, the enemy can never take over the land of Emmanuel. Although Satan has tried his best to take you over, you are still here. Perhaps during the past week Satan tried twenty-one times to take you over, but he failed every time. You are still here because of Emmanuel, because of God with us. This Emmanuel is Jesus. Today we may enjoy Jesus and experience Him in such a real way as our Emmanuel.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS<br>AND STATUS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(7)</H1><P>We come now to chapter two of Matthew. In the previous messages we have covered the genealogy of Christ and the birth of Christ. In this message we shall consider the youth of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. HIS YOUTH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Record of Christ's Youth<br>in Matthew and Luke</H2><P>If we pay attention to the four Gospels, we shall see that John and Mark contain no record of Christ's youth. John tells us that Christ is God. With God there is neither youth nor old age. God is ancient, yet unchanging. Thus, there is no problem of youth with God. In Mark, Christ is revealed as a slave. No one cares about the youth of a slave. On the contrary, both Luke and Matthew record the youth of Christ. However, as was the case with the genealogies, there is a difference between these two records of Christ's youth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Luke's Record<br>Proving the Humanity of Christ</H2><P>The Gospel of Luke proves that Christ was a perfect man. Hence, Luke's record testifies and demonstrates the humanity of Jesus (Luke 2:21-52). The items of Christ's youth recorded by Luke show that Jesus was a proper, normal man. Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day according to Jewish law (Luke 2:21). Also, according to Jewish custom, He was named Jesus on the eighth day, not on the first day. He was offered to God with the sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons (Luke 2:22-24). The fact that Mary and Joseph could only afford a small sacrifice shows that they were poor. They nevertheless fulfilled the requirement of the law. Furthermore, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem every year at the time of the feast of the Passover (Luke 2:41). This was also according to the law requiring that all Israelite males attend the feasts three times a year. Luke specifically notes that Jesus was brought to the feast when He was twelve years old (Luke 2:42). Luke also records that Jesus grew physically, that He became strong in His spirit, and that He found favor with God and man (Luke 2:40, 52). All these items recorded by Luke demonstrate that Jesus was a typical man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Matthew's Record<br>Proving the Kingship of Christ</H2><P>Matthew's record demonstrates that the young Jesus was the King of God's people (2:1-23). Luke did not include this point, but Matthew, ignoring all the points covered by Luke, dwells on it. By this we see that the Bible has an intention: in Luke it is to prove that Jesus was a man; in Matthew it is to show that Jesus was a kingly child. We shall now consider Matthew's record to see how Jesus was such a kingly child.</P><P>We should not try to understand the Bible by the black and white letters alone. We must enter into it and find something of life in it. Matthew 1 tells us that the Old Testament contained prophecies concerning Christ and that the people of God were waiting for His coming. In Matthew 1 Jesus came. Christ has been brought into humanity; He has appeared on the earth. Chapter two continues by showing the way to find Christ. His coming was prophesied, He has come, and He is here. However, there is the problem of how to find Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Found in Bethlehem by Pagan Men</H2><P>Matthew 1 reveals that Jesus, the Messiah, has come. If you had been an Israelite at that time, you would have said, "You tell me Jesus has come, but how can I find Him?" Thank the Lord that the matter of finding Jesus was not initiated by us: it was initiated by God.</P><P>Consider the background. At the time of Jesus' birth, there was a religion called Judaism. It was a fundamental, sound, scriptural religion that was formed, organized, and constituted according to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament. Through the record of Matthew 2, we see that Judaism was very much for the Bible. However, hardly anyone in that religion knew that Christ had come. We find no record in the New Testament that some of those religious people went to find Christ. On the contrary, there is a record that some pagan men, magi, came to find Him (2:1-12). Of course, this was initiated by God, not by them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>(1) Led by the Star, the Heavenly Vision</H2><P>God gave the magi a shining star to guide them (2:2). This star did not appear in the Holy Land. It appeared to men far away&#151;far away from the Holy Land; far away from the holy city; far away from the holy temple and the holy religion; far away from the holy Bible, the holy people, and the holy priests. Far away from all these holy things, the shining star appeared to some pagan men in a pagan land. The shining of that star stirred up these pagan wise men regarding the King of the Jews. I do not know how these wise men were stirred up regarding the King of the Jews, and I do not want to guess. There have already been too many imaginations concerning these wise men. At any rate, they came from the East, the Orient, and realized that the star indicated the King of the Jews.</P><P>The wise men had the living vision, the heavenly star, and the Jewish religionists had the Bible. Which do you prefer to have&#151;the Bible or the star? It is best to have both. I like to have the Bible in my hand, and I like to see the star in the heavens. It is best to be both a pagan and a Jew as well. As to the Bible, I am a Jew; as to the star, I am a pagan wise man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>(2) Distracted by Their Human Concept</H2><P>After the wise men experienced the vision of the heavenly star, they got into trouble. This trouble came from their natural concept. Although we may have the Bible and the star, we must recognize that trouble may come from our natural concept. The wise men saw the vision and, realizing that it indicated the King of the Jews, they assumed that they should go to Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish nation, where the King of the Jews was presumed to be (vv. 1-2). Their decision to go to Jerusalem did not come from the light of the star. They went to Jerusalem because they were distracted from the right track by their natural concept. Jerusalem was the wrong place. It was the capital and the city where the temple was located, but it was not the place where Jesus was born. Because the wise men were misled, they caused a serious problem and nearly caused the young child Jesus to be killed. If it had not been for the sovereignty of God, the young Jesus would have been killed as a result of their mistake. Their error cost the lives of many young ones (vv. 16-18). Be careful: you may have the Bible and the star, but do not follow your natural concept.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>(3) Corrected by the Scriptures</H2><P>Many times you have the vision, but when you consider the matter in your mind, you are distracted and misled by your natural concept. Your human concept distracts you from the right track. Whenever you are distracted like this, you need the Bible. After you have arrived at the wrong place, you need the right book. After the magi had gone to Jerusalem, the wrong place, they were corrected through the Scriptures. From the Scriptures they learned that the right place was Bethlehem, not Jerusalem (vv. 4-6). If they had not been misled by their natural concept, the star certainly would have led them directly to the place where Jesus was in Bethlehem. But they were distracted and went astray. Thus, they needed to be corrected by the knowledge of the Bible. When the magi had been corrected by the Scriptures, had departed from Jerusalem, and had been restored to the right track, the star appeared again (v. 9). Living vision always goes along with the Scriptures.</P><P>However, none of the religious people in Jerusalem went with the magi to Bethlehem. This is quite strange. If you had been a priest among those priests, would you not have gone with the wise men to see if Jesus had actually been born in Bethlehem? If I had been there, I certainly would have gone to find out for myself whether or not Christ had actually been born. But none of them went. They had knowledge and they could tell people that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem; yet, none of them went for themselves. Although they were for the knowledge of the Bible, they were not for the living Person of the Messiah.</P><P>How about today's situation? Many are very scriptural, but they care only for the Scriptures, not for the living Christ. If the Jewish religionists had cared for Christ, they would have gone to Bethlehem, which was not far from Jerusalem even by the ancient method of travel. Although Bethlehem was not far, none of the scribes, elders, or priests bothered to go. This proves that you can have the knowledge of the Bible without having a heart for the living Christ. To have the vision is one thing, to have the knowledge of the Bible is another thing, and to have a heart for the living Christ is still another thing. We all need to pray, "Lord, give me a heart for You. I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible. But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>(4) Led Again by the Star to Find and Worship Christ</H2><P>After the magi saw the star again, the star led them to the place where Christ was (vv. 9-10). The star led them not only to the city of Bethlehem, but to the exact spot where Jesus was.</P><P>Christians often say that to know the Lord it is sufficient to have only the Bible. In a sense, I agree with this. However, in another sense&#151;I say this carefully&#151;I do not agree fully. Although we have the Bible, we still need a living vision. The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house. The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was. At that place, the star stopped (v. 9). The magi did not need to knock on any doors; they knew where Jesus was. This proves that we all need a clear, up-to-date vision that leads us directly to the place where Jesus is.</P><P>The magi not only found Christ; they also worshipped Him (v. 11). Among the Israelites, no one was allowed to receive worship from others. That was considered an insult to God, a blasphemy against Him. According to them, only God was worthy of people's worship. But the wise men worshipped a child, and that child was God. Isaiah 9:6 says, "Unto us a child is born...and his name shall be called...The mighty God." The child found by the magi was called the mighty God. The wise men worshipped Him and they offered to Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:11).</P><P>We need to know the meaning of the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh. In the typology of the Bible, gold signifies the divine nature. This indicates that the child Jesus had the divine nature. He was divine. Frankincense signifies the fragrance of resurrection. According to our naturally religious mentality, the resurrection of Jesus came only after His death. However, before He died, Jesus told Mary and Martha that He was the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Thus, even before He died, He was the resurrection. The life Christ lived on this earth was a life of resurrection. Luke 2:52 tells us that even in His childhood He found favor with God and man. That was not something natural; it was the life of resurrection. The record in Luke 2 reveals that the child was an extraordinary child. He was a unique child because He was a child in resurrection. In His entire human life and living there was the fragrance, the sweetness of resurrection. Death could not hold Him or even touch Him. Not only was He the life&#151;He was resurrection.</P><P>Myrrh signifies death and also the fragrance of death. Among the human race, death has no fragrance; however, with Jesus there was the fragrance of death.</P><P>When the wise men presented the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh, I do not believe they knew the meaning of the gifts they offered. They surely offered their gifts under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. They presented gold, frankincense, and myrrh, signifying that the child Jesus had the divine nature; that His life would be a life of resurrection, full of the fragrance of frankincense; and that His life would be full of the fragrance of death.</P><P>When Jesus was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem with His parents (Luke 2:42). Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father's house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast (Luke 2:43). Mary and Joseph did not understand Him. They looked for Him and eventually found Him in the temple (vv. 44-48). In a sense, Mary rebuked Him. If I had been Jesus, I would have rebuked her. I would have fought back and said, "Don't you know what I'm doing here? Why do you come to bother Me?" If we read Luke's account, we shall see that Jesus did say something to them. He said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (v. 49). After He said this, He went along with them and returned with them to Nazareth. That was a real killing to Him. His intention was killed, and in that killing we can smell myrrh. That was not the fragrance of frankincense; it was the sweet aroma of myrrh.</P><P>If we read the four Gospels, the biographies of Jesus, we shall see that in the life of Jesus the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh were very prevalent. He was always living the resurrection life, and He was constantly under the killing of the cross. He did not wait until thirty-three and a half years had passed before He went to the cross to be crucified. Throughout His whole life He was continually being crucified on the cross. Thus, He had not only the fragrance of resurrection, but also the sweet myrrh of the cross.</P><P>The wise men found the kingly child Jesus in Bethlehem, which Micah 5:2 tells us is "little among the thousands of Judah." He was born in such a humble town in such lowly circumstances. However, due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place. Therefore, they offered to Him the three precious items. Each of these items signifies some precious element of the Lord Jesus' nature and life. In nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see the preciousness of the Lord's humanity, the fragrance of His resurrection life, and the sweet aroma of His sacrificial death. Even in the early days, soon after the Lord's birth, the wise men did such an appropriate thing. It exactly suited the Lord's nature and life. Their offering was certainly presented under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>It may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord's trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth. The worship and offering of the wise men truly accomplished something.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>(5) Warned by God to Return Another Way</H2><P>After the wise men had found Christ, had worshipped Him, and had offered Him these precious treasures, they were warned by God to return another way (Matt. 2:12). This other way, not the original way, was the right way. Whenever we find Christ and meet Him, we are always told not to return to the original way. Finding Christ and meeting Him always turns us to another way.</P><P>The situation today is exactly the same. We have the Bible, and Christ is coming, but how shall we find Him? The basic principle is not with the Bible. Although the Bible helps, the basic principle is with the living star, the heavenly vision.</P><P>Now we must see how we can have this star, how we can have this heavenly vision. The Bible tells us that the living star is Christ. It was prophesied that Christ would be the star (Num. 24:17), He came as the star (Matt. 2), and He remains as the star (Rev. 22:16). He is shining. How can we have Christ as the star? According to 2 Peter 1:19, the star is associated with the Bible. Peter tells us to take heed to the "sure word of prophecy." If we take heed to this sure word, something within us will dawn, and the daystar will arise in our hearts. To take heed to the sure word is to pay attention to the living Word. It is not just to read the Word; it is to enter into the Word until something arises within us. We may call this the dawn or the daystar. In 2 Peter 1:19 the daystar is actually the morning star. The word in Greek is phosphoros, a light-bearing substance. A piece of phosphorus can shine in darkness. Christ is the real phosphorus shining in today's darkness. However, the Word cannot shine over you unless you take heed to it. You must take heed until something begins to shine within you. That shining will become the phosphorus in your heart. Then you will have the daystar. You will be like the wise men, and something from the heavens will shine over you.</P><P>Christ is the star. The Bible says that the followers of Christ are stars also. Revelation 1:20 tells us that all the leading ones in the proper church life are stars. They are stars because they are the shining ones. Daniel 12:3 says that the righteous will shine like stars. Those who turn others to righteousness, who turn them from the wrong way to the right way, will shine like stars.</P><P>Today there are only two ways to have the star shining over you. According to the first way, you must come to the sure Word and open up your whole being to the Word&#151;your mouth, your eyes, your mind, your spirit, and your heart&#151;until something rises up in you and shines over you. That is Christ. The second way is to come to the shining saints, the followers of Christ. If you come to them, you will receive light. You also will receive some leading, for they will lead you to the place where Christ is.</P><P>Both ways of having the star are linked to the Spirit and the church. Immediately after Revelation 22:16, which says that the Lord Jesus is the morning star, the following verse says, "And the Spirit and the bride say..." This proves that, as the morning star, the Lord Jesus is linked to the Spirit and to the church, which is the Bride. Revelation 3:1 says that the Lord Jesus has the seven Spirits and the seven stars, and Revelation 1:20 says that the seven stars are the angels of the churches. These verses show that the stars are linked not only to the Spirit, but also to the churches. If we would have the living star or the living stars, we need the Spirit and the church. By the Spirit and through the church, it will be easy to have the heavenly vision so that we may find Christ and render our appreciation to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Fleeing to Egypt</H2><P>Christ was found in Bethlehem. This discovery of Christ created trouble. God used this trouble to bring the young child out of Bethlehem to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-18). Hosea 11:1 prophesied that Jesus would be called out of Egypt. Without the trouble that occurred after Jesus was found in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to flee to Egypt.</P><P>This is very meaningful. The wise men made a great mistake, but their mistake offered God the opportunity to fulfill His prophecy. But do not make mistakes purposely. That will not work. Try your best to do things right. Nevertheless, no matter how hard you try to be right, eventually you will make as big a mistake as the wise men did. Never say, "Let us do evil, that good may come." If you do evil, good will not come. However, if you try to be right but still make a mistake, that mistake will offer God a chance to fulfill His purpose.</P><P>Because Joseph fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, the young child Jesus escaped the first martyrdom, the martyrdom caused by the mistake of the wise men. Satan is always busy, waiting for an opportunity to cause martyrdom. However, God is sovereign over all, even over Satan, to preserve His dear ones from the enemy's wiles. By God's sovereignty the young Jesus was preserved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Raised in Nazareth</H2><P>At this point I need to present a little history. Although you know the story, you may still need more light. Mary conceived a child in Nazareth (Luke 1:26-27, 31). According to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem. Under God's sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire (Luke 2:1-7). This forced all the people to return to their native places. Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their hometown. Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born. The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born. Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1. After Herod had died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land (Matt. 2:19-20). When Joseph had returned and had learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem. Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised (vv. 21-23). For this reason Jesus was called Jesus of Nazareth.</P><P>What does all this mean? It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident. Sometimes I have even used the word "sneaky" to describe it. Everyone called Him Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene. But the Bible said that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. The hidden way of Christ's birth bothered all the religious people. When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah. Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth. Immediately Nathanael said, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (John 1:45-46). Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information? It is difficult to say. Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene. Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth, but in Bethlehem. Nathanael was troubled. However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, "Come and see" (John 1:46).</P><P>On another occasion, Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him. The Pharisees asked him, "Are you also from Galilee?" (John 7:52). Galilee was a Gentile region, and the Bible says "Galilee of the nations" (Matt. 4:15). The Pharisees seemed to say to Nicodemus, "Are you from Galilee? We know that Jesus came out of Galilee. But out of Galilee there comes no prophet." Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem. That was His somewhat hidden and secret way of appearing to people.</P><P>The principle is the same today. I refer you to the type of the tabernacle. The tabernacle was covered with rough, tough badgers' skin; outside, it did not appear to be very attractive. Inside, however, was fine linen, gold, and precious stones. The spiritual principle of the church is the same. Do not look at the church from the outside. You need to come inside the church. I am sure that if the Apostle Paul would come to visit you, you would be surprised. You would ask, "Are you Brother Paul? I thought that the Apostle Paul would be like a shining angel. But what are you? You are just a small man without a comely appearance."</P><P>We should never make a display of ourselves; neither should we ever know others according to the outward appearance. We must know them according to the inward spirit. In appearance, Jesus was a Nazarene, but within Him there was gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Within Him there was the glory of God. Second Corinthians 5:16 says that we should not know Christ or any man after the outward appearance. Rather, we must discern the inward reality of Christ.</P><P>We must keep this principle today. In order to find Christ, we must have the shining star. We must not go according to the outward appearance, but according to what is within. If you would know the church or the saints, do not be bothered by the outward appearance. Do not give any value to outward things, such as huge cathedrals, large church buildings, or pipe organs. Forget all that. Jesus had nothing outstanding outwardly. He was a little Nazarene, One who grew up in a province that was called "Galilee of the nations" and who was raised in a city despised by people&#151;"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" But if you "come and see" and get into Him, you will appreciate Him and be caught by Him. Likewise, you need to come into the church and stay with the church for some time. If you do, you will find something precious. The same is true with the seeking saints. The more they seek the Lord, the more they hide their experiences of spiritual things. You need to go to them and stay with them. Then you will get into them and find the riches that are within them. You will see the frankincense, the myrrh, and many other precious treasures. Then you will be attracted and caught. This is the way to find Christ and to appreciate all He is and all His precious items, the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</P><P>Matthew 2:23 says, "He shall be called a Nazarene." Some have guessed this word Nazarene refers to "Nazarite" in Numbers 6:2. Others have guessed that it refers to the Hebrew word for branch, netzer, in Isaiah 11:1. But I do not think that we have to guess that much. We know that in appearance Jesus was a Nazarene. This was spoken by the prophets.</P></body></html>
