   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING SERIOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND STUDYING CONSCIENTIOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One may say that we are all learning here.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am happy for you, because there is a rare opportunity for you to learn to serve the Lord in this environment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This will expand your horizons and enrich your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can practice speaking for the Lord in the district meetings on the one hand, and learn to take care of home meetings and group meetings on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only do the brothers and sisters have spiritual needs, they also have psychological and physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Meeting all these needs necessitates the whole church to go on together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But how to take the whole church on so that the whole church will be on the right track, how to help the saints to have a life in the Word, in prayer, and in the enjoyment of the Lord s table, as well as how to have gospel activities, these are your responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The success of this matter depends totally on the carrying out of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will have to apply all that we have learned in these two years to the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must spend most of our time and manpower on the home meetings and the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that we will no longer preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The door-knocking to preach the gospel must not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We still need to teach new trainees how to knock on doors, to preach the gospel, and to get people baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must even take out the newly saved ones to knock on doors to preach the gospel with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we carry out the group meetings and bring the new ones to serve, this includes the matter of knocking on doors to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In conclusion, the church in Taipei is a big church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the present situation with the meetings, we have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The whole church is divided into more than eighty districts, under the twenty-three meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meeting halls are mainly for administration, and the spiritual caring, nourishing, educating, guiding, and serving are all carried out in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, what we need to study the most is the matter of the various kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to do more research to find out the proper way to have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Meanwhile, we who are coordinating in the services, the regular serving ones in the church and the full-timers in the training, are all within the boundary of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these people are like materials piled up on a site, and not built up yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We still do not have a definite way to coordinate them together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we must spend time to study to find out what we lack and what we must avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, from the information gathered through experiments, we will find the proper way and apply it to the practical need of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on November 17, 1987.</S>
