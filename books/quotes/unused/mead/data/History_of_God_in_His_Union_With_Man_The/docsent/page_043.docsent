   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. WORKING ON ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to see God's history in the life of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we look at Abraham's life, we need to see it from the proper angle, the angle of the history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was with the Brethren, they stressed that Abraham had two kinds of descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One was likened to the stars of heaven Gen 15:5 , and the other was likened first to the dust of the earth 13:16 and second to the sand on the seashore 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These three expressions involve the heaven, the earth, and the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are the stars in the heaven, the dust of the earth, and the sand on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to consider the significance of these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 13 tells us that God came to visit Abraham after his nephew Lot left him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God was a real friend to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He realized that Abraham was lonely, so He came to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The servants of Lot had been fighting with the servants of Abraham, and this fighting was due to the shortage of land.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Abraham said to Lot, "Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left" v. 9 . Lot looked at the land around them, and he chose the plain toward Sodom because that was fertile.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That plain was well watered and was like the garden of the Lord and the land of Egypt v. 10 . Lot chose the best part of the land, and he departed from Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the Lord spoke to Abraham and said, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Northward was toward Lebanon, southward was toward Egypt, eastward was toward the Euphrates, the Great River, and westward was toward the Mediterranean Sea, the Great Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As much as Abraham could see in these directions, God would give to him and to his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, God told him that He would make his seed as the dust of the earth v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Genesis 13 there was a quarrel over the land, and Lot chose his portion, which was the best portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in chapter fourteen there was a war, and in that war the very place chosen by Lot, Sodom, was defeated and taken, and Lot, his family, and all their possessions were captured.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Abraham found out about this, he armed his trained servants, three hundred eighteen men, and he defeated the invaders to deliver Lot and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, Lot, his family, and his possessions were all recovered 14:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lot was recovered back into safety, but Abraham may have wondered what he would do if the four kings whom he had defeated would return again to fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that juncture, God came in. This time God asked him to look up at the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God said, "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be" Gen 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This implies that God was training Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham's earthly descendants could be captured but not his heavenly descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was as if God said, "Abraham, I, the almighty God, Jehovah, am not only giving you descendants from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am also giving you descendants from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your enemies can deal with your descendants from the earth, but they cannot do anything with your heavenly descendants."</S>
