At that time the Lord opened up to us all the verses in the New Testament concerning the matter of Christian meetings
To use an illustration, the big meetings are like preparing a big feast; not everyone can make such a preparation
The small home meetings are like home cooking; everyone can do it, and comparatively speaking it is easier than preparing a big feast
For a big feast, you only need to hire a few good cooks with a few helpers, and you will have many delicious dishes
From the record of the Bible and from history, we can see that the way Christians meet has always been on a downward course
Virtually no more attention was paid to the small meetings, and all the attention was paid to the big meetings
Two centuries after Luther, at the time of Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren, the matter of church meetings was touched
If you read the history and writings of the Brethren, you will not find much evidence that they emphasized meeting from house to house
Although the term suggests something close to a home meeting, actually the two meetings were in two different districts of Shanghai
Some small groups began with meetings in the homes, but gradually they also moved to schools or other larger facilities
We cannot take the way of the denominations, emphasizing only the big meetings, with only a small number of people who can deliver messages
It was not that there were piles of material lying around, and one day suddenly they all came together to become a building
Truckloads of material came in, but there was the need for some to do the fine work of building all the wood, stones, and steel together
If we only gathered the material but there was no one to build then after all these years of rain and wear the material would all be ruined
God's created way of meeting, as recorded in the first few chapters of Acts, was to have small meetings as well as big meetings
We need the big meetings to gather in the building material, for without the material there can be no building
When we live by this spirit, spontaneously the husbands can love their wives, and automatically the wives can submit to their husbands
When you are stirred up, you forget that you are to honor your parents, or that you are not to provoke your children
Christ indeed lives within you, but you may not have much realization of what it means to be crucified with Christ
It will ask you to deal with your sins, your trespasses, your selfishness, and even your self, your disposition
Since you love the Lord, come to meetings, seek after the Lord, and pray, surely the Holy Spirit will flow through you
If you have not experienced this enlightening recently you must realize that this is a proof that you are definitely not in the flow of life
When this life flows, it shines within you, causing you to see your own corruption, sin, desire for the world, and selfishness
If you are such a person, whenever you come to the meetings you do not need to say much, and you do not have to exhibit yourself
The minute you pray sing or share you are the riches the strength the freshness the vitality the attraction and the support of that meeting
By allowing Him to remove these things little by little, we will be cleansed and will be able to enjoy all that He is
Bless every heart and spirit, so that we would touch You from within, and we would touch this way of the spirit
May we live this kind of living day by day and moment by moment, a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through our human spirit
These two kinds of living are both for the strengthening of our present practice of small group gatherings in the homes
At Pentecost after the three thousand were saved, it is possible that the same night they began to meet in the homes
It was not difficult to have seven or eight people come together to discuss the news and chat about their families
The reason for the failure of the small group meetings is that believers are not saved in a thorough, strong, and living way
When my youngest daughter had her first baby boy seven or eight years ago, we visited our little grandchild in the hospital
The baby was so thin and small in the incubator that we were concerned whether he would be able to grow up at all
Although the human life is wonderful, we Christians have a more wonderful divine life in addition to our human life
The realization of many Christians concerning the matter of salvation is that we were fallen sinners who were in need of the Lord
Today He is not only on the throne, but He is also the Spirit waiting for you to believe in Him, call upon Him, and receive Him
Even a lower form of life such as the plant life, which has neither sense nor consciousness, is very wonderful
The Bible talks about humility, and it also talks about love, forbearance, patience, and other similar virtues
O glorious Christ, Savior mine, Thou art truly radiance divine; God infinite, in eternity, Yet man in time, finite to be
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
The Bible explains in detail how all that belongs to the Father is inherited by the Son, and how all that the Son is, is in the Spirit
We must drop our religion and philosophy, and we must drop our ethics, our morality, and all our customs and habits
In no other way could we be Sanctified and share Thy vict'ry; Thus only spiritual we'll be And touch the life of glory
The Triune God, the Creator of the universe, who was incarnated, died on the cross, and rose from the dead, is now the life-giving Spirit
Now we should walk according to this mingled spirit and live a daily life that is inseparably attached to this spirit
They read into the Bible many things of culture, teachings, ethics, morality, religion, philosophy, customs, and traditions
The result is that your whole being will be filled with the Triune God, so that in every part of your being you will see God
We Chinese have been taught this way from our youth, and in our daily life we are very much controlled and governed by these teachings
As far as Confucius is concerned, this kind of behavior is good, and as far as morality and ethics is concerned, it is excellent
As the New Testament apostles came to realize, even the ordinances that were given by God in the Old Testament have all been set aside
Paul shows us in the book of Galatians that if a man desires to keep the law, he is severed from Christ and has fallen from grace
The bright virtue of Confucius is the conscience that Wang Yang-ming, another Chinese philosopher, spoke about
All the teachings concerning the development of the bright virtue are the result of the highest discoveries of the Chinese philosophers
The Spirit of God is the life-giving Spirit who has passed through creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
The way of the higher teaching is in the development of the bright virtue; but the teaching of life is in walking according to the spirit
When we wake up in the morning, no matter how busy we are, we should spend a few minutes to have a time with the Lord
If you will walk according to the spirit all day long, you will surely be filled with joy and exultation within
For this reason, when we come to serve in the church, we should take our concepts from the Bible, and not from the world
Our service to God in the church should be one where the body is presented, the mind is renewed, and the spirit is burning
Verse 12 says For even as the body is one and has many members but all the members of the body being many are one body so also is Christ
If you study thoroughly verses 12 and 13, you will see that the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ is nothing but a living
When it gets into you, without water to dissolve it, it is difficult for the nutrition in the food to saturate your cells and blood stream
We have no desire to gather the brothers and sisters together merely to have one person speak while all the rest listen
If we have a few hundred or a few thousand people meeting together, how could it be possible for everyone to function?
It is for this reason that the Bible mentions both the big meetings in the temple and the small meetings from house to house
Suppose you have begun to meet in your home, and you have seven or eight people meeting together as a small group
If you put five of them on a team and ask them to play ball, of course they will not have the strength to play
We must have a kind of living that is initiated from the Holy Spirit and which passes through the human spirit
Many Christians do not have an adequate knowledge concerning the Spirit; hence, they have no way to experience the Spirit
The Bible tells us first that the God in whom we believe and whom we worship, serve, and enjoy, is a Triune God
God is triune because He desires to work Himself into His created and redeemed people, that is, into us who have believed
In creation His main goal was to create man as the center, so that man could become the object of His dispensing
The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-became flesh and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years
In this life-giving Spirit there is the Son, and there is also the Father; there is God, and there is also man
The Bible tells us that this Spirit in resurrection is the resurrected Christ , who is also the pneumatic Christ
Essentially speaking, the Triune God entered into the disciples on that day to become their life and life essence
The Bible says that this Triune God died on the cross for our sins, and dealt with sin, the world, Satan, and all the negative things
The Bible says again that He rose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit, and that He has entered into those who believe in Him
If someone should pray without stopping in our prayer meeting we should say While our brother is praying let us all have some fellowship
Spend five minutes before the Lord to breathe and pray, and you will feel like a tire having air pumped into it at a gas station
The Spirit in you will become your inward constituent, and in this Spirit Christ comes and is added into your being
Only then will you be a living member of the Body of Christ, and only then will you be a part of Christ as His member
To receive this Spirit we need to believe the words of the Bible, and every day we need to come before the Lord to open up to Him
When this pneumatic Christ operates in you, He will move into your mind, into your emotion, and into your will
After a few hours of softening up by water and digestion by the stomach, the food will permeate into your cells and blood stream
No one would ever say that eating and drinking are a frustration, because eating and drinking are an enjoyment
We saw during the last two weeks that psalms are not just for singing; they are also for speaking to one another
Not only should we sing to one another in psalms, but we should also speak and even teach one another with psalms
Without God's creation of the earth, and without Him supplying the sunshine, the rain, the wind, and the air, the crop cannot grow
In the prison the Chinese prisoners were apportioned hard dough, while this Greek brother was given white bread and milk
After man fell, God ordained that man must labor and sweat and that woman must undergo the suffering of childbirth
The more you pass your time here the healthier cleaner and nobler you will be you will have a higher morality and a more uplifted humanity
Now they are coming to the church meetings, and you should feel happy, because the Christian meeting is the best form of entertainment'
Rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore, It is better to sing than be sighing: It is better to live than be dying; So let us rejoice evermore
When the church first came into being, the disciples met daily in one accord in the temple and from house to house
We must have this concept, because once you have this concept, you will not go with the attitude of attending worship services
Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
If this is the case, our meeting will become living and enjoyable, and you will see the riches of Christ displayed here
For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit'
To each one of us is given the manifestation of the Spirit, and we all have a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge to speak
Wherever two or three gather together, we have a small group meeting, and we are told that we must meet into the name of the Lord
Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit,' and 2 Timothy 4:22 says, 'The Lord be with your spirit'
Although you can have a strong wind blowing outside, without opening the windows, there is no way to have any air
It was not until John Wesley was raised up by the Lord to speak for the Lord that he began to preach on the streets
After another century, Christian worship services in England again became so dead that the Pentecostal movement was started
When he said this everyone began to pay attention to the Pentecostal movement and to practice speaking in tongues
After this, the winter solstice festival passed, and a sister who loved the Lord very much died of tuberculosis
She told that brother Wong not to prepare any funeral, and that his wife would rise at twelve o'clock noon the next day
My point is this: the reason why all these Pentecostal tongue-speaking things came about is because Christianity is too dead
Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26 also tells us that tongues can be interpreted; it is a language that can be interpreted
For this reason they come up with the explanation that tongues are not necessarily a language; it can be sounds of the tongue only
For these people, surely you do not need to teach them to speak in tongues; they can all speak in tongues fluently
The Chinese speak in tongues with a Chinese accent, and the Americans speak in tongues with an American accent
The tongue-speaking of the Pentecostal movement is wrong, but the principle of opening our mouth to speak in the meetings is right
For this reason when we meet together, we must meet in the Spirit and into the Lord's name; that is, we have to meet into the Lord Himself
If we would be like this, then when each one of us comes to the meeting, we will have a few words to say about Christ
His words are, 'Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both'
He also said that the death of the Lord operates in us, in order that His resurrection life may be dispensed to others through us
We may still be talking when we walk up the stairs to the meeting hall, but once we sit in our seats we become quiet
Some say that we have to be proper and quiet when we come to worship God, but actually this is the way of degraded Christianity
Paul was not downtrodden or disappointed when he met with difficulties, but he could still say, 'Rejoice in the Lord'!
In the meetings every one of us, whether a brother or a sister, whether young or old, can all speak by this spirit of faith
Gradually he will become more proficient and by the age of eight or nine he will become very fluent in the language
They can fellowship, and they can even pray on the telephone, but when they come to the meetings they can neither fellowship nor pray
You say that you come to the meetings to worship God, but if your mouths are shut it is difficult for you to be released to serve God
Corinthians 123 says No one speaking in the Spirit of God says Jesus is accursed and no one can say Lord Jesus except in the Holy Spirit
Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
We see that it is not one or two persons speaking while others listen; rather, it is everyone having a psalm, or a teaching, or a revelation
A strong country and a healthy society depend not so much on the masses or the communities as on strong individual families
We can use the big meetings to gather in the people; but those who are gathered in have to be brought into the small groups
In the small group meetings we are determined not to have any leaders; everyone is a leader, and everyone will speak
You have to put the burden on your shoulders, and you have to take the lead to pursue a life of living in the spirit
It does not mean that they prophesy in the sense of foretelling, but in the sense of speaking for and speaking forth God
Verse 10 says, 'Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body'
He is not influenced if others speak things suitable to his taste, and he is not bothered if others speak things contrary to his will
There is not the situation where when everyone gathers together each one testifies of his personal experience of the Lord in his daily life
In the small group meetings we do not need preaching; everyone can testify of his daily experience of the Lord
May all of us, family by family, one by one, whether young or old, newly saved or not, exercise in this matter
Whene'er we meet with Christ endued, The surplus of His plenitude We offer unto God as food, And thus exhibit Christ
The Bible gives us a type in the Old Testament to describe the situation of God's people when they gather together
God commanded that three times a year they had to bring the rich produce of their land to offer to God and to satisfy God
When we come together we should present this Christ whom we have experienced and offer Him to God to be His food
As it takes doctors to handle sickness and lawyers to handle legal disputes so some assume that it takes pastors to handle Christian worship
To have two or three gathered together into the Lord means that they are led out of themselves to gather into the Lord
Whenever we come out of ourselves and into the Lord Jesus, we will be filled with psalms, songs, and praises from within
God's intention is not only that all men be saved, but that they would all come to a full knowledge of the truth
The sad thing is that many of our brothers and sisters, especially the Chinese among us, would never open their mouths
The Bible says that after the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven, He poured out the Spirit of power upon His believers
When the brothers and sisters come to the meetings many are illprepared therefore when they speak there is no spirit and there is no faith
If a man has been speaking the words of the Lord for a number of years, the words to him will almost become a psalm
You need to practice in everything-what is the subject; what is the verb; what phrase goes first; and what phrase should come next?
We all desire that the Lord would have a way in His recovery, and we all desire to grow in life and be filled with the Lord within
We treasure the Bible, but the words of the Bible must be opened up before we can receive light from the Bible
Rather, they are meant to help people to unlock the Bible, and to supply them with spiritual life and nourishment
Every brother and sister who meets with us in the Lord's recovery should pursue the way of the small group meetings
In this way the small group meetings will surely be rich, strong, fresh, living, attractive, and able to support people
May we all strive in this matter, and may we all learn and practice together, so that the Lord may have a way among us
When you speak, you should not speak as if you are writing a formal composition; rather, you should speak in an ordinary way
Most of them can go up to the platform and give a sermon, but many of them cannot speak the Lord's word in their daily life
They might have ranked first in the national examinations, but it is possible that they could not write a letter home
The writer of the article said that morning is the most precious time, and that the best way to spend the morning is to have morning watch
Sometimes when you have your morning watch, you try to hurry a little because you want to be on time to go to work
At other times you may not be in a hurry, but you may use your time to read in a light way and talk to each other
When we come to the Bible, we should have the attitude that we are coming to the Lord with His Word in our hand, taking the Word as Himself
You should not read the Bible merely with your eyes; neither should you merely memorize or understand it with your mind
The translators of the King James Version rendered the first part of 2 Timothy 3:16 as 'All Scripture is given by inspiration of God'
There was no need for any training in order for the disciples to become accustomed to the Lord's visible presence
On the road to Emmaus the Lord walked with the two disciples, listening to them as they discussed the Lord's death and resurrection
When they came to a village, the Lord was about to journey on, but they asked Him to tarry, and the Lord stayed with them
In dealing with the disciples after His resurrection, the Lord seemed to appear suddenly and disappear suddenly
When the time comes you just fall on your bed and sleep, and when you wake up you do not care to tidy up anything
You say that you love the Lord, but during the day do you spend a few minutes to fellowship with the Lord and to talk to the Lord?
In this way, the Lord's word will automatically be constituted into you, and spontaneously you will have the burden to speak for the Lord
He told us that today the most simple language in the world is the Hawaiian language but even this language has at least thirteen consonants
Why is it that today, of the two hundred mentioned in this article who speak in tongues, all doubt their genuineness?
When it was time for them to stop to eat, they threw their tools aside, waved their arms around, and shouted some nonsense
A brother read in some books that even in ancient Egypt and Babylon, a kind of tongue-speaking was practiced in the places of idol worship
In order to build up the church, there must be the small groups, and to build up the small groups, our concepts and ways must be changed
Everyone who comes to the meetings must learn to speak for the Lord, and everyone must open his mouth to speak forth Christ
In order to achieve this, all the responsible brothers who minister to the children of God must labor diligently
In order for the churches in the Lord's recovery to be strong, we cannot depend on one man preaching in the big meetings
If necessary, we need to go to others to deal with all our unrighteousnesses, so that our conscience can be without blemish
Whenever we come to the Lord's Word, it is as if we are coming to the Lord Himself, fellowshipping with Him face to face
Rather, we are using the Life-study messages to open up and unlock the Bible to us, so that we can have a deeper understanding of the Bible
At times some terms in the messages may be unfamiliar; you may want to explain them briefly while reading them
There are times when you can singread when you come to a passage that touches you you can put the words to a short tune and sing it together
In the account of Acts 4:31, on one hand there is prayer, and on the other hand there are the Holy Spirit and the word of God
If we will repent, confess our sins, call on the Lord, believe in Him, and receive Him, our sins will be forgiven, and God will justify us
By faith we will enter into Him and have an organic union with Him, and in faith we will testify of our organic union with Him by baptism
Today, in the twentieth century, especially in the United States and in Taiwan, education is popular, and the standard of education is high

On Saturday his son went to the University of California at Berkeley and contacted eleven people who were all adults
Beginning with kindergarten, and then advancing to first grade, second grade, and so forth, the children should be taught grade by grade
We do not need to have more meetings, but we do need to utilize two meetings per week to give some educational teaching on the truth
In order to do this, we need someone who can spend the time to write the lesson book and someone who can spend the time to learn it
If we can give one lesson on each Lord's Day, when a saint stays in one locality for a year, he will receive fifty-two lessons
In most of our prayer meetings, after praying for one hour, the burden is discharged and the praying atmosphere is almost gone
Because it is still early and the saints do not want to leave, we may do some unnecessary things to fill in the time
We should no longer have routine meetings Lords Day morning preaching evening breaking of bread Tuesday prayer and Thursday small gathering
If we meet in such a habitual and routine way, we may all come to the meeting but have no feeling concerning what happens in the meeting
Approximately ten years ago, many of the English-speaking young people among us had an attitude of not wanting to study
They thought that the Lord would come back in a few years and that even if a person had very little education, he could still make a living
In order to make a living, the brothers were content to do some gardening, swimming pool cleaning, or carpentry
He is now an expert in Greek and has become one of the most useful assistants among us in doing the translation of the New Testament
You will then have knowledge and wisdom, and you will be able to supply others and speak the Lord's word in the meetings
In other words, we have increased by more than five hundred churches in five continents in the past thirty-six years
On one hand we need to rise up to build up a spiritual education, and on the other hand we need the adequate prayer
It is necessary to read the Bible, the Life-study messages, and books on the truth so that we can build up ourselves in the truth
The Lord Jesus told us not to worry about what we should eat, what we should drink, and with what we should clothe ourselves
In this way, you will be not only a man who receives spiritual education, but a man saturated by the Holy Spirit
After considering the three things in Acts 431prayer the Holy Spirit and the word of Godwe need to go on to consider four additional things
There are some who have become weak, sick, backslidden, stumbled, and troubled, and who have stopped coming to meetings
In order to do these four things, we need to be those who are fully saturated with the word and those who pray
It is then that we are able to preach the gospel, release the truth, minister life, and have the riches to nourish and recover others
They may still not believe because you said this a number of years ago, and you are still saying the same thing today
You can then tell them that man has three parts-a body to eat food, a soul with a mind to read books, and a spirit within the depths of man
You should share with him the benefit that you have received from the word of truth and those things that the holy Word has built up in you
Sometimes unconsciously, while you are speaking the truth, one word may touch the depths of his being; then he will be able to rise up
Today if we want the Lord's recovery to have a future and we desire that the church be built up, we must labor in the word of the Lord
We need to remember that to bring up our children and make them useful persons requires more than twenty years of laboring
We do not want to take the Pentecostal way, thinking that once a person speaks in tongues everything is accomplished
