   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The executor of a testament is the one who is responsible for the effectiveness of the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every item of the testament is our rightful portion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the executor is faithful, every item of the testament will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only if the executor is not faithful will we fail to receive an item.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for us not to receive all the items of the testament because the Lord Jesus is the faithful Executor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What we should receive are cleansing, life, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three things include every need in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus died and resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He not only left His testament, but He became the faithful Executor of the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we should no longer live a poor, dry, and powerless life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should rise up and run, exercising our faith to receive all that the testament has promised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since one baptism is enough for a Christian, why must the breaking of the bread for the remembrance of the Lord be done again and again?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did the breaking of bread occur every Lord's Day in the church at the time of the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The answer to both questions is that the cup is the cup of the new covenant which, every Lord's Day, reminds us that the Christian standing is based on a covenanted relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The blood speaks of God's grace, while the cup speaks of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cup is the cup of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every Lord's Day we call to memory the new covenant, and every time we remember the cup, we receive all that this cup contains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord said that we have to drink this cup because it is the cup of His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we should not merely see the physical grape juice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the cup of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord wants us to drink until we are full and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should drink all that He has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord wants us to remember that He is bound by the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is happy to give us everything according to the promise in the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He wants us to always remember that we can enjoy forever all of the things in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every time we remember the Lord before God, He shows us these things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The bread is to remember the Lord, and the cup is also to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord deals with us according to the condition stipulated in the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, every time we remember the Lord, we remember Him in the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you want to be filled with the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you want to know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you want to be cleansed?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are all easy to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews 8:10-12 mentions three things: 1 God will impart His laws into our mind and inscribe them on our hearts; He will be God to us, and we will be a people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 We will not teach our fellow citizen and brother by saying, "Know the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All will know Him from the little one to the great one among us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3 He will be propitious to our unrighteousnesses and will not remember our sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can see that the new covenant includes three distinctive areas: 1 God has given us the power of the new life so that we can have the strength to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 We can now do what we could not do as brothers and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3 God gives knowledge to us according to the new covenant so that we will realize that His death is our death and that His punishment is our punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we believe in Him, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, we are forgiven and cleansed of our sins; they are not merely forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our sins are forgiven; they are not cleansed by time or by forgetting about them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can forget sin for a while, but the conscience does not die; it only sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day our conscience will wake up and condemn us again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our conscience will not be at peace forever.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, God has caused the Lord Jesus to die, and the problem of our sins is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The problem of our sins is forever solved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God caused the Lord Jesus to die in order that our sins may be forgiven and our unrighteousness cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the same time, He put us into a new position and into a new home so that we can begin to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we begin to serve God, we will feel that this is wrong and that is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we think that we do not know how to serve God and deal with God, we will suffer much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will think that had we known God's will earlier, we would not have made this and that mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not have knowledge from God, we will be tossed in sorrow day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But let me say that God has not only forgiven our sins, but has given us the knowledge to know Him so that we can know God's will and God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are not those who merely know God's will, but those who know God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The meaning of this is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It means that we do not have to ask God before we can make judgments and discernments according to God's judgments and discernments.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some brothers and sisters can understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But the new covenant is not limited to this; it allows us to know God's heart and to judge and discern based on His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But let me say this: it is one thing to know God's will and God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is another thing to be able to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must not only know where we should go.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must also have the power to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Within the new covenant, God has given us the power.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has not only given us knowledge, but also the power to carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, since this is the case, what more can we ask?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we have this, we have to say that we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are forgiven and cleansed, and have received the knowledge, life, and power, we are satisfied before God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must know that God has only given us one new covenant; He has given us nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God is supplying us and filling us with this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The first item in the new covenant is cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This has to do with salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The second item is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This has to do with our understanding of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The third thing is life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This has to do with our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the first item is reliable, then the second and third items must also be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Why have so many people received the first item and so few received the second and third items?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A believer can receive all three items at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is no need for receiving at different times, and there is no need to seek God a second time to obtain these.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whoever will rise up today and cling to God by faith, saying, "God, Your covenant has said that I can know God, understand God, and know Your method.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I can know God's heart, God's nature, and God's way."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This knowledge is not the knowledge that we ordinarily speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, the eternal life enables us to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This knowledge has no distinction of age.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Not only can the young ones know God, but the older ones can know Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we have knowledge, life, and power, they will be useless if we are not cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>That is why there is the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, this does not mean that when we receive the new covenant, we experience these things in three different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Many people consider salvation and victory to be two different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Actually, there is no need to divide salvation and victory into two different stages; we do not need a second work of God's grace before we can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Salvation, victory, and power can be received at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because some people's lives are sick, they need a second work of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Paul did not have a second experience; he was filled with the Holy Spirit from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Not every saved person can be as mature as a faithful and experienced believer immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A Christian needs to grow, but growth does not mean that cleansing, receiving life and power, and receiving knowledge have to be in different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Young Christians cannot be as experienced as those who are faithful in the Lord and who have followed the Lord for twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But neither should they be in a condition of failure like many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>How many Christians today listen to the inner voice and know how to be led by God?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>How many can do the right thing without the need for others to teach them?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Many people need others to tell them what they should do and should not do, or else they will make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Some people are very loving, patient, and good.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But they need someone to be their head.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In everything, they ask others what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>How many can go on according to the Bible and the inner leading, without asking others what to do?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>How many have received the truth, power, life, knowledge, and cleansing that are contained in the new covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>How many among us are powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We know that power does not come from us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>As soon as temptation comes, we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We all know that we are weak; our hearts melt as water Josh 7:5 , and we cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But in the new covenant, there are wonderful provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The new covenant meets our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>No one needs to add anything to it or take anything from it.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God has done a perfect job; it cannot be more perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is what every Christian ought to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>God saves a Christian and gives him three things so that he can live without want for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Before we were saved, we considered what we should do about our sins and what we should do when our conscience was not at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We wondered what would happen if we repented.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>When we heard that God would forgive all of our unrighteousness and forgive our sins, we wondered about His willingness and ability to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We did not realize that God sent the Lord Jesus to the earth to save us, that His covenant confirmed it, and that we did not have to wait any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Now we can realize the glory within God's new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>With the new covenant, there is the cleansing, knowledge, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>However, those who do not have faith will remain unchanged.</S>
