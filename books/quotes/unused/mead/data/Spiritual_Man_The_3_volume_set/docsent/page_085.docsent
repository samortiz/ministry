   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A very common mark of soulish believers is talkativeness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not that they do not know that they should be taciturn, but when they are emotionally excited, they have a great urge to get into endless speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once they talk, they lack the power of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their mind seems to lose control when their mouth opens, pouring out endless words like an avalanche.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not that they have not considered what to speak but rather that once they speak they cannot restrain themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever they speak proceeds out from the thoughts which they have been thinking all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They know that they should not be garrulous, but once they indulge in speaking, they cannot withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, when other people talk too much, they realize that it is inappropriate, and they criticize secretly in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since their words are many, offense is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They lose either harmony with others because of arguments or love because of criticism, or they even lose control of their heart because of talkativeness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since soulish believers are talkative, sudden thoughts surely come to them in their conversation, causing them to change topics or expand the thought in their conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although soulish believers know that saints should be godly and should not speak words of jesting, they always like to speak and to hear jokes when conversing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They like to hear any kind of lively or youthful talk, or whatever talk can cheer their mood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesting is indispensable to soulish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet this is not absolutely true, because sometimes they abhor ungodly talk, except that they cannot do so consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever their emotion is stirred, inevitably they follow the way of merriment to pursue pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Soulish believers are fond of "pleasant looks" and have a concept of aesthetics.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They like to follow the artistic view of the worldly people and change their own taste accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not have the attitude of being dead toward the human concept of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, it is unavoidable that they are often proud of having the view of an artist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Soulish believers often act in extreme ways.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They go either to one extreme or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may either admire art extremely or not care for beauty at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even their shabby clothes may not bother them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, they consider this as their suffering with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Little do they know that believers should pursue cleanliness not beauty .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Soulish believers who are intellectual express their being soulish by assuming themselves to be "Bohemians."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When there is a breezy morning or a moonlit night, they will invariably chant in a heroic or mournful tone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oftentimes they grumble about their lives and even shed tears of anguish uncontrollably.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They love literature and admire its beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They also like to hum and intone as if by reciting some poems they have the marvelous feeling of transcending the worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They also enjoy traveling and the sights of mountains and rivers to thus be closer to nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Very often they have the thought of escaping from the world and living in seclusion because they see the worsening condition of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While they are pondering such thoughts, they think how transcendent and how noble they are!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems that all the other believers are defiled and unbearably vulgar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such believers often consider themselves very spiritual, not realizing how utterly soulish they are!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, it is very difficult for such soulish ones to enter into a wholly spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are completely controlled by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their danger is that they are complacent and do not realize their peril.</S>
