   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAILY SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is our living of salvation, which is lived out by our daily relying on the Lord after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Work out your own salvation Phil 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Chinese translation, which says, Carry out the work of your salvation, does not convey the meaning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no such sentence in the original language of the entire New Testament, and there is no such thought in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our salvation is not something we can work to carry out; rather, we obtain it freely through God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our salvation was something we could work to carry out, it would be out of our own works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s Word clearly states that we are saved not by our works but by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The meaning of work out your own salvation is that we should live out the salvation we have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have received salvation; now we need to live it out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We receive God s salvation as soon as we believe, so the question of our eternal salvation is resolved; however, after being eternally saved we still must live out God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main elements in God s salvation are the divine life and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, living out God s salvation mainly means to live out the life of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not something we can do as soon as we believe; it requires obedience with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our receiving of salvation is by faith, and we receive it once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our living out of salvation is by obedience, and we must be in fear and trembling daily, even moment by moment, to work this out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As soon as we are saved, God enters into us to be our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we are saved, our willing and our working are according to the operation of God within us for the accomplishment of His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must be in fear and trembling every day to obey God s operation within us to make us blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation among whom we shine as luminaries, manifesting God s life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is how we can live out God, who lives in us as our salvation, and this is also how we live out the salvation we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The salvation spoken of in this verse is not the salvation that Christ accomplished on the cross as our Savior; it is the salvation of Christ as our Priest in the heavens cf. v. 24 . This is not the Lord s salvation for redemption of sins but Christ s salvation through intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we are saved by faith, the Lord gives us daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s salvation as our Priest is based on His salvation as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His salvation of intercession is based on His salvation of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His daily salvation is based on His eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a distinction between these two kinds of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord as our Savior redeemed us from our sins and gave us eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord as our interceding Priest gives us a daily, instant salvation that saves us every day and solves our daily problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the former case, we received eternal life, and in the latter, we are enabled to live a heavenly life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s eternal salvation saves us eternally, and the Lord s daily salvation saves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word uttermost refers not only to time but also to extent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s daily salvation with respect to time saves us to the end and with respect to extent saves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This daily salvation comes from the Lord, who is always living in the heavens as our great High Priest to intercede for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Deliver us from the evil one Matt 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being delivered from the evil one is to be delivered from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said that we should pray this prayer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, this is part of the daily salvation we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan tempts us daily, even hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He attacks and attempts to ensnare us; therefore, we need the Lord to deliver us from the evil one every hour of every day.</S>
