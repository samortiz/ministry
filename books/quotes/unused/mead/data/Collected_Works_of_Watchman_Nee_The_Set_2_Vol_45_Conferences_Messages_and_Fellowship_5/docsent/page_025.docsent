   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only that which issues from the depth will touch others' depth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only the outflow of the indwelling Spirit will touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit must operate not only in the speaker, but also in the listener.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only when the Spirit works simul- taneously in the speaker and the listener will God's word bring light and life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a church is not living in the Spirit, it is not qualified to receive any deep messages, because it cannot tell the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only thing that will give light and life to men is revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is easy to conduct a revival meeting with some churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With other churches, one must have some specific utterance from the Lord before he can speak anything with impact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, all he can do is amuse others' ears and minds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE DELIVERANCE OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Hsu asked: How can a wrong person receive deliverance from God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Answer: It is useless to say anything to some people, either briefly or in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After they listen to you, they remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is like preaching to an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how well you explain salvation to him, he is still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for us to experience deliverance, we first have to understand our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to know of our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are dead, of course, we will know nothing about our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But as long as we are alive, we have to know our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The knowledge of our own problems is the first step toward deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one ever gives his own keys to others as a gift, because no two locks are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if we give someone our keys, they will not fit their lock.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for us to solve others' problem, the first thing we have to do is to know what their problem is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem with many people is basically a mental one; their minds have never received the light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way of deliverance lies in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The cross that I am talking about is not a cross in teaching or doctrine, but a cross that operates in our life in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross works and operates through light, that is, the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This cross is not merely a historical fact or a doctrine, but a reality that operates through light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the cross comes, it is light, and when it shines into the darkness within you, there is no escape; you will see and will receive the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The truth sets you free and delivers you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is useless for you to know the doctrine of the cross merely in the mind; it will not produce any effect in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you see the cross in revelation and are put on this cross, you will cease to live because the cross means nothing less than death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you hear a message and afterwards you are still alive, it means that the message was merely a doctrine to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real cross is something drastic, something that forces you to have some dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The cross manifests its power through the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not a "thing" that suddenly comes to you; it is a light that shines on you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you can no longer bear your natural life, the cross is operating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I must repeat this a hundred or even a thousand times: It is light that kills.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The searing light of the cross will destroy you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not enough for you merely to know this fact from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must realize the inner working of the cross through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sin is a very obvious thing, yet many people still do not know what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not a matter of how much Bible teaching you have, but of how much truth you realize.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a matter of how much you have been enlightened and how much reality you have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord shine on us constantly with the light of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May everything that issues from the natural life be terminated and all natural energy and wisdom be removed so that we can become proper persons.</S>
