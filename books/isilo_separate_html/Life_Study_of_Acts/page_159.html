Although he was very much occupied with his work in Ephesus, his spirit was burdened for Jerusalem. If we read Romans 15:25-31, we shall see that Paul was burdened to bring financial help from the churches in Macedonia and Achaia to the poor saints in Judea. Paul also refers to this in 2 Corinthians 8, where he indicates that the giving of material things is altogether a matter of grace. Therefore, Paul&rsquo;s purpose in going to Jerusalem was apparently to minister to the needy saints. Actually, Paul had a deeper reason for purposing in spirit to go to Jerusalem.</p><p>I believe that from the time of Acts 15 Paul did not have peace concerning the situation in Jerusalem. If we study the book of Acts and all of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we shall have a clear view of the Lord&rsquo;s move on earth in His New Testament economy. The Lord&rsquo;s move started from Jerusalem and eventually reached Antioch. The &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of the Lord&rsquo;s move went from Jerusalem to Antioch, and turned from Antioch to the Gentile world. However, the source, the &ldquo;spring,&rdquo; of this flow in Jerusalem had been &ldquo;poisoned.&rdquo; Since the source was poisoned, the poison would be carried by the flow wherever it went. This was the reason Paul could not be at peace concerning the situation in Jerusalem.</p><p>It is likely that Paul had the burden to help Peter and James to improve or adjust the situation in the church at Jerusalem. The situation there was one of mixture&mdash;a mixture of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with the things of the Old Testament dispensation. As we have seen, this mixture is evident in James&rsquo; fellowship in 15:13-21. As we shall see, the mixture of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with the old dispensation is very obvious in chapter twenty-one of Acts. This mixture was very offensive to the Lord. Realizing that the problem still existed in Jerusalem, Paul was not at peace about the church there.</p><p>We have seen that at the end of his second journey of ministry Paul went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church there (18:22). He made this trip to Jerusalem because he always endeavored to maintain the oneness of the Body and to keep a pleasant feeling between him and the saints in Jerusalem. From this we see that whenever there was an opportunity Paul would go to Jerusalem to visit the church in order to keep a pleasant relationship between him and the church and also to seek to render some help to the situation there. Because Paul was concerned for Jerusalem, he purposed in spirit, in spite of the difficult and promising situation he was in, to go to Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">A BROADENED HEART FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S INTEREST</h2><p>Acts 19:21 indicates that Paul had a broadened heart for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. As he was encountering attack at Ephesus and carrying on his ministry, he still purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, and from there he was eager to go to Rome. Concerning this, he said, &ldquo;I must also see Rome.&rdquo; If you consult a map, you will see that Ephesus, in Asia Minor, was midway between Jerusalem to the east and Rome to the west. While Paul was laboring and facing attack at Ephesus, he had the heart to care for the situation in Jerusalem and also to see Rome. What largeness of heart Paul had!</p><p>Not many of us have such a large heart. Rather, often those who are laboring in a certain place will say, &ldquo;I am very busy here. I do not have the heart to care for any other place. Furthermore, I am facing much opposition. How can I have the burden for other places?&rdquo;</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s attitude was very different. In the midst of his situation he could still purpose in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, and then express the desire to see Rome. As we have indicated, Paul eventually went to Jerusalem, and, in a marvelous and sovereign way, he did see Rome.</p><p>According to Galatians 2:8, Paul&rsquo;s part of the New Testament ministry was among the Gentiles. Although his burden was for the ministry among the Gentiles, he was still concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s interest universally. His primary concern was for the whole Body of Christ, not only for his part of the New Testament ministry. Paul realized that it would be very difficult for the Body of Christ to be built up fully as long as the religious mixture in Jerusalem was allowed to remain. Because he had a clear view concerning the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament move, he was troubled by the situation in Jerusalem, especially as it related to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy to build up the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY AND THE LORD&rsquo;S UP-TO-DATE MOVE</h2><p>In the fourth message of this Life-study of Acts we pointed out the need for a dispensational transfer, a transfer out of the old dispensation into God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In studying the book of Acts it is important that we see all the crucial matters related to this transfer. If we are clear concerning these matters, then we shall understand today&rsquo;s situation, and we shall know where we need to be and what we need to do. We should not remain where Apollos was in chapter eighteen, but go further to follow the apostle Paul, the one whose eyes were opened to see fully God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Therefore, in studying this book I do not have the heart for other matters. My burden concerns God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we can be helped to see the crucial turning points of God&rsquo;s dispensation, I shall be satisfied. My desire is that the light regarding God&rsquo;s New Testament economy will penetrate our being. If this light penetrates us, then we shall see the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move in His economy.</p><p>I believe that this study of Acts will be helpful to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to see that we are not carrying out an ordinary Christian work. Rather, we are here in the up-to-date move of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Therefore, we must have the vision of God&rsquo;s economy. If we have this vision, we shall be directed and carried on by it in the right way. If we have this vision, we shall not be distracted by today&rsquo;s situation, no matter what it may be. If we have this vision, we shall know where we are and where we are going. Having a clear view concerning God&rsquo;s economy in this age, we shall know what our goal is. We believe that our God is still moving, that He is still going on. Therefore, we need to be in His up-to-date move.</p><p>We may compare the view of God&rsquo;s economy presented in Acts to a jig-saw puzzle. When the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle are put together, we have a complete scene. In like manner, throughout the book of Acts we have various &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; of a complete &ldquo;puzzle.&rdquo; When we fit these pieces together properly, we shall see a clear and full view of God&rsquo;s economy. When we reach the end of this Life-study we shall have all the necessary pieces, we shall fit them all together, and we shall see the complete &ldquo;scene&rdquo; of the New Testament economy of God. I am especially burdened that the young people see the view of God&rsquo;s economy presented in this book.</p><p>In order for the Lord Jesus to come back, His bride needs to be prepared. Consider the situation today in relation to the readiness of the bride. To be sure, the bride is not yet ready. The only way the bride can be prepared is the way of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I say this so that we all may know what the Lord is doing here in His recovery. If we know what the Lord is doing, then we shall know where we are and what our goal should be. May we all be helped through this study of the book of Acts to be fully up-to-date in the Lord&rsquo;s move for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_158.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_160.html">Next</a> </body></html>
