<h2 class="head1">REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Regeneration is a miraculous normality. Some inner life teachers said that it was not so easy to be regenerated, and they called regeneration the &ldquo;first blessing.&rdquo; I read a number of writings in an attempt to understand what regeneration is, but I could not find the answer until I read an article by Brother T. Austin-Sparks. He said that regeneration was to receive God&rsquo;s divine life in addition to our human life. I was happy when I read that definition. From that day I understood what regeneration is. To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit (John 3:3, 5-6), thus obtaining God&rsquo;s divine life to become the sons of God (John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>When I checked with my experience and the experiences of other believers, I found out that regeneration is not difficult to experience but that it is a very normal experience. Regeneration is instantaneous. It is like taking a picture with a camera; at the appropriate time a &ldquo;click&rdquo; captures all the scenery onto the film. This &ldquo;click&rdquo; takes less than one second. After we began to preach the gospel by visiting people, some wondered how people could be regenerated within fifteen minutes. But regeneration takes place instantly. We instructed the full-time trainees in Taipei to use the booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> in their preaching of the gospel. This booklet talks about God&rsquo;s creation, man&rsquo;s fall, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s dispensing. After reading a portion of this booklet to a person, we can say, &ldquo;Please follow me to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; After leading him to call on the Lord in a strong way, we can read Romans 10:13 to him to assure him of his salvation&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; Then we can read Mark 16:16&mdash;&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; When we preach the gospel like this in a proper way, we are &ldquo;taking the lens cover off of the camera.&rdquo; Then we can lead this one to the water of baptism, and when we are baptizing him, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, we baptize this one into the Triune God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is such a person genuinely regenerated? Actually, only the Lord Himself knows who is genuine and who is not, who is real wheat and who is a tare (Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43). It is impossible to discern the tares from the wheat until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow but that of the tares is black. When they sprout, blossom, and bear fruit, everyone can discern the difference between them. Our responsibility is to get the camera ready by pointing it toward the scenery and taking the lens cover off. This is all that we can do, and this is all that we have to do. We leave the actuality and reality to the Lord. We have observed, however, that many have been genuinely regenerated instantly. This is miraculous yet normal. It is a miraculous normality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY</h2>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit essentially (Acts 13:52) is to be filled in our spirit (Eph. 5:18) for our spiritual living. To be filled with the Spirit economically (Acts 4:8, 31) is by the outpouring of the Spirit of power (Acts 2:17-18), clothing us with power from on high (Luke 24:49) for our spiritual work. Some inner-life teachers said that after being regenerated, a person had to receive what they called &ldquo;the fullness of the Spirit.&rdquo; This terminology is not so accurate. Fullness is the expression of the riches. But they used the word <em>fullness</em> for the infilling. What they meant by this term was the inward filling of the essential Spirit. They referred to this matter as the second blessing. They did not differentiate the infilling of the Spirit from the outpouring of the Spirit. The infilling is within us, and the outpouring is upon us.</p>
<p>The disciples received the Holy Spirit within when the Lord came back to them on the day of His resurrection and breathed the essential Spirit into them (John 20:22). On the evening of the day of resurrection, the disciples received the inner Spirit of Christ essentially. Later the Lord charged them to wait in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high. To be clothed is different from drinking of the inner Spirit as revealed in 1 Corinthians 12:13. To drink is to take the water into us, and to be clothed is to put the clothes upon us. To drink of the water is something related to the inner life, whereas to be clothed is related to our outward work in our duty or position.</p>
<p>Forty days after the disciples had received the inner Spirit, the Lord charged them to wait for the promised Spirit, which would come in another ten days. At that time they would receive another aspect of the Spirit, the economical aspect. The essential aspect of the Spirit is for our life and living and the economical aspect of the Spirit is for our ministry and work. The Spirit entered into the disciples essentially when the Lord breathed into them, and on the day of Pentecost, fifty days later, the Spirit came upon them economically (Acts 2:2-4,14-18). The economical Spirit of power equipped them to accomplish their commission.</p>
