<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Three Stories</H2><P>The ark was of three stories, the lower, the second, and the third (6:16). The first, second, and third stories signify the height of the ark. The three sections of the tabernacle signify the depths into which we all must enter. The three stories of the ark signify the height which we all must attain. In one sense we are getting deeper, and in another sense we are getting higher. Undoubtedly, the three stories of the ark signify the Triune God. In the Trinity of the Godhead, we always say, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Which Person of the Trinity is the first story? It is easy to say who is the second, for we all know that the Son is in the middle. But is God the Father or God the Spirit the first story? In Luke 15 we find three parables: the shepherd recovering the lost sheep, the woman seeking and finding the lost coin, and the father receiving the returned prodigal. The first parable concerns the Son, the second concerns the Spirit, and the third concerns the Father. According to our experience, the Spirit firstly came to us, found us, brought us to the Son, and inspired us to believe in the Son. After we believed in the Son, we called, "O Father." The Spirit brings us to the Son, and the Son brings us to the Father. When we come to the Father, we are in the third story.</P><P>The Gospel of John is a book of the Son, and the First Epistle of John is a book of the Father. In the book of the Son, we have grace, but in the book of the Father, we have love. Love is higher than grace. In the Gospel of John we have the truth, but in the First Epistle of John we have the light. Light is higher than truth. The Gospel of John is good, for it brings us to the Son. The First Epistle of John, however, brings us to the Father. We all must go on from the Son to the Father.</P><P>The first story of the ark is of the Spirit. Many Christians like to talk about the so-called baptism in the Holy Spirit and about the charismatic things, but this is all in the first story. We all must go to the Spirit in order to know the Son, Christ. To know Christ is different; it is higher. Someday we shall all reach the story of the Father. This is the highest, greatest, and most mysterious.</P><P>Suppose I have a residence of three stories. If you are not my special friend, I would only admit you into the first story. I would not allow you into the second. If you are my good friend, I would admit you into the second story. However, unless you are so intimately related to me, I would never bring you into the third story to show you some of my mysteries, secrets, and hidden treasures. I would not dare to reveal to you my secrets and my riches. Who would be allowed into the third story? Certainly my wife would be there. The outsiders could never get into the third story.</P><P>Suppose that you are now in the ark. Would you prefer to stay in the first, second, or third story? I have no doubt that Noah, his sons, and daughters-in-law were in the third story. The lower beasts and creeping things might have been in the first story and the higher animals in the second. I can testify to you that I have passed the first story. I want to go higher and higher.</P>
