   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Called to the Participation in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen from 1:9 that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, into the participation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that we have been called into the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, the way to enjoy this fellowship is to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again I say, we have been called by God to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has called us to call upon this unique name, the name which is above every other name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should turn from considering the names of persons and places and concentrate on the unique name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cross of Christ is also part of the unique solution to the problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first work the cross does in our experience is to terminate us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to my observation, brothers are usually more willing than sisters to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout all my years in the Lord s recovery, I have seen few sisters who were willing to be terminated by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you realize that every wedding is a termination?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a sister gets married, she puts a covering on her head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This covering is a sign of termination and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a sister is not willing for such a termination, she should not cover her head at the time of her wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, a married sister loses her maiden name and takes another last name, the name of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The cross works in us to terminate us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, Christ is our enjoyment; on the other hand, the cross is our termination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From experience we know that the more we enjoy Christ, the more we are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the cross works to terminate us, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not do anything except remain restfully in the place of termination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a wonderful fact that whatever is terminated by the cross is redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How encouraging this is!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The enjoyment of redemption depends on the experience of termination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Certain saints have little enjoyment of redemption because they are not willing to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross solves all the entanglements we face in the church life and especially in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to my experience, married life can be very entangling, bothersome, and puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What can untangle all the complications and solve the problems?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need an instrument to cut through the entanglement, and this instrument, this cutting knife, is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only the cross can save us from the entanglements of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are cut by the cross, we are not entangled by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Human life is filled with problems and entanglements.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simply to be alive is to encounter problems and troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is true not only in the married life and family life, but also in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the human way, negotiation is the means of solving problems or resolving entanglements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A brother and his wife may attempt to solve problems in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, this is not the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s way is to supply you with Christ and terminate you by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever there is a problem in the family life or in the church life, the natural man may immediately try to negotiate and solve the problem through conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By the Lord s mercy I can testify that whenever I face this temptation, deep within I have the sense that there is no need for me to talk or negotiate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My only need is to go to the cross and be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Christ comes in with the supply to solve every problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is God s way to solve all the problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should pay our full attention to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is our unique preference and choice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, we need to have a proper understanding concerning the cross, realizing that the purpose of the cross is to terminate whatever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to take this cross and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the unique solution to all problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To the Jews the cross is an offense, and to the nations it is foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But to us, God s called ones, it is truly God s power and God s wisdom 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to our natural, cultural mentality, it is foolishness to be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But as called ones we know that the cross is God s wisdom and His power.</S>
