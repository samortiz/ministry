   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Three Matters That Should Also Be Emphasized</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to the above, we should also pay attention to some other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must know the sphere of our work, the object of our work, and the move of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to pay attention to these three others matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Service of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether we are preaching the gospel, bringing in a revival, or pursuing the knowledge of life, all three should be for the building up of the church, and all of them should be done in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be deeply impressed and should recognize clearly that the service God wants is the church service, that is, a corporate service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He does not want personal service, that is, an individual service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, the result of all service should cause the church the Body of Christ to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should also know that the church is expressed practically in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The universal church is what most people call the invisible church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not practical enough.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church must be practical and local to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, our service and work must be conducted in the local church and must build up the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should encourage and lead the brothers and sisters in each locality to rise up to serve and work together in their respective locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gospel should not be preached just by the so-called workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It should be furthered by all the saints striving together in one accord and in one soul for its advancement Phil 1:5, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The service should not be limited to a small number of so-called servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, all the saints should serve together as priests 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In every locality, the whole church should preach the gospel, the whole church should rise up to serve, and the whole church should work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our service and work, our individual element should be reduced to nothing, and our personal work should disappear in the face of corporate church service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our work and service must be done in coordination, and our coordination must be carried out in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how great or small we are, we are all members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how small we are, we cannot be less than a member.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should have a deep feeling that we cannot be independent in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must feel that we need the coordination of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Helping the Young Believers</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pay particular attention to the young people in our work in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today Satan's organizations and philosophies pay particular attention to young people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Can we not infer that God is paying attention to young people as well?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean that the souls of older people are not precious in God's eyes, but it does mean that for the sake of God's work and for the future of the gospel, there is more hope with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our gospel work should place special emphasis on high school and college students.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should spend and pour out our all to save, cultivate, edify, and lead these young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In leading the young people, there are three things we should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Knowledge of Life</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once a young person is saved, we should help him take care of the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should teach him how to fellowship in life, how to deal with his conscience, how to deal with his personal matters, how to have a thorough consecration, and how to practice absolute obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more earnestly and strictly they practice these things, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Knowledge of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it is right for a person to receive worldly education when he is young, it is more right for him to receive spiritual education when he is young.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must help and lead the young believers to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We want them to receive a strong education in the truth of the Bible while they are still young.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This has much to do with their future service to the Lord; it is something they can draw on for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should encourage them to set aside definite, adequate, and prime hours for the systematic reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In particular, they should devote many of their vacation days to reading the Bible extensively.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not need to get into the profound meaning of the Word at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They only need to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more familiar they are with the Word, the better it is for them.</S>
