   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The One into Whose Name the Believers Are Gathered Together</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus Christ is the One into whose name the believers are gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning this, Matthew 18:20 says, "Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus gathers us not in His name but into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the principle of the New Testament, the name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the name is the person, to be gathered into the Lord's name is to be gathered into the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the name of the Lord Jesus is very much linked to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, the Spirit is the reality of the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's name denotes His person, and the reality of the Lord's person is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that to be gathered into the name of the Lord, that is, into the Lord Himself, is to be gathered into the Spirit. a. For Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our being gathered together by the Lord into His name is for the purpose of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The most crucial thing in the believers' meeting is to be gathered into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we are the Lord's and have been saved by His name, we should gather only in that name and meet only in that name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must not gather into and meet in any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the meetings we need to be gathered out of so many other things into the Lord's name, into His person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We especially need to be brought out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot be gathered together into the Lord's name if we stay in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name. b.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Enjoy His Presence in Their Midst</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 18:20 says that where there are two or three gathered into the Lord's name, He is in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus gathers us into His name so that we may enjoy His presence in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His presence is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we are gathered into the Lord's name, into His person, we enjoy His presence in a special way, and His presence brings us enlightenment, grace, supply, and all kinds of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>37.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The King</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 21:1-11 Christ is presented as the King, in particular, as the meek King.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Shortly before the end of His life, the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even though the people despised Him and rejected Him, He came to them as the King. a. Meek and Lowly</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 5 says, " Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.'"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies the humble and lowly state in which the Lord Jesus was willing to be, for the donkey and the colt together give an impression of meekness and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heavenly King did not come with haughty splendor but with gentle, humble meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The presence of the colt testified that the Lord Jesus did not come to Jerusalem to fight or to compete.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, He was meek and lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This, I believe, was the impression that He wanted to convey to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yes, the Lord Jesus was the heavenly King, but He did not have the intention to come as a great King fighting or competing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He came as a meek, lowly King who did not fight against anyone or compete with anyone.</S>
