   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ and the Believers Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Living Stones for God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From his days as a young disciple, Peter never forgot that he was a stone or that Christ was the rock on which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, when Peter had grown old, he wrote in his first Epistle, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are living stones not for exhibition but to be built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no need for us to wait for the next age; God s house is being built on earth in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>People today often speak about serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 5 reveals that the real service, the service God desires, is not something separate from the building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Service needs to be based upon the building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We first need to be built together; then we can serve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Building in Paul s Writings Growth in Life for Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>into Precious Materials for God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul also wrote concerning the building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians he wrote that he fed the saints 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also wrote, We...were all given to drink one Spirit 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to eat of Jesus and drink the Spirit for our spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Growth brings in transformation, and transformation prepares the proper materials for building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, in 3:9 Paul wrote, You are God s cultivated land, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s farm is for growth, and God s building comes out of the growth of God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to eat and drink that we may grow and be transformed, and then the building will be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is an apparent disconnect in the thought in 1 Corinthians 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A farm is for growing plants, but a building is built with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spiritually speaking, plant materials, such as wood, grass, and stubble, are not suitable for God s building v. 12 . Although we are plants on God s farm, we are becoming precious stones through the process of petrification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we allow the water of life to flow through us, this water brings in all the divine, heavenly minerals, which are all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flow of the divine life brings the divine element into us and discharges our old element.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way we are transformed from plants into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we are plants, but we are in the process of petrification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are growing as plants on God s farm to be transformed into the precious stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Taking Heed How We Build</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>upon the Foundation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul spoke strongly concerning the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But let each man take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one s work, of what sort it is vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not add wood, grass, or stubble to God s precious building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Jerusalem there will be nothing natural, only precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ Being the Foundation Stone, the Cornerstone,and the Topstone of God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Ephesians 2:20 Paul wrote that Christ is both the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets and the cornerstone of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cornerstone is placed to join two walls of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Jewish believers and the Gentile believers represent different walls in God s building, and Christ stands as the connecting cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The foundation stone lies horizontally to support the whole building, and the cornerstone stands vertically to connect the walls of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Zechariah 4:7 Christ is also revealed as the topstone to cover God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The foundation stone supports the building, the cornerstone connects the building, and the topstone completes the building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone of God s building, and we are precious stones to be built into this building.</S>
