[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE LORD S RECOVERY EATING Scripture Reading: Rev 2:4, 7, 14-15, 17, 20, 24; 3:20; 22:14 I. A PROFOUND CONCEPT IN THE BIBLE
[2]  The Bible contains a very profound thought that cannot be fathomed or perceived without revelation: God wants to enter into man to be man s life that He and man might have the same life, the same nature, and the living of the same kind of being a God-man.
[3]  If you do not have God s life and nature and if you are not filled with God, you are an empty vessel, and your human life, your living, your feeling, and your activities are all vain.
[4]  To believe in the Lord is not just for our sins to be forgiven or for us to go to heaven; rather, it is for us to receive the Lord into us that He may be mingled with us as one essence.
[5]  Before man chose the way of eating the Lord, Satan came in. People usually say that man fell because of sin.
[6]  Actually, man fell because he ate of things that were other than God.
[7]  God wants man to eat God Himself, but Satan wants man to eat other things.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE ORGAN FOR EATING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; Isa 57:15; Ezek.
[9]  36:26-27; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; John 6:63 I. THREE GREAT THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE
[10]  Zechariah 12:1 shows us that in the eyes of God there are three great things in this universe: the heavens, the earth, and man.
[11]  Brothers and sisters, it is a fact that we have a spirit within us.
[12]  CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 24, 30; 12:13, 3b; Acts 9:14; Rom 10:12; Isa 55:1-2, 6, 10-11; Lam 3:55-57 I. CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD
[13]  Therefore, our status and our position are that we are saints, those who call upon the name of the Lord.
[14]  The name of the Lord is Jesus, and the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, the person of the Lord.
[15]  The Lord Jesus is real; therefore, when you call, He comes, and the One who comes is the Spirit.
[16]  If you live in a place and you have not called on the Lord s name to such an extent that all your neighbors know that you are a believer in Jesus, you are a defeated Christian.
[17]  Isaiah said, Hear Me attentively, and eat what is good, / And let your soul delight itself in fatness v. 2b . Therefore, besides calling upon the Lord s name, we also need to pray-read the Lord s word.
[18]  We have already seen clearly that eating the Lord is the way to enjoy the Lord.
[19]  Eating the Lord, which is a spiritual expression, is really calling on the Lord.
[20]  For many generations, although many were seeking God, they did not see definitely that calling on the Lord s name is the way to enjoy the Lord.
[21]  If you read the whole Bible carefully, you will see that this matter of calling on the Lord was already there in the Old Testament; it began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind Gen 4:26 .
[22]  The more you call, the more you receive the supply of the Lord; the more you call, the more you are watered by Him; the more you call, the more you are filled with Him.
[23]  Whether you are sitting at home, walking on the way, riding in a car, eating a meal, or even talking with people, when you call, O Lord! the Lord is right in front of you.
[24]  I told them, Sisters, I don t like to refute your argument, but I can tell you a fact: Call on the Lord and you will sense sweetness; call on the Lord and you will be watered; call on the Lord and you will touch Him!
[25]  When you preach the gospel to someone, you may think that if you can make the message logical and clear to him, he will then believe in the Lord.
[26]  Furthermore, the Bible shows us that when we are offering sacrifices to God, that is, when we are giving thanks to God, we must also call on the Lord.
[27]  Thus, he went on, Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation v. 3 . How do we draw this water? The well of salvation is God Himself, and we come to draw water from this well by calling, O Lord! O Lord Jesus! When you call on the Lord in this way, you are drawing water with joy from within.
[28]  They read the Word but will not call on the Lord.
[29]  Please remember that if you do not call on the Lord, the Scriptures will be merely letters and not spirit.
[30]  Before you researched the Bible, you might have been a little alive; but after you search and research, you become dead in your spirit, because this is the wrong way.
[31]  As long as you breathe in the Lord, He will operate in you to water, enlighten, comfort, and support you; He will even carry out the work of transformation in you, not to correct you from without but to change you from within.
[32]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, you must learn to call on the Lord, and you also must learn to mingle your calling on the Lord with your pray-reading of the Word.
[33]  OF OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 3:6; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4-6 I. GOD BEING A MYSTERY
[34]  God is a mystery, and this mystery is in His being Spirit.
[35]  You may rightly say that this is to be touched by the Holy Spirit; you may also say that this is God s moving; or you may say that this is Christ living in you.
[36]  Sometimes you need to call, O Lord ; another time it is appropriate to call, O Father ; and still another time you may call, O Lord Jesus!
