   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING IN THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be deeply impressed that this good land typifies the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that in Colossians 2:7 Paul says that we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have been rooted in Christ, then He must be our soil, our earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have you ever realized that Christ is the very land in which you are rooted, that you are a plant rooted in Christ as the soil?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I deeply feel that most of the Lord s children are still in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have experienced the Lord only as the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others have come out of Egypt and enjoy Christ as their daily manna as they wander in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But very few believers experience Christ as the realm, the sphere, in which they walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that Christ is our good land and that we must daily walk in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Galatians 3:14 Paul says, That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here Paul refers to the blessing of Abraham and the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This blessing refers to the good land, and the fulfillment of this blessing for us today is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, according to Paul s concept, to walk in Christ as the good land is to walk in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Colossians 2:6 Paul tells us to walk in Christ, but in Galatians 5:16 He charges us to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, in Romans 8:4 he speaks of walking according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These verses indicate that the good land for us today is the all-inclusive Spirit who indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This all-inclusive Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ as the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After being processed, the Triune God is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today this all-inclusive Spirit indwells our spirit to be our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A number of books written by Paul, including Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, and Philippians, indicate that Christ today is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the embodiment of God and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through incarnation, He became the last Adam, who was crucified on the cross for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In resurrection this last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit, we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul says, The Lord be with thy spirit, and in 1 Corinthians 6:17, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, Christ as the all-inclusive good land is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning this, we all need the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having the full assurance that the all-inclusive Spirit is mingled with our spirit, we should set our minds on this mingled spirit Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By doing this, we are spontaneously setting our minds on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we must go on to walk in this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that we must live, move, behave, and have our being according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we shall experience Christ and enjoy Him as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing in the New Testament is more central, crucial, and vital than walking according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our spirit to be our life, our person, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our need today is to return to Him, to set our minds on the spirit, and to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is to walk in Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
