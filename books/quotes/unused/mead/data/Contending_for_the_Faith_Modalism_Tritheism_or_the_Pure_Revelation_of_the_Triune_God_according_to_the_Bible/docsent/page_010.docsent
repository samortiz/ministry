   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Son Being Called the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible declares that all Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the pure word of Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse we see two lines: that the child is called the Mighty God, and that the Son is called the Everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we accept the first line, then we must accept the second.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All fundamental Christians accept the first line that the child is the Mighty God but due to their traditional terminology and understanding, few accept the second that the Son is the Everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we read this verse in simplicity, without bias or preconceived concepts, we must confess that it means what it says that the Son is the Everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we should read this verse and testify of its truth without drawing any unwarranted conclusions from it as does Patripassianism , or without attempting to reconcile it with those portions of the Word which clearly indicate the distinction between the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One aspect of the mystery of the Triune God is that the Father and the Son are one, yet are two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 9:6 reveals that They are one, and as those who believe the pure Word of God without adding anything to it or taking anything away from it, we must simply believe that it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we attempt to twist this verse or to interpret it to match a traditional system of thought, we may be exposing ourselves, indicating that we cannot take this verse in childlike simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 9:6 clearly says that the Son is called the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, as mysterious as it may seem, the Son must be the Father, just as the child is the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must believe what the pure word of the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, believing according to this verse that the Son is the Father does not mean that we believe that there is no distinction between them, for we have already cited verses which indicate that such a distinction exists.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Gospel of John also testifies that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After speaking of the two hands, the hand of the Son and the hand of the Father, the Lord Jesus said plainly, "I and the Father are one" John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 14:8-11 we see that the Father is in the Son, that the Son is in the Father, that the Father dwells in the Son, and that he who sees the Son sees the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In all these verses the Lord clearly reveals the mystery that He and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He speaks, it is the Father who works; when men know Him, they know the Father; and when they see Him, they see the Father, for He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>76 If we attempt to reconcile these passages from Isaiah and the Gospel of John with those portions of the Word which reveal the distinction between the Father and the Son, we shall find that it is altogether beyond our capacity to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can only believe whatever the Bible says and testify of it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ, the Son, Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the clear revelation of the Scriptures, Christ, the Son, is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consider John 14:16-20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 16 the Lord says, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the Lord is saying that He will pass through death and resurrection to become another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who will come to abide with us and dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 17 the Lord says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this verse the Lord says that the Spirit of truth will abide with us and be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, in verse 18, He says, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Examine these verses carefully and notice that the "he" of verse 17 is the "I" of verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In effect, the Lord is saying, "When He comes, I come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is I, and I am He."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, in verse 17 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality will be in us, and in verse 20 He says that He, the Son, will be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that that Spirit who is in us is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since there is only one Spirit the Holy Spirit this means that the Lord is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is confirmed by Romans 8:9-12 which speaks of "the Spirit of God," "the Spirit of Christ," and "Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>77</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Undoubtedly, the last Adam is Christ, the Son, and certainly the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is only one Spirit who gives life the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is not the Holy Spirit is to teach that there are two life-giving Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us, rather, be simple enough to believe 1 Corinthians 15:45 without trying to explain it away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Commenting on 1 Corinthians 15:45, one writer says, "Here we see the Spirit and Christ identified in a remarkably intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the standpoint of faith the Spirit and the Lord are identical."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>78</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What could be clearer than this?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the context of this book, the Lord here is the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit is the very Holy Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the words of James Denney, an eminent Scottish theologian of the early part of this century:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord, of course, is Christ, and the Spirit is that which Paul has already spoken of in the sixth verse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life under the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He who turns to Christ receives the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Practically, therefore, the two may be identified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here, so far as the practical experience of Christians goes, no distinction is made between the Spirit of Christ and Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>79</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Greek, 2 Corinthians 3:18 even contains a compound title Lord Spirit showing that the two, the Lord and the Spirit, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Again, if we try to reconcile these portions of the Word with those verses which indicate that the Son and the Spirit are distinct, we shall find ourselves unable to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can only believe and testify to what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"It is essential to preserve with care both sides of this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ and the Spirit are different yet the same, the same yet different."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>80</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before we conclude, let us make two further observations regarding the practical oneness of the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Revelation 5:6 says that the apostle John saw "a Lamb standing as having just been slain."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Undoubtedly, this Lamb is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this same verse John says that the Lamb has "seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That these "seven Spirits" are none other than the Holy Spirit is proved by Their being mentioned with God and Christ in Revelation 1:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, the Holy Spirit today is the seven eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can no more separate the Holy Spirit from Christ than we can separate a person's eyes from the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Just as we and our eyes are one, so Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>81</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In four strikingly similar passages in the Gospels, the Lord Jesus tells His disciples that they shall be persecuted and brought before the civil and religious rulers for His name's sake Matt 10:17-21; Mark 13:9-11; Luke 12:11-12; 21:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In each instance the Lord said something like, "Do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak" Matt 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, in Matthew 10:20 the Lord then says, "For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you"; in Mark 13:11, He says, "It is not you who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit"; in Luke 12:12, He promises that the Holy Spirit "will teach you what should be said"; and in Luke 21:15 He says, "I will give you a mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As we put all these verses together, we see that the Triune God will be speaking through the persecuted disciples of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At such times, surely the Lord's followers do not sense that three distinct Persons are speaking through them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Rather, they experience the Triune God as the three-in-one giving them instant utterance as they testify for the Lord Jesus.</S>
