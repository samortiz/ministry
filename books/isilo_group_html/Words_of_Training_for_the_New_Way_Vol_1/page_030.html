BEING TO FILL THE REDEEMED</h2>
<p>The Triune God filling the redeemed tripartite persons is a matter of His heart&rsquo;s pleasure. This pleasure of God is simply His desire, and it has become His will. This pleasure and desire of God then became His eternal plan, His intention, and His arrangement. Therefore, God&rsquo;s pleasure, will, and purpose have become His plan, intention, and arrangement. This is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Being Processed<br />
to Become the Ultimately Consummated Spirit</h2>
<p>It is according to His economy that God administrates this plan. The first step He took was creation. When the man He had created became fallen, He took the second step, the step of redemption. This redemptive work of God has to do with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In eternity, the Father arranged, designed, and intended everything according to His plan. In time, at the fullness of time, the Son came to become a man, putting on man&rsquo;s flesh, having man&rsquo;s likeness and man&rsquo;s nature, and lived among men for thirty-three and a half years. In His human body, with a human form and with the human nature, He Himself worked, preached, performed miracles, and brought His disciples to live and move together with Him for three and a half years. Then He went to the cross, being willing to enter into death to experience death. According to the flesh, He entered into the tomb; according to the spirit and the soul, He entered into Hades and remained there for a period of three days. In Hades He displayed Himself for all the principalities of death to see, proving that He is one who cannot be held by death, but has overcome death and is resurrected. He went into death by Himself; in the same way, He came out of death by Himself. Once He came out of death and entered into resurrection, He was transfigured from the likeness of the flesh to the likeness of the Spirit. Therefore in resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This life-giving Spirit is the ultimately consummated Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Breathing Himself<br />
into the Believers</h2>
<p>After the Lord had become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, He came back into the midst of the disciples. John chapter twenty records that His return after resurrection was a very mysterious thing. He was the pneumatic Christ coming back with a resurrected body (Luke 24:39-40). After He came back, He breathed into the disciples, signifying that He breathed Himself into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). This portion can also be translated, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Breath [<em>pneuma</em>].&rdquo; This was an unusual divine breath. This divine breath was God Himself. At that time, He was no longer the unprocessed God, as He had been before the thirty-three and a half years; rather, He had passed through incarnation, being conceived in a virgin&rsquo;s womb, and was born, and living among men, He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human life. Then He went to the cross and even entered into death and Hades, where He displayed His victory. Then He came out of death and entered into resurrection. Once He entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who was this very breath, the holy breath.</p>
<p>What I am speaking to you is entirely according to the revelation of the Bible. It has taken me about thirty years to be able to speak these words in this way, with the intention of getting away from the general way of speaking in Christianity, and its influence. However, I have not at all departed from the truth. This new way of speaking is not a new revelation. I am using a new way of speaking to present to you an ancient truth that is precious. It was because of this new speaking that I have provoked people to condemn me by saying that my speaking concerning Christ as the Spirit is heresy. However, let me tell you that the truth is the truth, and eventually the truth will win the victory. In order to defend their erroneous teaching concerning the Trinity, degraded Christianity absolutely will not admit that Christ is the Spirit. They say that the Father is the Father, Christ is Christ, and the Spirit is the Spirit. Nevertheless, they have no way to annul what was definitely indicated in 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and what was clearly declared in 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Triune God had passed through all the processes, He came forth as the ultimately consummated Spirit. This ultimately consummated Spirit is the processed Triune God. This One is our God and our Father. He is also our Lord, our Savior, our Redeemer, our Master, and the Spirit as well. He is our life, and our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. He is even our patience, our humility, and all our virtues. He is our all in all.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Words of Training for the New Way, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
