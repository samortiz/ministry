   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY IN GOD'S ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:12, 20; 5:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul's ministry was completed in the late A.D. 60s when he was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A period of about twenty-five years went by before John's writings appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation were written about A.D. 90.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This gap in time was under the Lord's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From what Paul tells us in Colossians 1:25 we know that Paul's stewardship which he received from God was to complete the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Word of God refers to the Scriptures, God's full revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, with Paul's writings the divine revelation should have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why was it, then, that another ministry came along after his?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ANOTHER MINISTRY NEEDED AFTER PAUL'S</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>History records that before the end of the first century, after Paul's martyrdom, the church was carried away by serious heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the revelation of God was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John's ministry came in to repair this damage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One heresy was that Christ was not God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Gospel of John was written to counter this false teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All twenty-one chapters bear strong testimony that Christ is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Gospel begins by saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John declares clearly throughout his Gospel that Christ was not only the Son of God but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 20:24-29 he tells us how Thomas doubted the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord was patient with Thomas until he was convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then Thomas said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is an example of John's testimony that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A second heresy that arose taught that Christ did not come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan on the one hand instigated the teaching that Christ was not God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Christ was not God, He must be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the subtle one on the other hand also was behind the heresy that claimed Christ had not come in the flesh; this means that He was not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice how strongly John fought these errors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After stressing in the first verse of his Gospel that Christ was God, he tells us in verse 14 that this Word which was God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In his first Epistle he warned the believers not to believe every spirit but to test whether the spirit recognized that Christ had come in the flesh 1 John 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's Person is wonderful, and it is wonderful mainly in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is that He is God; the other, that He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was these two points that Satan attacked by means of the heresies he inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a damage to Paul's completing ministry for these evil beliefs to creep in!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It meant a breakage in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another ministry was needed, not to complete but to mend.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose I have a new jacket which gets torn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It must be mended.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where the tear is repaired, that place on the jacket will be stronger than the rest of the fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John's ministry is to some extent stronger than Paul's. The fact that he wrote after Paul is an indication that John's writings are stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Compare also the Christ revealed in these two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul's main revelation is of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christ he reveals is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Colossians he presents Christ as the portion of the saints 1:12 ; the image of the invisible God 1:15 ; the Firstborn of all creation 1:15 ; the Firstborn from among the dead 1:18 ; the mystery of God's economy, Christ in us, the hope of glory 1:27 ; the mystery of God 2:2 ; the embodiment of God 2:9 ; the Head of all rule and authority 2:10 ; the body of the shadows of all positive things 2:17 ; our life 3:4 ; and all in all in the new man 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Surely the Christ Paul reveals is wonderful and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nowhere, however, does Paul reveal Christ as the universal Administrator in God's universal government.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's throne in the heavens is over the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who is the One who carries out His administration?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John tells us in Revelation 5.</S>
