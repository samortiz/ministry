 <p><strong>WEEK 12 &mdash; DAY 3</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>John 19:34 But one of the soldiers pierced His side...and immediately there came out blood and water.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 John 4:13 In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Intrinsic Essence and Significance of the Church</h2>
<p>When we speak of the essence of anything, we are referring to its most intrinsic part. Regarding the church, the most important positive factor is its intrinsic essence. Many in Christianity have made the church something outward. When some speak of the church, they mean a physical building. If they speak of going to church, they mean going to a chapel or cathedral or some kind of sanctuary....While others are somewhat improved in their concept, they still pay too much attention to the outward aspects of the church, such as its organization.<sup>183</sup></p>
<p>When God created man, He did not create two persons; He created only one man by the name of Adam....[Then] God arranged for Adam to have an increase. Eve did not come into being separate from Adam or originate outside of Adam. Eve was made from a part of Adam [Gen. 2:21-22].<sup>184</sup> Eve is a picture of the church. The church came out of Christ as a part of Christ.<sup>185</sup> One day God put Christ to sleep on the cross. According to the Scriptures to sleep simply means to die (John 11:13; Matt. 27:52). When God caused Christ to die on the cross, one of the soldiers pierced His side, and blood and water flowed out (John 19:34).<sup>186</sup> Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins (1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30).<sup>187</sup> [Therefore,] the divine life, the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ Himself, is the essence of the church.<sup>188</sup></p>
<p>[Furthermore,] we need to see what the church is.<sup>189</sup> The church is the issue of the Triune God: the Father embodied in the Son, the Son realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit mingled with us.<sup>190</sup> When God issues out, He becomes the church....The intrinsic significance of the church, from the entire New Testament, is that the church is God&rsquo;s total reproduction, God&rsquo;s continuation, God&rsquo;s increase, God&rsquo;s full growth, and God&rsquo;s rich surplus....Such a high vision of the church needs us to pray, &ldquo;Lord, give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see and to know what Your church is.&rdquo;<sup>191</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Building of the Church, the House of God&mdash;<br />
the Mingling of God and Man</h2>
<p>In Genesis 28...Jacob saw a ladder in his dream and heard God&rsquo;s promise to him. After he woke up, he took the stone, which he had used as a pillow, and set it up as a pillar. Then he poured oil on top of it, saying, &ldquo;This stone... will be God&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (v. 22)....What is the meaning of pouring oil upon the pillar of stone? When we come to the New Testament, we can see its meaning clearly....In the Scriptures oil signifies the Holy Spirit and...a stone denotes a saved person. The Lord Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). In Greek <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; Peter himself also told us that all the saved ones are living stones being built up as a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5a). Hence, we can see that oil being poured upon a stone signifies that God is poured upon man, that God is mingled with man....When God as the Spirit comes upon and into His redeemed people, the two are mingled together. This is the house of God, the dwelling place of God.<sup>192</sup> Without man, God is a wandering God, a homeless God. In the same way, without God, man is a wandering man, a homeless man. Therefore, God intends to have a building in this universe in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other [1 John 4:13]....God Himself being mingled with man&mdash;this is the church....This is the house of God. Here God has a home, and man has a habitation. Here God has a place of rest, and man also has a place of satisfaction. This is God&rsquo;s building.<sup>193</sup></p>
