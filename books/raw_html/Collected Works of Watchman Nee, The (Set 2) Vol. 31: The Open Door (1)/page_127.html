<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>On February 24 I received a letter from Ning-Hai. I was very happy. The brothers are scattered because of the war, and it is difficult to get messages to one another. When I received your letter, it was as if I were seeing your face. I was so comforted! Your remembrance of our brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing is with the same burden as our remembrance of the brothers and sisters in other localities. Although the brothers and sisters in Shao-Shing were all forced to scatter to other places, they are all safe and well. Please do not worry. The only problem is that Miss Chang Shi-jeng was in Li-Zhu originally. A few months ago I hired a boat to go and visit her, but I discovered that she had moved to Hsie-Jia-Chun in the area of Lou-Gung because Li-Zhu was too dangerous. It is difficult to get messages to her, and there is no way to communicate with her. We are not lonely in Jou-Shan. Every Lord's Day there is a meeting in Brother Ma Ting-chi's home. Mrs. Lau from Hsiang-Li comes every Lord's Day. The number of believers from Jou-Shan itself has increased quite a bit. God Himself did the work. Oh, praise the Lord! We need to pray much for one another. May God always give grace and protect us and all the other brothers and sisters. Peace.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsie Tze-yuen<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Dan-Ju-Wu, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Although the Lord's people were scattered in every place as the war spread, the Lord's gospel followed them into the mountains, bays, and coastal regions. Praise the Lord! I used to live in Shao-Shing, but I fled to my ancestral home (Dan-Ju-Wu) because of the war. In these few months several people have been saved through God's grace. There is now a home meeting every Lord's Day in Dan-Ju-Wu. There is also a prayer meeting every night. May God be with our work and may He also send more workers to reap His harvest. Please send six copies of The Open Door to this address. Peace on your way.</p><p>The least on the way,<br />Han Xiang-fu<br />April 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hsie-Chun, Wu-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Jing-yuan:</p><p>The Lord has protected me with His grace since we parted. Although we have passed through many difficulties and hardships, we have seen God's saving power in delivering us from danger. Thank and praise the Lord! The brothers and sisters returned from Hsiao-Shu to Hsie-Chun in three groups. All were safe. Eighty percent of the houses in the village were completely destroyed by fire. The houses of the believers, however, were mostly preserved by the Lord. Brother Zhang Lin-yu's house and store were burned. The whole town of Ma-Yao was destroyed. The only buildings left standing were the Presbyterian Church and the Apostolic Faith Church. Although Hsie-Chun is no longer in danger, it is not yet stable. We ask the brothers and sisters to please pray for us. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Huang Bao-kuang</p>
