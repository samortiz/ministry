[2]  Prior to 1928 Brother Watchman Nee conducted a study with a few saints on the book of Revelation.
[3]  The longhand notes of a brother who attended those meetings are published in this book.
[4]  The portion covering Revelation 2:19 3:22 is missing in the original manuscript.
[5]  In spite of the fact that a small portion is missing, this book forms a rather complete study of the book of Revelation by the author and is a valuable supply and contribution to the church in this, the end time.
[6]  Although the individual epistles were written to seven individual churches, John sent the entire book to each of the seven churches in Asia at the same time.
[7]  "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."
[8]  Although John had seen such great visions, he still called himself our brother.
[9]  "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead; and He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear; I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
[10]  The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
[11]  The messengers here definitely do not refer to the messengers of heaven because: 1 the messengers of heaven, though they serve the church, cannot bear the responsibility of the church; 2 the messengers of heaven are spiritual, and therefore, they cannot receive a physical letter; 3 since this book is revealed to John by the Lord through His angel, it cannot be that the angel writes letters through John to other angels; and 4 the Lord asks the messenger of the church in Smyrna to be faithful unto death Rev 2:10 .
[12]  Revelation 2:1 3:22 I. SUMMARY REMARKS ON CHAPTERS TWO AND THREE A. The Seven Churches
[13]  The seven churches mentioned in these two chapters were actual churches at the time of the early apostles.
[14]  Yet, at the same time, these seven churches represent the seven stages of the church, and their conditions also portray the general condition of the church in different stages.
[15]  Every epistle contains the words, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .
[16]  These seven epistles are spoken by the Lord Himself.
[17]  Why then do they say that the Spirit speaks to the churches?
[18]  "But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love."
[19]  Although the church in Ephesus was so good, the Lord still had something for which to rebuke her she had left her first love.
[20]  We may wonder why a church which labored so diligently would not at the same time love the Lord inwardly.
[21]  The church in Smyrna typifies the condition of the church during the time from about one hundred years after Christ to A.D. 313.
[22]  "Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer.
[23]  Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days.
[24]  Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."
[25]  But here the Lord tells us beforehand, "Do not fear," because 1 fear is the source of failure if you do not fear, you will not fail; and 2 the Lord has already won the victory although we may suffer, eventually we will triumph.
[26]  "After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things."
[27]  Based upon the words "the things that must take place after these things" in 4:1, some say that the things in chapters four and five have not yet been fulfilled because they concern those things which will happen at the time that the church is about to be raptured, at the Lord's return.
[28]  "Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting."
[29]  4 There is no mention that the white garments worn by the elders are washed in the precious blood; however, in other passages where the white garments are mentioned, Revelation always says that they are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb in 7:14, for example .
[30]  The white garments here indicate that the elders do not have sin.
[31]  5 The words that the elders speak are not words of redemption.
[32]  And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
[33]  "And when the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders will fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they will cast their crowns before the throne, saying, You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created."
[34]  "And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
[35]  Concerning the first six seals in chapter six: have they already been fulfilled, are they being fulfilled, or will they be fulfilled during the tribulation?
[36]  There are two supporting factors to show that they have been and are being fulfilled:
[37]  1 In Revelation 5:2 the angel asked, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?"
[38]  2 If God does not first take care of the matter of the church filling up the number of the Gentiles and then put the church aside, He cannot acknowledge and deal with the Jews see Rom 11:25-26 .
[39]  The reasons are: a Since the One who sits on the white horse in chapter nineteen is Christ, the One who sits on the white horse in chapter six must also be Christ, whom God crowns. b Since the other three horses are given power and authority by God, the first horse must also be given power by God and be crowned by God.
[40]  "And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come.
[41]  "And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
[42]  Mr. Govett said that this was the way the Old Testament saints addressed the Lord, but in Revelation 3:7, the Lord Himself told the churches that He is holy and true.
[43]  "And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood; and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
[44]  And heaven was removed like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
[45]  I dare not say that this passage has already been fulfilled in full, nor dare I say that it has not been fulfilled at all.
[46]  Some even reported at that time that there was the appearance of what is described in Revelation 6:15-16.
[47]  "Saying, Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God upon their foreheads."
[48]  "And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed."
[49]  Revelation 7:9 through 17 is a description of the rapture of the church to the heavens.
[50]  Although I dare not say definitely that they are the whole church, I do say that they are the majority of those who have been redeemed by God the majority of the church.
[51]  Yet these people in 7:9-17 are able to stand before God.
[52]  God gave the promise of rapture only to the church.
[53]  Hence, only the church is able to stand before God.
[54]  "And I said to him, My lord, you know.
[55]  And he said to me, These are those who come out of the great tribulation."
[56]  5 Revelation 11:1 makes mention of those worshipping in the heavenly temple, yet except for those in Revelation 7:9, there are none who worship God in heaven.
[57]  "Because of this they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them."
[58]  According to the foregoing text, the reason that they can serve God is because they did not take the matter of sin lightly.
[59]  "They will not hunger any more, neither will they thirst any more, neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat; for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
[60]  "And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
[61]  And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."
[62]  "And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to trumpet" Rev 8:6 .
[63]  The great tribulation may begin from the fifth trumpet because the fifth trumpet is the trumpet of woe and is close to the seventh trumpet.
[64]  "And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star out of heaven fallen to the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss."
[65]  "And it was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree, but men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
[66]  And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man."
[67]  From this we can see that these locusts have spiritual supernatural knowledge, for they can receive orders and can identify those who have been sealed by God.
[68]  The seal in Revelation 7:2-8 should be a kind of hidden sign of God.
[69]  God orders them not to harm those who are sealed, but He has not specifically ordered them to harm others.
[70]  From the words "they should not kill them" in verse 5, we can see that the harming of the unsealed ones in verse 4 is something to which God only acquiesces.
[71]  "Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
[72]  This river will become the boundary of Israel in the future see Deut 1:7; 11:24 .
[73]  Although one would dare not say that Ezekiel 38:1-3, 5-6, 10-12, 15-18; 39:1-3, 11 refers definitely to the sixth trumpet in Revelation 9, neither can one say that they are unrelated.
[74]  It can be said that Ezekiel 38 and 39 are completely fulfilled from the beginning of the sixth trumpet in Revelation 9 through the sixth bowl in Revelation 16.
[75]  THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH TRUMPETS A. A Strong Angel
[76]  "And I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was like the sun, and His feet like pillars of fire."
[77]  "And He cried out with a loud voice just as a lion roars.
[78]  And when He cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices."
[79]  "And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months."
[80]  "The court which is outside the temple" is the temple on the earth.
[81]  "These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth."
[82]  The olive trees and the lampstands were standing at the time of Zechariah Zech 4:11-14 , they were standing when John was writing the book of Revelation, and they are still standing now.
[83]  "And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth."
[84]  When a sign is revealed, it causes men to know what will come to pass.
[85]  Beginning from Revelation 12:1, the apostle John prophesies again because 10:11 says, "You must prophesy again."
[86]  Some people say that the "woman" here refers to the church, but this is not correct because: 1 before the second coming of the Lord, the position of the church before Christ is that of a virgin 2 Cor 11:2 ; 2 the church has never been typified as a mother, and it has never had any daughters names like "mother church" cannot be found in the Bible ; and 3 the church is raptured at the end, but this woman is never raptured.
[87]  "And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth."
[88]  Since everything about this woman is symbolic, her pregnancy, birth, and crying out in 12:2 must not be interpreted literally.
[89]  Since Revelation 12:2 is symbolic, this birth cannot be literal.
[90]  Some say that the man-child refers to the whole church, but this cannot be true either, because:
[91]  1 The whole church cannot be resurrected, for this would mean that the whole church has died.
[92]  Some go first, and some go later; but here all of the man-child is raptured at the same time.
[93]  3 The promise of shepherding all nations with an iron rod is not given to the whole church but to the overcomers 2:26-27 , and not all in the church are overcomers.
[94]  4 The matter of reigning is not for the whole church since only those who suffer together with the Lord may reign together with Him 2 Tim 2:12 .
[95]  "And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven.
[96]  And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him."
[97]  "And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."
[98]  "And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current."
[99]  Since "the serpent" is Satan, the "water" cannot refer just to water, but must refer to something else.
[100]  From Jeremiah 46:7-8 we know that water represents the advance of a hostile army see also Jer 47:2-4; Isa 59:19 .
[101]  "And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.
[102]  And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority."
[103]  In order to understand this portion, one must read Daniel 7:3-8 and 2:31-33: 1 The lion is the golden head in chapter two, which refers to Babylon; 2 the bear indicates Medo-Persia and is the silver breast; 3 the leopard is the bronze belly, which is Greece; and 4 the dreadful and terrible beast is the iron legs, which is the Roman Empire.
[104]  Revelation speaks of the Lord as a Lamb twenty-eight times, and it speaks of the beast as a wild beast thirty-six times.
[105]  "And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven."
[106]  The first thing the beast does is blaspheme against God.
[107]  The name of God includes the person, nature, and authority of God.
[108]  "And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed."
[109]  The second beast works by utilizing the first beast's authority.
[110]  "And that no one may be able to buy or sell except he who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name."
[111]  It is not hard not to sell, but it is really hard not to buy.
[112]  There are several kinds of marks: one is the name of the beast; one is the number of his name; and others may be various kinds of symbols.
[113]  "And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."
[114]  "And I heard a voice out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harp-singers playing on their harps."
[115]  This "voice out of heaven" is the voice of the hundred and forty-four thousand.
[116]  It is as melodious as "the sound of harp-singers," as majestic as "the sound of loud thunder," and as tumultuous as "the sound of many waters."
[117]  "And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth."
[118]  "And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people."
[119]  "And the smoke of their tormenting goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."
[120]  This shows us that once a person goes to hell, there will no longer be any chance for repentance.
[121]  The saints will not need to sleep in the new heaven and the new earth, while those in hell will not be able to sleep forever.
[122]  "And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
[123]  And another angel came out of the altar, he who has authority over fire, and he cried with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened.
[124]  And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God.
[125]  "And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished."
[126]  "And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles."
[127]  These seven angels are priestly angels because their clothing is that of the priests.
[128]  They are probably serving God in the heavenly temple.
[129]  "And I heard the angel who had power over the waters saying, You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, because You have judged these things."
[130]  "And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs; for they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty."
[131]  Revelation 17:1 19:4 should be considered as one chapter rather than three separate chapters.
[132]  Revelation 18:1-3 is the continuation and development of earlier verses since 18:3 speaks of three matters: 1 "All the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication," which is mentioned only in chapter seventeen 17:2 ; 2 "And the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury," which is mentioned only in chapter eighteen 18:11-15 ; and 3 "And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her," which is mentioned in both chapters seventeen and eighteen 17:2; 18:9 .
[133]  Revelation 16:19 speaks of the great city, Babylon, while 14:8 speaks of Babylon the Great.
[134]  How do we know that the Babylon mentioned here is Rome?
[135]  1 There is only one city in the world which is built on seven hills; that is the city of Rome.
[136]  In history Rome is known as the city of seven hills.
[137]  I. THE GREAT HARLOT AND THE BEAST SHE RIDES ON
[138]  "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters."
[139]  These are the events which come to pass after the pouring out of the seven bowls.
[140]  It is marvelous that one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls also shows John the wife of the Lamb in 21:9.
[141]  "And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
[142]  "A wilderness" here may be interpreted spiritually because the earth was originally a wilderness Psa 107:33 .
[143]  It can also be interpreted literally because the city of Rome is surrounded by desert.
[144]  "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.
[145]  And I marveled with great marvel when I saw her."
[146]  This shows us that whatever this woman has done in the past will be repeated in the future, but with more intensity and severity.
[147]  Note that it does not say that this woman shed the blood of the saints or that she shed the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.
[148]  "And are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain only a short time."
[149]  The Brethren consider the seven kings to be seven political systems, but this is against the principle of the Scriptures.
[150]  "And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition."
[151]  This verse has to be read in conjunction with 17:8.
[152]  Verse 11 also speaks of the four stages of the beast's history, which are: 1 he was, 2 he is not, 3 he is out of the seven, and 4 he goes into perdition.
[153]  "These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast."
[154]  Some have said that the beast here refers to the Pope.
[155]  "And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire."
[156]  The ten horns and the beast hate the harlot.
[157]  They do not hate the woman, because the woman, the city of Rome 17:18 , is their kingdom.
[158]  "For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury."
[159]  "And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning."
[160]  The kings of the earth have no strength to help the woman.
[161]  "Be glad over her, O heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because God has judged judgment for you upon her."
[162]  "Saints" may refer more to men of the Old Testament; "apostles," to Christians; and "prophets," to those from the second Pentecost.
[163]  "And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence and shall be found no more at all."
[164]  Although it is not known how God will destroy Babylon, it is possible that this will be done by an earthquake because in 16:19 He remembers the great Babylon after a great earthquake.
[165]  "And the sound of harp-singers and musicians and flutists and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you, and no craftsman of any craft shall be found any more at all in you, and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you, and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
[166]  "And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great."
[167]  This is the last time that the throne is mentioned this is different from the great white throne .
[168]  "And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.
[169]  And he said to me, These are the true words of God."
[170]  This verse shows us clearly that some are invited like the five wise virgins and that these are blessed.
[171]  This city is the bride of the Lamb, and only those saints who are invited and have their own righteousnesses as their garment can enjoy the glory and the beauty of the city.
[172]  "And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty."
[173]  This verse mentions three things that the Lord does:
[174]  "And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come here; gather yourselves to the great dinner of God, that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free and slave and small and great."
[175]  "And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
[176]  Revelation 9:1 says that the key of the pit of the abyss is given to Satan, with which he then does two things: 1 he causes two men to be resurrected, and 2 he causes the locusts to hurt people.
[177]  "The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed.
[178]  Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years."
[179]  "And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war.
[180]  "And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
[181]  In Revelation 21:23 we shall see that in the city there is "no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it."
[182]  "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each of them, according to their works."
[183]  "Death and Hades gave up the dead" means that the spirits of men are delivered up.
[184]  Some say that the words "the sea gave up the dead" also refer to the spirits of men.
[185]  "And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."
[186]  "But the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
[187]  "And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."
[188]  "And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain" is in contrast to "And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness" in 17:3.
[189]  F. The Materials of the Foundations of the Wall,
[190]  "And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there."
[191]  According to this verse there will still be day and night in the new heaven and new earth because the opposite of "day" is "night" .
[192]  The kings of the earth may travel to the new city during the day, but there is no night in the new city.
[193]  The condition of the inhabitants of the new heaven and new earth will be like that of Adam and Eve, because they will still have bodies of flesh and blood.
[194]  "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street."
[195]  And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His slaves will serve Him."
[196]  Revelation 22:6-21 I. THE MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL
[197]  "And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place."
