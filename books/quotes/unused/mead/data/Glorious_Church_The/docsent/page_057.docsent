   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God hates the principle of Babylon more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must note in His presence how much of our being is still not absolute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anything which is halfway and not absolute is called Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need God to enlighten us so that in His light we may judge everything in us which is not absolute toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only when we judge ourselves in this way can we confess that we too hate the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By His grace, may the Lord not allow us to seek any glory and honor outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord requires that we delight and seek to be one who is absolute, not one who is living in the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 19:5 says, "And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A special feature of the book of Revelation is the proclamations from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We read such things as a "voice out of heaven" and "a voice came out from the throne" 18:4; 19:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are declarations from heaven, signifying the time when God speaks, the place where God speaks, and what His emphasis is on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are definite reasons for the proclamation in Revelation 19:5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, it is because the great harlot is judged, and on the other hand, it is looking toward the marriage of the Lamb which is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, there is a proclamation from the throne to give praise to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has been working from eternity and has expended much energy on His work so that He might obtain praise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians mentions that God has an inheritance in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is God's inheritance in the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is only one thing that man can render to God praise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise is God's inheritance in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The voice from heaven proclaims that all of God's servants, all who belong to God, both small and great, must praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's purpose must be fulfilled, and it will be soon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God must obtain what He is after; we all must praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the voice from the throne declared that praise be given to God, there was a host of echoes resounding throughout the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 19:6 says, "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On one hand, there was a declaration from the throne, and on the other hand, there was a response of thousands upon thousands, and ten thousands upon ten thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As John was listening, he did not hear the voice of a single person; rather, he heard the voice of a great multitude as if it were the voice of many waters and the voice of mighty thunders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you listen to the noise of a great waterfall or the waves of the ocean, you will realize how loud a voice of many waters can be.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The voice of thunder is great enough; how much greater is the voice of mighty thunders!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of these mighty and thunderous voices were saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The declaration from heaven, the response from the whole universe, and every voice was saying, Hallelujah, because of a special event which was about to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The event is "the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we read this proclamation, what are our hearts set upon?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This passage does not say that we will reign and that we should therefore rejoice and be exceeding glad.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither does it say that we will receive a crown and that we should therefore praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It says that the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's mind is that He should reign, that He should exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God rules, it is Christ who rules.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us turn back to Revelation 11:15: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Our Lord" refers to God, and "His Christ" refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the pronoun "He" which follows is used rather strangely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the passage begins with "our Lord and...His Christ," it seems logical to continue with the phrase, "And they will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This would be grammatically correct.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it is not written in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is followed by the phrase, "And He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This enables us to understand that the Lord's reign is Christ's reign, and Christ's reign is God's reign.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The kingdom of God is the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reigning of God is the reigning of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because God reigns and Christ reigns, everyone rejoices with exceeding gladness and shouts, Hallelujah!</S>
