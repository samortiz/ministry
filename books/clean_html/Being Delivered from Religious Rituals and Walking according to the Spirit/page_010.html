<h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S INTRODUCING OF CHRIST<br />
BEING CONTRARY TO RELIGION</h2>
<p>John the Baptist introduced Christ in a very particular way. Instead of preaching doctrines, he proclaimed, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). The Greek word for <em>repent</em> means to &ldquo;have a change of mind,&rdquo; that is, to have a change of concept. John seemed to be proclaiming, &ldquo;Another sphere, another realm, has come. Turn and have a change of concept. Turn from your way of worship. Turn from your religious ordinances. Formerly, we offered sacrifices in the temple, set the bread of the Presence in order, lit the lamps, and burned incense, but now we must abandon these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John the Baptist did not teach doctrines to those who repented; rather, he buried them in water. John terminated and buried anyone who had a change of mind. It did not matter whether a person was a chief priest, a tax collector, or a scribe; as soon as they repented, John buried them. They were buried out of their old society, old religion, old culture, old ordinances, and old methods. Once they were buried, they were terminated.</p>
<p>However, this was not the end. In verse 11 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I...He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo; John buried people and terminated them, but the Lord Jesus, whom John introduced, would enliven the buried and terminated people so that they would be His followers. The way that John introduced the Lord Jesus was very crude and uncultured.</p>
<p>If John were to introduce Christ according to the Jewish religion, he would have convened a meeting with the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes. In the meeting he would say, &ldquo;The purpose of this meeting is to introduce Christ. Thank God that Christ is born. I am John, a priest, and I am here to introduce Christ.&rdquo; He would then ask Christ to go up to the platform, and continue, &ldquo;This is Jesus Christ. He was born in Bethlehem and grew up in Nazareth. Now I would ask all of you to come forward to shake hands with Him and congratulate Him.&rdquo; This is the religious way, but John did not introduce Christ in this way. Instead, he was by the river Jordan in the wilderness. The people that went to him repented and were buried one by one. John told them that he buried them, but Jesus Christ would come and baptize them in the Holy Spirit and fire so that they would be made alive. The Lord Jesus was introduced in a way that had no religious color, background, or atmosphere.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING OF CHRIST<br />
BEING OUTSIDE RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS</h2>
<p>Matthew 11:18-19 says, &ldquo;John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works.&rdquo; John had no taste for eating or drinking. Since the Lord was introduced by John, people thought that the Lord should not have a taste for eating or drinking. John did not eat or drink, but the Lord Jesus ate and drank. He was not according to the new religious thought. The Lord did not even eat and drink in an ordinary manner: He feasted in Matthew&rsquo;s home with tax collectors and sinners (9:9-10). This was intolerable to John&rsquo;s disciples. Is it right to eat and drink? Or is it right to not eat and drink? Hallelujah! There is no regulation. Is it right to be loud or remain quiet in the meetings? Both are right, and both are also wrong. Both right and wrong belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To be concerned with being right or wrong is to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The Lord does not care for being right or wrong. He cares only for the tree of life. To be loud is not right, and to remain quiet is also not right.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Wisdom is justified by her works&rdquo; (11:19). Wisdom is Christ (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). All that Christ did was according to the wisdom of God, which is Christ, and He was justified, vindicated, by His wise deeds and works. The King James Version uses <em>children</em> instead of <em>works</em> in Matthew 11:19 (cf. Luke 7:35). The New Testament believers are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom. We do not follow eating or not eating. We follow only Christ. If Christ is loud in us, we should be loud, and if He is quiet in us, we should be quiet.</p>
<p>The young saints like to be loud, but they must ask themselves whether Christ is the One who is loud in them. If they have the assurance that Christ is the One who is loud in them, it is right to be loud. My concern is that the Lord is not loud in them. The older saints should also ask themselves whether the Lord Jesus is quiet within them. If the Lord Jesus is quiet within them, then it is right to be quiet. It is not a matter of whether we should be loud or be quiet; it is a matter of having the Lord Jesus in us. It is not a matter of eating or not eating but a matter of having wisdom. Wisdom is the living Christ. We follow the living Christ however He leads us.</p>
