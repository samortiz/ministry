   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUB-SECTION TWO SMYRNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SUFFERING CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2:8-11 Verse Eight</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8: "And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen how the church had left her first love to the Lord Jesus during the age of Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, in the age of Smyrna, we see how God judged this degradation and how He severely rebuked her failure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no way for the fallen and unrepentant ones except chastening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is much better to be chastised by the Lord than to be forsaken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, God's chastisement is not for a few days as it seems good to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The Father of spirits" disciplines us "for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness" Heb 12:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's rod is always with a purpose, which is to bring us to a desired position.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church had lost her first love; this is too great a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The purpose of His chastisement was to cause His people to turn back to Him and to recover the freshness that was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times, what the voice of love cannot do, the chastening whip will do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many who have left the fountain of living waters will not turn back until they find out that their broken cisterns will no longer hold water Jer 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many prodigals will not remember the love of the father until they have met famine and have worked among the hogs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who are not the Lord's, will flee from His rod at first sight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who belong to Him will kiss the whip that chastises them after they have been disciplined by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When things are prosperous and smooth, there is always danger of losing the burning love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many saints have their love for the Lord stirred up at the time of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless a church that has fallen from her first love first passes through deep water and severe fire, it is difficult to preserve the freshness of her truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that these seven churches are consecutive, that they were raised up one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God saw that His church had lost her first position, He allowed Satan, who was always seeking for the opportunity, to persecute her so that through suffering she may learn to realize that God is her hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen how Ephesus had left the first love and had turned to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, how often has the world become a snare to the saints!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many have buried their love, testimony, zeal, and spirituality in this tomb of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God knows how to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fallen saint takes pleasure in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He follows after the world and draws his satisfaction from the people, events, and things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, God changes the world so that the Christians would realize that the world is not their settled abode.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the saints are not willing to forsake the world, God is forced to make the world bitter so that they would realize that the world is not their paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The world is now persecuting them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Will they still follow after it?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The world that they love has now turned around to oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can they love the people, events, and things in it any longer?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is right for a fallen church to live in a persecuting world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is also right for a worldly believer to live in an environment of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the meaning of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How many believers are there now who still love the world?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although they are manifested in different ways, their number is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this, God has no choice but to hand them over to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's original intention is that, through the cross of His Son, the saints would crucify the world on the cross, and they would pursue the things that are above and would leave behind the things of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But, as a result of the enticement of the beauty and glory of the world, the saints ignore the legitimate demand of the cross, and they join themselves with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, in the end God has to bring them through the great tribulation and has to persecute them through the hand that they love, so that they will realize the hypocrisy in man's face and in his heart, and will find out that the Savior is their only true friend and their rock.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This tribulation will be "such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" Matt 24:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, this tribulation is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Formerly, the Lord's love was not able to draw them away from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now, the world has become bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They find themselves stuck to it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They will want to leave the world behind as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They will begin to hate what they have formerly loved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will come to realize that "the whole world lies in the evil one" 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the world is not their place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They will realize that "the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever" 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Dear ones, do not love any person, event, or thing in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, you will find yourselves entangled by what you desire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The failure of the church is the motive behind the enemy's work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fall of the church is the handle by which the church opens the door to the attack of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once a church leaves its first love, God's safe-guarding hand that preserves it from Satan is relaxed, and the church will suffer Satan's persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The enemy's attack is often two-sided, from within and from without.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The results of the two are different.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His outward attack often fail for God has no reason to allow the power of Satan to overrun His people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, his inward deceptions are often beyond the discernment and defense of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only by putting on the whole armor of God can they stand firm in the evil days.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The roar of the lion surely causes the saints to fear and to fall into his carefully designed trap.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Though the enemy uses many tactics for attack, his goal is but one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, God uses these threats of the enemy to drive His people to the proper hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is often the result seen in the genuine and regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Smyrna is a suffering church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>While they were suffering, they may have considered the fiery trials a matter of surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But trials are not ominous.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What saddens the Lord the most is that believers would depart from these trials and would no longer suffer for the Lord or for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord desires that we be tried, but not because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every time the Lord chastises His people, it is for one of the following two reasons: He chastises us either because of our mistakes, or because we are about to commit a mistake and are not aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In his trials, David composed many sweet psalms, which, of course, were inspired by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These psalms are still in men's hearts and on their lips today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But as soon as David became prosperous, he fell into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The fear of trials and the craving for ease and comfort are signs of spiritual danger.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who may fail in trials may not yet have failed in ease, but this does not mean that they will not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We think that it is easier to live in ease, but without the difficult trials of fire, there are no difficult battles, and victory is relatively easy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, trials expose a man's true condition!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Actually, trials cause us to realize how God deals with us and how He works for us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sometimes, the trials are there to keep us from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God sees many dangers that we do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He uses many seemingly difficult things, which are actually not difficult at all, to avert the coming failures we face.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God's way of dealing with man has always been the granting of trials upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But it is a pity that failure seems to be man's allotted portion.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, God cannot sacrifice His glory.</S>
