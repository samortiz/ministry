   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE MANIFESTATION OF THE KINGDOM 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:27; 2 Cor 5:9-10; 1 Cor 4:5; 3:12-15; 9:24-27; 2 Tim 4:6-8; 1 Pet 5:4; Rev 22:12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the verses in the Scripture reading are related to three things: the second coming of the Lord Jesus, the manifestation of the kingdom, and the matter of receiving a reward or suffering a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians like to talk about the second coming of the Lord Jesus and also about the coming of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unfortunately, many times they talk about these things according to their concepts, not according to the pure Word in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While they may speak something concerning the second coming and also something concerning the kingdom, they seldom speak something concerning the saints receiving a reward or suffering a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If, however, we come back to the pure Word, we will see that the above verses are the development of Matthew 16:27.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 16 there is a little seed: "For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each man according to his doings."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From reading the pure Word in the Scriptures, we can see something of the Lord's revelation and also of His concept.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 16:27 does not say that, when the Son of Man comes in the glory of His Father, He will save everyone who believes in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it says He will reward each man according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not say according to his faith, but according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Justification is by faith, not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not saved by works, but by our faith Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 16:27 does not relate to the matter of salvation but to the matter of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid that many Christians do not have this word "reward" in their Christian dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be strongly impressed that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will reward every man according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE REWARD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reward is not a mansion in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Again, we must consider the pure Word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To the wise virgins the reward is the enjoyment of the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To the faithful servants the reward is the joy of the Lord and the ruling and authority over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you have the assurance that when the Lord Jesus comes, you will be rewarded?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may be so happy that the Lord Jesus is coming and that you are going to meet Him, but when you meet Him, will He reward you?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am fearful that when the Lord comes we will not be rewarded, but exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reward will be based upon our doings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How we live, walk, function, and work for the Lord after we are saved is the ground for the Lord to reward us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This concept is sown as a seed in Matthew 16:27.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us now read 2 Corinthians 5:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these verses the seed which was sown in Matthew 16 blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best translation of these verses is: "Wherefore we are ambitious, that, whether present or absent, we may be well-pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to be well-pleasing to the Lord, we must have an ambition to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not an ambition to go to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These verses do not mention a heavenly mansion, but rather the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not say that we will appear before the judgment seat to receive our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it says we will receive something according to the things done in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have done something good, we will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have done something bad, we will receive a kind of punishment.</S>
