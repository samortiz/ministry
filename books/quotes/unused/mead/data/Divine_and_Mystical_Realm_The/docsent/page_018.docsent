   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEFORE AND AFTER THAT DAY OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION A. Before That Day of Christ's Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before that day of Christ's resurrection, He had yet many things to unveil to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But His disciples could not bear them then John 16:12 because they had not received the Spirit of Christ's resurrection and had not entered into the divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. After That Day of Christ's Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus said that when the Spirit of reality came, He would guide the disciples, who would then be in the Spirit of Christ's resurrection, into all the reality concerning God's economy for the Body of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit of reality would speak what He heard of Christ and would declare to the disciples in the twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament from Romans to Revelation John 16:13 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All that the Father has is the Son's possession, embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. All That the Son Possesses Being Realized by the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All that the Son possesses is received by the Spirit, realized by the Spirit who became the life-giving Spirit in the resurrection of Christ for the realization of the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. The Spirit Receiving All That Christ Has and Declaring to the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit receives all that Christ has and declares to the disciples who were then in the reality of Christ's resurrection and in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ for the producing of the assemblies which issue in the Body of Christ that consummates the New Jerusalem to express the all-inclusive Christ for His glorification in eternity vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, all the things were the Father's. Then what the Father had became Christ's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following this, whatever Christ possesses is heard and received by the Spirit, who declares all these things to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the divine transition for the eternal economy of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>V. THE BELIEVERS BEING IN THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT FOR THE KEEPING OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the believers should be in this divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit to be mingled with the Triune God for the keeping of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. The Believers Abiding in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the believers should abide in the Son that the Son may abide in them that they may bear much fruit for the glorification expression of the Father 15:4-5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter fourteen the Lord prepared the places, the abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter fifteen we need to abide in Him as our abode that He may abide in us as His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. All the Believers Being One</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the believers should be one, even as the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, that they also may be in both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son is in the believers and the Father is in the Son, that the believers may be perfected into one 17:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our oneness must be the same as the oneness among the three of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the believers' oneness is the oneness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is in the Triune God that we can be perfected to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real oneness, therefore, is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 14 16 the Lord Jesus presented a message to His disciples, and then in John 17 He prayed to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His concluding prayer He indicated that our oneness should be in the Triune God, with the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This oneness, which is the genuine oneness, is the mingling of the believers with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To have such a oneness the believers must be in the Triune God as a divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the believers, and the believers are in the Son, who is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that the believers are one with the Triune God in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>VI.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO CONSIDER HIGHLY THE ENTRY INTO THIS REALM</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believers must consider highly the entry into this realm, realizing that without Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, without Christ being the pneumatic Christ, without Christ being the Lord Spirit, and without Christ being the Christ in resurrection and not only in the flesh, there is absolutely no way for the believers to participate in, experience, and enjoy the organic section of God's complete salvation in Christ.</S>
