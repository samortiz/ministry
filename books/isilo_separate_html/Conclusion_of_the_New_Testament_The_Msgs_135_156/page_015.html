Through the divine dispensing the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus. The peace of God is actually God Himself as peace (v. 9), infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer. This peace is the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33).<p>Bad news or difficult situations may cause us to worry or to be anxious. We find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the Father&#8217;s dispensing in His love. Then spontaneously, even unconsciously, the peace of God is transfused into our inner being. This transfused peace becomes the counterpoise of trouble and becomes the antidote to anxiety. From experience we know that through prayer we receive the antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us. Having the peace of God as the counterpoise to our troubles does not mean that the troubles will disappear. The troubles remain, but we have a counterpoise. Furthermore, the poison of anxiety is still within us, but we have an antidote-the peace of God transfused into our being through our fellowship with God in prayer. When we enjoy God as our peace, we are made calm within.<p>In Philippians 4:7 Paul says that the peace of God will guard our hearts and our thoughts in Christ Jesus. The Greek word rendered &#8220;guard&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;mount guard over.&#8221; The God of peace patrols or stands guard before our hearts and thoughts in Christ. The heart is the source, and the thoughts are the issue. The peace of God guards both our hearts and our thoughts. This means that in Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and our thoughts. The peace of God which patrols within our inner being in such a way keeps us calm and tranquil. Even though we may have many troubles and much anxiety, nothing will disturb us. From experience we know that the peace of God infused into us through His dispensing keeps us calm. This is truly an experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
