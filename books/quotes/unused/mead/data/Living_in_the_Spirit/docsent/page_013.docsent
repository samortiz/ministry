   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN THE SPIRIT BEING THE HIGHEST TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The highest teaching in the Scriptures is to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last few centuries this matter has never been released in such a clear way as it has been at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Pursuing holiness, pursuing victory, bearing the cross, and receiving the discipline of the Holy Spirit are all matters in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, these matters are all branches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The trunk, the foundation, is living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason we pursue holiness is because we do not live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would live in the spirit, it would be unnecessary to pursue holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason we try to be patient and victorious is because we do not live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would live in the spirit, pursuing patience and victory would be unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reason we need to be dealt with by the cross is because we live in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, if we would live in the spirit, there would be no need of dealing when we encounter the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dealing of the cross is for us to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we endeavor to be dealt with by the cross apart from the spirit, we are merely changing our understanding of a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, perhaps a brother has wronged us, lied about us, or offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At first we may be unable to get over it, but later we may think, "Now I realize that the Lord is dealing with me in this way to break me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am a stubborn old man, and no one can do anything about me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, God has given me such a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank the Lord, my understanding has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not blame that brother anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I understand that God is using that brother as an ax to break me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, Father, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would like to kiss the ax."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may have a change in understanding, but we still are not living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may endeavor to bear the cross three times in a day, but we still do not live in the spirit for even five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God does not want us to pursue holiness, victory, the cross, or breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God wants to be our life that we may live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that a great light would shine here to tear down all those other teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not need to learn this lesson or that lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need the spirit, and we need to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a sense, God does not need a person who has been broken or who has been polished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God needs a person who lives by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God does not need a person who lives by Him for five minutes and then stops living by Him after five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God needs people who will day and night, twenty-four hours a day, live in the spirit, live by Him, and live with Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why then does the Bible contain so many other teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The other teachings are tests to determine whether or not we are living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be mistaken into thinking that those teachings in the Bible are meant for us to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are there to prove whether or not we are living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Gospel of John does not teach us to be humble, to be patient, to bear the cross, or to learn this lesson or that lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The main emphasis of the Gospel of John can be found in three verses: "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" 6:57 ; "abide in Me and I in you" 15:4 ; and "if anyone loves Me, We will come to him and make an abode with him" 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can we live in Him, and how can He live in us?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only way was for Him to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 15 needs Romans 8 as its continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without Romans 8, it is not sufficiently clear how to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To abide in the Lord is to abide in the spirit, to set our mind on the spirit, and to walk closely according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we walk closely according to the spirit by setting our mind on the spirit, we abide in the spirit and also let the Lord abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not wait until trials come and then begin to pray, asking the Lord for endurance and strength in order to be able to receive the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that point it is too late to ask for help, and praying will not be of any help.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact that we turn to the Lord only when the trials come proves that we do not live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we were to live in the spirit, it would not matter whether we were experiencing trials, temptations, favor, pity, or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They would all be the same to us, because we would simply be living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No matter what kind of wind would blow on us whether our wife would lose her temper or a brother would argue with us we would not be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We would just live by our Lord and live in the spirit.</S>
