<h2 class="head2">The Church Being the Vessel<br />
to Fulfill God&rsquo;s Purpose and to Solve His Problems</h2>
<p>The church is the means and the vessel God uses today to fulfill His purpose and solve all His problems. The preaching in Christianity tells people, &ldquo;We are poor, sinful persons who will perish, so we need God&rsquo;s mercy and grace. God is merciful and full of grace to us, so He sent His Son to save us from hell. Now we are the beloved ones, and when God puts us together, we are the church.&rdquo; This is correct, but it is too poor and shallow. This is mainly what we heard concerning the church in the past. According to the revelation of the Word, however, the church is much deeper and higher than this. The church is the very vessel used by God to fulfill His purpose and to solve all His problems.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose and intention in creating the many human beings is to make these men a Body as a vessel to contain Him that He may dwell in them and manifest Himself through them by mingling Himself with them. This is God&rsquo;s purpose on the positive side. However, because one day Satan came in, God now has a problem, and He has an enemy. Then death followed Satan, and where death is, there is darkness. Following darkness there is confusion. If we had no light in this room, the whole room would be in confusion. Light is a controlling power. We are constantly, unconsciously controlled by light. If there were no light, we could still do things, but we would do them in confusion. Where there is light, however, we do things under the control of the light.</p>
<p>When Satan came in, he injected himself into the human race to affect and influence the whole creation. Then death came into the human race, and darkness and confusion followed. Now there is death, darkness, and confusion in the whole of creation. The entire creation is subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption. This corruption in the whole of creation came from darkness, darkness came from death, and death came from Satan. This is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. By this we can see that God has a purpose to fulfill, and He has an enemy and many problems&mdash;death, darkness, confusion, corruption, slavery, and vanity in His creation. Now God must do something for His creatures, because Satan has damaged them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Sonship Being Accomplished<br />
by Our Being Mingled with God<br />
unto Full Sanctification</h2>
<p>God is working Himself into us and mingling Himself with us so that we may be holy, absolutely sanctified by Him, in Him, and with Him. Every bit of our human nature will be mingled with the divine nature. In the Old Testament type, every part of the boards of the tabernacle was overlaid with gold. In the fulfillment of the type, God mingles Himself with the church so that we may be brought into full sonship.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the New Testament, sonship first means that we are born of God to have God as our life and nature. Second, it means that we grow up with God and in God, and third, it means that we are absolutely mingled with God; every part of our being will be permeated, saturated, overlaid, and absolutely mingled with God. Fourth, we are qualified to inherit all that God is, all that God has, and all that God has purposed. Fifth, we eventually are absolutely sanctified, holy, and divine. This is the proper meaning of sonship. Sonship implies a birthright, qualifying us to enjoy God by being mingled with Him. By being mingled with Him we are absolutely, thoroughly sanctified by Him, with Him, and in Him; within and without we are made holy and divine. God&rsquo;s purpose is to have the church sanctified to such an extent. This is the first item of God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO SUBDUE AND DEFEAT GOD&rsquo;S ENEMY<br />
BY DISPLAYING HIS MANIFOLD WISDOM<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The second aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is to subdue and defeat His enemy by displaying His multifarious wisdom through the church (Eph. 3:10-11). The more trouble the enemy causes, the more God will display His wisdom to him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO HEAD UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The third aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is that He will head up all things in Christ through the church. Although this aspect of the church in God&rsquo;s economy is revealed in the Word of God, many Christians have not seen it. For this reason, we need to study several verses concerning this matter. Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; <em>Economy,</em> or <em>dispensation,</em> and <em>the fullness of the times</em> are difficult phrases to understand and may seem strange to us. However, they help us to realize that what is spoken here is very important.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Center, the Hub, and the Head</h2>
<p>In the King James Version this verse says that &ldquo;He might gather together into one all things.&rdquo; This is better translated as &ldquo;to head up all things,&rdquo; as in Darby&rsquo;s New Translation. <em>Head up</em> in the Greek text is one word, not a phrase, the root of which is the word <em>head,</em> used as a verb. Without a head, the universe is in confusion. We are all headed up by our head. Because the head is upon the body, we may think that the body holds up the head. However, this is wrong. If we cut off the head, the body will fall. This proves that it is the head that holds up the body. To cut off the head brings confusion and death to the whole body.</p>
<p>All things are to be headed up in Christ. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is the center, the hub, to be the Head. If all things are put under His headship, then all things are headed up; that is, they are gathered together into one.</p>
