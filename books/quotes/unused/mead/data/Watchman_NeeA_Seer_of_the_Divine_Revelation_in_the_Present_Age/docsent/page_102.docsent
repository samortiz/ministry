   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIFT AND MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may illustrate the difference between gift and ministry by the example of Balaam's donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day the donkey of the Gentile prophet suddenly spoke with human language Num 22:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Could that be called ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A ministry is the expression of what we are, while a gift is merely a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you behold a man speaking, walking, and gesturing, you do not imagine that he is a horse or some other kind of animal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since he is a man, whatever he does is just the expression of that man; that is his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider monkeys for example.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes their trainers can entice them to perform like men, but that is entirely a gift or performance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In today's Christianity there is much acting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Much of it is performance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the apostle Paul were to visit us for one month, we would exclaim, "He is really what he ministers!"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What he has seen has been wrought into his being; hence, what he ministers is what he is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The person is the message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we have those who are eloquent and learned, those who have degrees after their names, those who dress in a certain way, stand upon a platform, and with a certain tone deliver a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is merely a performance; it is not the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle Paul was different, and Watchman Nee was also different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was with Watchman Nee for years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He talked about the cross, and in him I saw the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a person of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sufferings he received from all directions were just the working of the cross, and the revelation he received concerning the cross was wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What he did in years past was not merely to teach or exercise a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I can testify from the depths of my being that what he did was a ministry; what he did was what he was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the building up of the churches, gifts are not as necessary as ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What Watchman Nee had was not merely a gift, but a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had seen something of God and these things were burned into him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even his presence ministered life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His presence always meant a great deal in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he was there, the meeting was rich; if he was absent, the meeting was not so rich.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His presence, even his silent presence, made a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had a real ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not his knowledge, his doctrine, nor his gift, but something of God wrought into his being so that his very presence in the meeting made a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes when the troubled saints brought their problems into his presence, there was no need for him to say a word; their problems were solved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In his presence they received the light they needed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His presence became their enlightenment, for God's light had been wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They saw light in his light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How much we need such a ministry in the church today!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Throughout the years that I was with Watchman Nee, I noticed how he continually belittled gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What he stressed over and over again was the need for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two Epistles in the Bible written by the apostle Paul to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The main topic in the first Epistle is "gifts," and it is mentioned negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the second Epistle the main word is "ministry," and it is mentioned in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the first Epistle Paul depreciated the gifts, and in the second Epistle he uplifted the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the second Epistle it is difficult to find the word "gift," but in the first Epistle it appears many times.</S>
