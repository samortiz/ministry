In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Galatians
Paul wrote this Epistle not only for the sake of the churches in Galatia but also for the sake of the truth of the gospel
Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age
Apart from the crucifixion of Christ we have no way to deal with sins behind which the devil hides or the evil age behind which Satan hides
Literally, the Greek word translated rescue in Galatians 1:4 means 'to pluck out of, to draw out of, or to extricate from'
The fold is religion, whereas the flock is the one universal church, the one Body of Christ, consisting of all the believers in Christ
Today Christ is seeking to rescue His sheep out of the various religious folds and to bring them together as the one flock
In His economy God planned that Christ would rescue His chosen people out of Judaism, the law, traditions, and rituals
In Paul's day Satan used Judaism to systematize all Pharisees, scribes, priests, and elders among the Jewish people
Today Satan uses the religion of Christianity to systematize many of the Lord's people away from God's will, the organic Body of Christ
On the one hand, Christ gave Himself for our sins on the cross that He might rescue us out of the Jewish religion
As believers in Christ, we should enjoy Him as our pasture for us to feed on and receive nourishment for growth
By feeding on the pasture, the sheep will enjoy the abundant life supply, for the Lord Jesus is their abundant life
In our daily Christian life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life
According to John 10 Christ came as the good Shepherd to enter into the fold, which signifies the Jewish religion with the law
The Jewish religion, as a fold, was sed as a shelter to keep God's people in the custody of the law for Christ
The apostle Paul was charged by the Lord to lead God's people out of the fold of religion into Christ as the living pasture
Although Paul was sent to preach the gospel in the Gentile lands, when he visited Gentile cities, he often went to the synagogues
When Christ met him there, he saw Christ, was captured by the appearing of Christ, and became Paul the apostle
Years after his conversion, the apostle declared in Galatians 1:15-16 that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him
Paul did not say that Christ revealed Himself to him but that the Father in His pleasure revealed Christ into Paul
In 1:11-12 Paul says, 'I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man
The revelation of Christ does not refer merely to a revelation received through Jesus Christ or to the revelation concerning Christ
The gospel that the apostle received through the revelation of Christ is the center of God's revelation in the New Testament
Christ was crucified to redeem us out of the curse of the law and rescue us out of the present evil religious course of the world
God's heart's desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life , and become the sons of God
The Judaizers had bewitched the Galatians into considering that the ordinances of the law were above the Son of the living God
At the time appointed by God, when Saul, zealous in his religion, was persecuting the church, the Son of God was revealed to him
God could bear with Saul's zeal for the traditions of his fathers, for this produced a dark background against which to reveal Christ
Of focusing his attention on this living person, man has a natural tendency to direct his attention to religion with its tradition
The record of the experience of the disciples with the Lord Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration illustrates this
Although it is doubtful that Moses and Elijah were in glory, they nonetheless were speaking with the glorified Jesus
He was heir of the centuries-old tradition concerning Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets
It is significant that in Galatians 1:15 and 16 Paul does not say that God revealed Christ in him but that God revealed His Son in him
The reason for this difference is that whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit
One day through incarnation the Son of God became a man called the last Adam who through death and resurrection became the lifegiving Spirit
Although this living person is so all-inclusive, He is very practical to us, for, as the life-giving Spirit, He is in our regenerated spirit
On the one hand, He is in the heavens as the Lord, the Christ, the King, the Head, the High Priest, and the heavenly Minister
From the time this living person was revealed in Saul, the veil was taken away and Saul was enlightened concerning the Son of God
We need to pray that we may see such a vision of the living person of the Son of God and care for Him more than anything else
Without this living person as the reality and content of the church life, even the church life will become a tradition
We should not treasure anything, including our Bible knowledge or spiritual experience and attainments, in place of this living person
As the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, He is within us to be whatever we need
From the beginning of the Bible to the end, especially in the New Testament, Christ occupies the central place
If we drop our concepts and turn our heart to the Lord the veils will be taken away and the god of this age will have no ground in our being
Because the mind plays an important part, it is crucial that we drop our concepts, all of which are in the mind
If we hold on to the concepts in our mind, the revelation may be in our spirit, but it will not be able to penetrate our veiled mentality
The more we turn our heart to the Lord, the less ground the god of this age will have in our life and in our being
We will be under the shining of the heavenly light, and we will receive the revelation of the living person of the Son of God
In order to receive the revelation of the Son of God, we must take care of the depths of our being, that is, our spirit
God's plan is to reveal Christ into us, to make Christ our life and everything, and to regenerate and transform us to be members of Christ
God made the apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him , and revealing His Son in him
Since the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, God's unveiling of Christ should continue in us; this unveiling should never cease
The more He lives in us, the more He will become to us the unique and central blessing of the gospel which God promised to Abraham
The book of Galatians eventually brings us to the new creation by way of the inward revelation of the living person of the Son of God
From the time he first met the Lord on his way to Damascus, God's revelation of Christ began to shine within Paul
He received not only a revelation of Christ but also a burden to preach, to minister, and to present this One to others
The proper preaching of the gospel is not the preaching of a doctrine; it is the preaching of the person of the Son of God
No matter what the subject of our gospel message may be, the focal point of our preaching must be this living person
The Lord said to Saul that He would reveal other things to him, not in the way of mere teaching but by means of His appearing
His appearing will make us witnesses; we will tell others of what we have seen in the presence of the living Lord
After we have seen the vision, we need to contact others, telling them that Christ has appeared to us and that we have seen Him
The Judaizers were slaves under law; they did not realize how much they were suffering under the slavery of law
Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law, its ordinances, practices, and regulations
Anyone who tries to keep the law makes himself a debtor to the ordinances, practices, and regulations of the law
If we try to keep the law we will come under the yoke of the law place ourselves under the slavery of the law and serve the law as a slave
Proper freedom is not only liberation from obligation; it is also full satisfaction because of an adequate supply
If we strive to keep the law, we will not have true rest because our efforts to keep the law place us under a heavy burden
It refers in particular to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations
Satan, the subtle one, sent in the Judaizers to spy out this freedom and to deprive the Galatian believers of this treasure
He wanted to take away their liberation from obligation, their satisfaction, their rest, and their enjoyment of Christ
For this reason, they do not participate in God's promise and have no enjoyment of life in grace by the Spirit
As we consider the matter of freedom in Christ, we need to see that Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life by grace
Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life into us by the Triune God who has been processed to become our enjoyment
The more we describe Him and speak of His preciousness, the more something will be infused into the being of the listeners
In order to be justified by faith in Christ, we need to believe in the Lord Jesus out of an appreciation of His preciousness
As Christ's preciousness is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, we spontaneously appreciate the Lord and call on Him
The organic union with Christ is accomplished spontaneously through the living faith produced by our appreciation of Him
In Galatians 2:20 Christ is presented as the One who has given Himself up for the believers and who lives in them
When we truly see this fact, we will not do anything by ourselves, for a dead person can neither do good nor have any hope
God's economy is to terminate us and put us into the tomb so that we may receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God
It is crucial to see that we have been crucified and that it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us
On the one hand Paul had been terminated but on the other hand a resurrected Paul one who was regenerated with God as his life still lived
Although Paul said No longer I he also said It is Christ who lives in me for it was Christ who lived but it was in Paul that He lived
To keep the law is to exalt it above all things in our life; to live Christ is to make Him the center and everything in our life
As the ascended Lord, He is sitting in the heavens at the right hand of God, and as the life-giving Spirit, He lives within us
Now that He dwells in us as the Spirit, we need to learn how to let Him live in us and how to live together with Him
Sooner or later, those who seek the Lord realize that Someone divine, heavenly, eternal, and spiritual lives in them as a person
What God desires is to gain a group of people who live by Christ that they may be the corporate expression of Christ
Day by day we need to take Him as our life within so that we may be His living without for His corporate expression
The life which we now live in the flesh is not bios, the physical life, or psuche, the soulish life, but zoe, the spiritual and divine life
In contrast to the way we live the physical and soulish life, we live the divine life not by sight or by feeling
According to our Christian experience, the genuine living faith which operates in us is not only of Christ but also in Christ
Faith is related not only to the Christ who has been infused into us but also to the Christ who is continually infusing Himself into us
Otherwise, at the end of such a long verse there would have been no need for him to speak of Christ loving him and giving Himself up for him
As we consider these verses, we can see that Paul's faith came from an appreciation of the constraining love of Christ
In summary, God's economy is not that we try to keep the law in the strength of our flesh; His economy is to work Himself into us
God's New Testament economy is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into us to become our life and our being
If we see this, we will be able to proclaim that we have been crucified with Christ and that we live no longer
Now we live by faith in the Son of God and of the Son of God, a faith that produces an organic union in which we and Christ are one
In His economy God's intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new 'I'
The old person, the old 'I,' the 'I' without God, is over, but the new person, the new 'I,' the 'I' with the Triune God in it, still lives
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ'
As we will see in this message, Galatians 3:14 indicates that the blessing is the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God
Since Christ is now the Spirit He is not only the seed who inherits the promises but also the blessing of the promises to be inherited by us
God's blessing of Abraham eventually issued in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth are blessed
All the believers in Christ, as members of the corporate Christ , are included in this seed as the heirs of God's promised blessing
As the seed of Abraham, Christ in His humanity was crucified and became a curse on our behalf to redeem us out of the curse of the law
Through his fall, Adam brought us all under the curse; as fallen descendants of Adam, we the sinners were under the curse
Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law
Since thorns are a sign of the curse, Christ's wearing a crown of thorns indicates that He took our curse on the cross
Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law
Not only so, since man did not know that he was totally fallen, incurable, and hopeless, he tried to please God by his own effort
God came in, called Abraham, and promised that in his seed, all the nations-mankind under a curse-would be blessed
The children of Israel, being fallen in nature, surely did not measure up to the law; thus, they were cursed under the law
Through His incarnation Christ came as the seed of Abraham, and through His crucifixion Christ died on the cross to be a curse on our behalf
The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
In Galatians 3:14 the blessing of the promise is the Spirit, and in verse 16 the promises were made to Abraham's seed, who is Christ
Our blessing is God Himself, who is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment
Our spiritual blessing for eternity is to inherit the Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as our inheritance
The all-inclusive compound Spirit is typified by the holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices in Exodus 30
The four spices-myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia-were compounded with the oil to become a compound ointment
In typology oil signifies the Spirit of God, and the compound ointment, the oil blended with four spices, signifies the compound Spirit
Before Exodus 30 this compound was 'not yet,' but after Exodus 30 such an ointment was definitely in existence
Before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was not yet
Fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ
On the cross He was dying not merely as the Son of God in the human flesh; rather, the entire Triune God was involved in His crucifixion
For this reason, Acts 20:28 tells us that God obtained the church with His own blood, that is, with the blood of His Son, Jesus Christ
On the one hand, as a man, He was raised by God from the dead ; on the other hand, as God Himself, He rose from the dead
According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, in His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life
That Christ is the life-giving Spirit is confirmed by 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
The Triune God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit-has passed through processes to be consummated in the Spirit
We should praise the Lord that we have received the Spirit as such a blessing and may enjoy Him all the time through eternity
If Christ had not come as the seed of Abraham, there would have been no way for God to fulfill His promise to Abraham
Christ as the seed of Abraham has redeemed us out of the curse of the law so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Him
The blessing promised to Abraham comes to us through Christ's redemption; now in Christ all the nations will be blessed
As the seed of Abraham, Christ brought to us the processed and consummated Triune God as our blessing for our enjoyment
Paul says in verses 24 and 25, 'So then the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ that we might be justified out of faith
Child-conductor means 'an escort, guardian, or custodian, one who cares for a child who is under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster'
In ancient times the children of wealthy Jewish families were escorted to their schoolmaster by a custodian, a child-conductor
The law was responsible for the care and protection of God's chosen people, and eventually it brought them to Christ
The law functioned as a custodian to bring the sinning Israelite to Christ, his Redeemer, typified by the trespass offering
If it had not been for the law, not many of the children of Israel would have come to the altar with a trespass offering
Because the law exposed them and condemned them, they realized their need to come to the altar with the required offering
Now under the new testament, they are considered sons of full age, who will inherit the promised blessing-the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ
The impartation of the divine life into us causes an organic union, which makes us both the sons of God and the sons of Abraham
Our true status is that in Christ and by the organic union with the Triune God, we are both sons of God and sons of Abraham
By both faith and baptism we have entered into Christ, having thus put on Christ and become identified with Christ
Because there is only one seed of Abraham, Christ, we are all baptized into Christ to become one new man in Christ
In Galatians 3:29 Paul continues, 'And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise'
Under the new testament the believers as God's chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ
After we have believed into Christ, we should have nothing to do with the law; we should only remain in Christ, abiding in Him
All the believers in Christ, as the members of the corporate Christ, are included in this seed as the heirs of God's promised blessing
Eventually, the eternal New Jerusalem, the great, corporate Christ, will be the ultimate consummation of the seed of Abraham
For the accomplishment of redemption Christ was crucified alone but for terminating the old creation Christ included us in His crucifixion
In the same principle, in the fulfillment of the promise made by God to Abraham, we are not included as part of the unique seed
We, the New Testament believers, were born sons of fallen Adam, and in Adam, because of transgressions, we were under the law of Moses
We have been reborn to become the sons of Abraham and have been freed from the law of Moses by faith in Christ
As previously mentioned, Galatians 3:7 and 29 tell us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham
We the believers who are sons of Abraham through faith are the heirs of the promise, those who inherit the blessing
If we are the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything other than Christ and live by faith, not by our works
Although we all have a natural life with a natural ancestry, we need not live any longer according to that life
At the appointed time Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill the promise and bring in the promised blessing
On our side, we need a way to apprehend, realize, and enjoy all that Christ, the seed, is and has accomplished
Now since we have grace, faith, and the seed that has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian
In Galatians 4:4 Paul says, 'When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law'
The fullness of the time refers to the completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed by the Father
Christ was born under law, as revealed in Luke 2:21-24 and 27, and He kept the law, as revealed in the four Gospels
For the accomplishment of redemption, it was necessary for the Son of God to become a human being born of a woman and born under the law
God's economy is to make us sons of God, who inherit the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose
In Galatians 46 Paul goes on to say And because you are sons God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying Abba Father!
He also sent forth God the Spirit, the Spirit of life , to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality
If the Spirit had not come, our sonship would have been a sonship in position or form, not a sonship with reality
In crucifixion for our redemption, this One was Christ, but in the indwelling to be our life, He is the Spirit
After He had finished this work, He became, in resurrection, the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son
He sent the Spirit to vitalize the sonship and to make it real in our experience, that is, to bring us into its reality
The parallel verse, Romans 8:15, says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, 'Abba, Father'!
The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
Since the spirit is in the heart , it is not possible for the Spirit to be sent into our spirit without also being sent into our heart
The inner sense we have as we call on the Lord from our spirit through our heart is mainly in the heart, not in the spirit
In Galatians 4:7 Paul continues, 'So then you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God'
Whereas the law could not give life, the Spirit gives life and brings us into maturity that we may have the full position and right of sons
Paul considered himself the begetting father and the Galatian believers his children begotten of him in Christ
Because they deviated from the gospel that he had preached to them, he was toiling again in travail until Christ would be formed in them
In order to have Christ formed in us, we need to drop everything other than Christ Himself, no matter how good these things may be
Although the law was given by God, it must be set aside so that all the ground in our being may be given over to Christ
To let Christ make His home in our hearts means to allow Him to make His home in all these parts of our inner being
He should not only spread into our mind, emotion, and will; He should actually become our mind, emotion, and will
Romans 12:2a says, 'Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Our mind is the leading part of our soul, and as it is renewed, our will and emotion are automatically renewed
At times we may think noble thoughts, but frequently in our daily life our mind may express the self with the world
We may love, laugh, and weep by the self, rather than by Christ; this indicates that Christ has not been formed in our emotion
We can never be an expression of Christ until He saturates our entire inner being, replacing the self and the world in our soul with Himself
According to Paul's usage in the New Testament, the word form refers to the outward expression of the inner being
If we are full of the self and love the world in our inner being, our outward form will be the self and the world
Paul had to suffer like a mother, travailing for the Galatians until Christ would replace the self and the world in them with Himself
He should occupy our thinking, our consideration, our love, our hatred, our happiness, our sorrow, and our intention
As Christ increasingly saturates our soul, eventually He will invade our body, dispensing Himself into our entire being
The book of Galatians reveals that God's intention is for Christ to be wrought into His chosen people that they may become sons of God
As believers in Christ, we need the full enjoyment of this blessing, the full enjoyment of the life-giving Spirit
Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom in grace
We should stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of the law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace
Paul is telling the Galatians that they must set aside the yoke of slavery and return to their freedom in Christ
As the Emancipator who delivers us from the slavery of the law Christ brings us into grace by the Spirit and by faith operating through love
In order to have the proper enjoyment of Christ we need to have the Spirit as the allinclusive land and faith as the means to enjoy the land
The way of faith causes the organic union between the processed God and regenerated man to be developed and cultivated
The Spirit is the all-inclusive land for our enjoyment, and faith is the organ by which we participate in this rich land and enjoy it
The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality
Circumcision is a type of the cross of Christ; it typifies the cutting off of the flesh that is accomplished by the cross
While Paul encourages the believers to enjoy their freedom in Christ, he is also concerned that they may misuse or abuse this freedom
Of turning freedom into an occasion for the flesh, we should be limited in the use of freedom and be willing to serve one another as slaves
As Paul says in 5:14, 'The whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself'
We may enjoy the freedom we have yet still be restricted in love for the sake of others that the church life may go on in a good way
Christ has set us free from the slavery of the law that we might walk by the Spirit, not fulfilling the lust of the flesh
If we try to keep the law, attempting to do good in order to please God, we will be in the flesh, for the law is related to the flesh
The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man , and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God
The Spirit of life, not the law of letters, is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit
If we walk by the Spirit, automatically we will no longer be under the law, for the Spirit will lead us away from the law of letters
The processed Triune God who lives in us as the life-giving Spirit should be the essence of our new being and the path for our way
Walking by the Spirit as our way, we will be able to reach the goal and gain the prize, which is Christ Himself
In Galatians 5:24 Paul says, 'They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
The expression they who are of Christ Jesus refers to those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Him
Based upon the fact that Christ has crucified our old man and the 'I,' we who are of Christ Jesus 'have crucified' the flesh
Paul's use of the perfect tense to describe this in Galatians 5:24 indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers
Through His cross, Christ crucified not only the flesh but also the religious world with its rituals, including circumcision
On the one hand, the religious world was crucified to us; on the other hand, we were crucified to the religious world
The old creation is our old man in Adam , our natural being by birth, without God's life and the divine nature
The old creation was old because it did not have God's element; the new creation is new because it has God as its element
Although we are still the old creation, we experience the reality of the new creation when we walk according to the Spirit
Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation with Christ as its life is what matters
The keeping of the law and the practicing of circumcision are a sowing unto the flesh; they do not change the old creation
We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world
For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh
The expression in the flesh in verse 12 means outwardly in the sphere of the flesh, which is condemned and repudiated by God
The grace of Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Triune God enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit
We need the grace of the Lord, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit , to be with our spirit
If we do not know our human spirit which has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit we have no way to enjoy Christ as the allinclusive Spirit
Christ the Spirit the new creation and our spirit are the four basic items revealed in Galatians as the underlying thought of Gods economy
In Galatians 6:16 Paul says, 'As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
Walking by the principle of the new creation is mysterious because it is an organic matter altogether related to life
If we would live the new creation, we must do everything in oneness with the Triune God, and the element of God must be wrought into us
To live the new creation is to live, walk, have our being, and do all things, great or small, with the element of God
In all that we do, we should act not in ourselves but according to our regenerated spirit filled with the divine element
The meaning of the new creation is that God, the divine Spirit, mingles Himself with us and constitutes us with Himself to make us new
As a result, we no longer remain the old creation but become a new creation with a divine element wrought into us
Just as a slave might bear a brand mark testifying that he belonged to a certain owner, Paul bore in his body the brands of Jesus
It was as if the name of Christ had been branded upon him again and again as a testimony and declaration that Paul belonged to the Lord
With Paul, a slave of Christ , the brands were physically the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master
Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life that he lived, a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on this earth
As previously mentioned, the spiritual significance of the expression the brands of Jesus is that Paul lived a crucified life
As we read the four Gospels, we see the portrait of a man constantly living a crucified life; this kind of life is a brand
As one who lived in the fellowship of Jesus' sufferings, Paul bore the brands of Jesus as the sign that he lived a crucified life
Because he was persecuted, despised, ridiculed, rejected, and condemned, he could truly say that he bore the brands of Jesus
We should be those who bear such a brand of Jesus, leaving any kind of religion and living a life absolutely in Christ
In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ unveiled in Ephesians
In Ephesians 1:3-14 we see that Christ is the sphere and the means of the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies
These blessings are from the heavens having a heavenly nature heavenly state heavenly characteristic heavenly taste and heavenly atmosphere
The believers in Christ are enjoying on earth these heavenly blessings, which are spiritual as well as heavenly
The blessings bestowed on us are of God the Father, in God the Son, through God the Spirit, and in the heavenlies
The word blessing in 1:3 literally means 'good speech, or, utterance, well speaking, or fair speech; implying bounty and benefit'
In 1:4 Paul says, 'Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love'
God selected us not in ourselves in our situation or in our sphere but in Christ as the means the sphere the condition and the circumstance
Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common
He makes us holy by imparting Himself the Holy One into our being that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature
For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of God's divine nature and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose, which is to determine a destiny beforehand
God's predestinating us unto sonship is for the praise of His expression in His grace, that is, for the praise of the glory of His grace
Grace is God Himself as our enjoyment, glory is God manifested, and the glory of God's grace is God expressed in our enjoyment of Him
As previously mentioned, verse 6 reveals that we have become the object of God's favor, for we have been graced in the Beloved
Redemption is what Christ accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is the application of Christ's accomplishment to our offenses
The economy that God according to His desire planned and purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times
Altogether there are four ages: the age of sin , the age of the law , the age of grace , and the age of the kingdom
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth
Without the church as the Body to match Christ as the Head, it will not be possible for God to head up all things in Christ
The heading up of all things is accomplished by the Head, but it cannot be accomplished without a Body for the Head
When everything is headed up in Christ, there will be absolute peace and harmony , a full rescue out of the collapse
When God created the universe, everything of the universe was in oneness; all things in it were in harmony, not in chaos
In other words, when Satan brought death into the universe, the universe was separated from God and the oneness of the universe was lost
God had an eternal plan to head up all things in Christ, that is, to make Christ the Head of all things and the Head above all things
The more we grow in life, the more we will be headed up and the more we will be rescued from the universal collapse
In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city
The phrase in whom refers to the heading-up Christ revealed in verse 10, indicating that we have been placed into the heading-up Christ
We were fallen in Adam, but through His redemption Christ brought us out of Adam into Himself as the sphere and the element
The Greek words rendered 'were designated as an inheritance' can also be translated 'have obtained an inheritance'
We have a marvelous mutual inheritance we have become Gods inheritance for Gods enjoyment and God will be our inheritance for our enjoyment
We have already been placed in the heading-up Christ, but we are still in the process of being made God's inheritance in full
In this process the natural life must be eliminated, and the divine nature must increase by being wrought into more of our being
In Ephesians 1:12 Paul speaks of the all-inclusive hope in Christ: 'We would be to the praise of His glory who have first hoped in Christ'
In 1:13-14 Paul speaks of another spiritual blessing we have in Christ: the Holy Spirit's sealing and pledging
At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God
We have been sealed with the sealing Spirit who saturates us, permeates us, and is mingled with us, making Him and us one constitution
Some believers do not have a very large appetite for Christ, because they do not care for the pledging of the Spirit
The more we taste of the Lord, the greater is our appetite for Him, and the more appetite we have, the more we taste Him
The Holy Spirit's sealing indicates that we are God's inheritance, whereas His pledging in us indicates that God will be our inheritance
The Holy Spirit is the seal of God, a mark placed on us to indicate that we are God's possession and God's inheritance, belonging to God
At the same time, the Holy Spirit is the pledge in us to guarantee to us that God is our possession and our inheritance
The Holy Spirit's sealing and pledging have begun, are continuing, and will continue to go on in us until the redemption of our body
Every day the Holy Spirit is sealing us increasingly making us Gods inheritance He is pledging in us gradually making God our inheritance
Redemption in verse 14 refers to the redemption of our body , that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious body
May we all learn to experience and enjoy Christ as the sphere and the means of all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies
We the believers are active and aggressive because we have God as the divine power motivating us and strengthening us
Within this power, therefore, there is the power of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
When death comes to visit us, we cannot refuse it, for death has power to hold us, but it did not have the power to hold Christ
Although death did everything to hold Him, after visiting the realm of the dead for three days, Christ came forth in resurrection
In order to experience God's resurrection power, we must not tolerate death within us and must have a strong desire to reject death
Conversely, if we hate death and are desperate to be delivered from death, the resurrection power within us will be manifested
Gods right hand where Christ was seated by the surpassingly great power of God is the most honorable place the place with supreme authority
In verse 21 Paul says that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named
The ascended Christ was seated by the great power of God far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe
All the negative things on the earth create a poor environment, but we are sitting in the third heaven looking down at them all
As a result although others may oppose us or bother us we will sit together with Christ in the heavenlies and thereby be transcendent in Him
If we experience God's transcending power in all our circumstances, the proper church life as the Body of Christ will be manifested
In order to experience the subjecting power, we need to pray, 'Lord, all things have been subjected under Your feet
We need to experience the subjecting power to live such a subduing life; then all things will be under our feet
There are four aspects of the power that operated in Christ: resurrection power , ascending power , subjecting power , and heading-up power
We need to not only believe God's speaking regarding the power but also echo this again and again by speaking it continually
Eventually, through our faith in this transmission and through our speaking it forth, the church will come forth in a practical way
When we open ourselves to the Lord, this power functions to saturate us with the divine essence transmitted into us from the heavens
If we would experience a continual transmission, we need to repent, confess, and make a clearance of all hindrances
The Body of Christ is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, who has come into the church
By means of the ascended Christ's heavenly transmission, we are made one with Him, and thus His Body is produced
On the day of Pentecost all that Christ had passed through, obtained, and attained was transmitted from the third heaven to the church
On the one hand, the phrase all in all in Ephesians 1:23 is similar to the phrase all and in all in Colossians 3:11
In Ephesians 1, the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who is in all the believers and who is all the believers
Christ is the One who fills all the believers and is in all the believers, and the Body of Christ is the issue of such a filling
On the other hand, Christ's filling all in all in Ephesians 1:23 surpasses His being all and in all in Colossians 3:11
Christ is not only all and in all with respect to the new man, but He fills all in all with respect to the universe
He descended into the lower parts of the earth, rose from the dead, and ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things
Ephesians 2:5-10 reveals that Christ is the sphere and element of the creation of God's masterpiece, the believers as a corporate entity
Without Christ and outside of Christ, God has no way to enliven us, raise us up, and seat us in the heavenlies
As sinners, we need God's forgiveness and justification, but as those who are dead in offenses and sins , we need to be made alive
God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself , into our dead spirit through His Spirit of life
Grace is free; here it denotes not only God freely dispensed into us for our enjoyment but also God's action in freely saving us
Verse 6 tells us that God 'raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
By this salvation God not only made us alive together with Christ but also raised us up together with Christ and seated us together with Him
In God's view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea
God not only raised us up from the position of death, but He also seated us in the highest place in the universe
In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into a position in which we are above all God's enemies
Although we are persons living and moving on the earth we should see ourselves seated together with Christ in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus
Since we are in the heavenlies in Christ, we are not under any person or problem; rather, we are far above all persons and problems
We are transcendent because we are people in the heavenlies in the organic union with Christ through His resurrection and ascension
The church is produced in the present age; the ages which are coming are the ages of the millennium and eternity future
In verse 8 Paul continues, 'For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God'
According to this Epistle, salvation is the transmission of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us
Once we receive such a divine transmission, we are made alive, raised up, and seated with Christ in the heavenlies
In the ages to come-in the millennium and eternity future-God will display this grace publicly to the whole universe
Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design
In the eyes of the angels and even in the eyes of Satan, we are a sweet, beautiful, and wise poem written by God
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, a new invention of God
When we see the New Jerusalem, we may extol God for the beauty, wisdom, and design manifested in this marvelous production
In Ephesians 2:10 Paul goes on to say, 'For good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them'
In Christ we have been saved by grace to be God's masterpiece that we may walk in the good works prepared beforehand by God
In this way God in His grace has worked on us to make us the divine, heavenly, and universal poem, God's masterpiece created in Christ Jesus
It caused man's body to become the flesh, full of lusts, and eventually, it made the whole being of man the flesh
Christ, in whom all God's blessings to His chosen people are embodied, came out of Israel, the circumcised people
Since we, the uncircumcised Gentiles, were separated from Israel, we were apart from Christ, having nothing to do with Christ
Commonwealth here refers to the citizenship, the civil rights, of God's chosen people, such as God's ruling, blessing, and presence
God is in Christ, He rules and moves in the commonwealth of Israel, and He bestows His blessings according to His covenants
Ephesians 2:13 goes on to say, 'But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ'
When He was crucified, He brought all the ordinances to the cross; on the cross all these ordinances were crucified
Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances
The middle wall of partition is the law of the commandments in ordinances, which was instituted because of man's flesh
The worldly people regard cultural differences as a mark of prestige, but in Christ we have all lost this prestige
If we are willing to let go of our cultural pride, it will be possible for the Lord to have the proper church life
It was in His flesh that we, the old man, were terminated, but it is in the wonderful Spirit that we have been created into the one new man
Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man the church but also the sphere in which and the means by which the one new man was created
In the creating of the one new man, however, God's nature was wrought into man to make His divine nature one entity with humanity
The church is not only the church of God the Body of Christ and the household or family the house the temple and the dwelling place of God
Because of the fall of mankind and the calling of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
As the Creator of the new man, Christ has reconciled the Jews and the Gentiles in one Body to God in one Spirit
We, the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ but also in the Body of Christ
Not Christ but the apostles and prophets who received the revelation concerning Christ are stressed as the foundation
Verse 42 says, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner
By this word the Lord revealed that after His resurrection He would become the cornerstone to join the Jews and the Gentiles
There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined together in Christ for God's building
By His all-inclusive and wonderful death, Christ created both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man
Because Christ has abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, and because we all have the divine life, we are one
According to verse 5, Christ as the mystery of the church was hidden in other generations but has been revealed in the New Testament age
God's economy, which is to dispense Himself into man in order to produce a Body for His Son, had not been revealed to them
God's economy is to dispense Himself into a great number of human beings in order to produce a Body for this embodiment of Himself
The apostles are the ones sent by Christ, representing Him to carry out His commission in God's New Testament economy
The word spirit here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God
It is important to see that the hidden mystery is revealed to the apostles and prophets, not in their mind but in their mingled spirit
To see and to understand the mystery of Christ, our human mentality apart from our mingled spirit is altogether inadequate
If we remain in our mind, we will be unable to see God's revelation, but if we turn to our spirit, we will have the vision of God's mystery
We need to open our being, be poor in spirit, and pray that the Lord would reveal to our spirit what is on His heart concerning the church
If we have the revelation of God's economy, we will be followers of the apostles and prophets in God's New Testament ministry
In Ephesians 3 Paul tells us that the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ for the church has been given to the apostles and prophets
The fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment
According to verse 10, it is through the church that God's multifarious wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies
Before we were saved, we were dead in trespasses and sins, and we were scattered and divided, utterly unable to be one
Now we are not only redeemed, saved, cleansed, freed, liberated, and regenerated-we are one with God and with one another
At the time of man's fall, Satan as sin entered into man and, in many respects, caused man to be the same as he is
Satan instigated Judas to betray the Lord Jesus, and then he stirred up the Jews and the Gentiles to cooperate in crucifying Him
What Satan did not realize, however, was that in putting this One on the cross, he was actually crucifying himself
Because man was poisoned by Satan and corrupted by sin, God not only redeemed man but also regenerated him with His life
Now God is working continually to sanctify His regenerated people with His holy nature and to transform them with His element
The divine life is for regeneration, the holy nature is for sanctification, and the divine element is for transformation
No human words can tell the greatness of Gods wisdom in redemption regeneration sanctification transformation conformation and glorification
According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is our wisdom with respect to righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Many aspects of God's wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Only God has the wisdom to initiate such a wonderful thing, to make sinful and corrupted people the members of Christ
The eternal purpose is the purpose of eternity, the purpose of the ages, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
It was made in Christ with a threefold intention: for God's glory, for the blessing of God's chosen people, and for the shame of God's enemy
Christ, therefore, is the center, circumference, element, sphere, means, goal, and aim of God's eternal economy
Following this prayer, Paul praises God: To God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
There is glory in the Son's declaration of God, for the declaration of God is the manifestation of God, which is glory
Because the Father is the source, the origin, of every family in the heavens and on earth, every family is His expression
It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God , indwelt by the Spirit of God , and mingled with the Spirit of God
In order that we may experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened into the inner man
The more we are strengthened, the more the parts of our inner being are brought back into the spirit, into our inner man
We need to be strengthened in order to stay in our spirit and not be distracted by thoughts regarding so many things
When Paul bowed his knees to the Father, he was so strong in his inner man that nothing could shake him or disturb him
We also need to be strengthened to such an extent that nothing will be able to carry us away from our inner man
We need to practice praying to the Father that He would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man
We should experience the Father's strengthening us into our inner man every day by spending time with the Lord in prayer
In Ephesians Paul tells us that our inner man needs to be strengthened and that we need to pray at every time in spirit
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
He is now imprisoned in our spirit because our mind is set on other things and our conscience is not exercised
It is by repentance and confession that the two main parts of our heart, our mind and our conscience, are opened for the Lord
When we repent and confess in this way, our emotion follows with love for the Lord, and our will also chooses to seek the Lord
Consequently, our entire heart, as the gateway to our spirit, is opened for Christ to fill and strengthen our spirit
Spontaneously, Christ will have the opportunity and the full ground to take possession of our entire inner being
The result of this is not only holiness spirituality and victory but the marvelous mingling of divinity with humanity to produce the church
In order for Christ to make His home in our heart, we need to take Him not only as our life but also as our person
Paul prayed that the believers would take Christ as their person by allowing Him to make His home in their heart
If we take Christ as our person, allowing Him to spread into our heart, the person living in our heart will not be the self but Christ
As long as we are still the person living in our heart, our heart is the home of the self, not the home of Christ
For this reason, we need to pray for ourselves and for others to have the reality of taking Christ as our person in our daily living
The Lord will thus expand in our heart, take possession of our heart, and make His home in our heart in a full way
Eventually, He will saturate our whole being with Himself, and we will live no longer by the self but by Christ
The genuine church life is the issue of Christ personally making His home in our heart to occupy every corner of our inner being
Our experience of Christ must become three-dimensional, like a cube, and must not be one-dimensional, like a line
In our experience of Christ we must go back and forth and up and down, that eventually our experience of Him may be a solid 'cube'
We become strong not only to apprehend the dimensions of Christ but also to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ
Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience
The expression the fullness of God denotes the overflow of the riches of Christ that have been constituted into us
When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches, but when the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness
The Father answers and fulfills the apostle's prayer through the Spirit that Christ, the Son , may make His home in our hearts
In his prayer the apostle prayed that the Father would strengthen the saints according to the riches of His glory
In the doxology he said, 'To Him be the glory' , implying that the glory of God, which has been wrought into the saints, returns to God
Isaacs wealth was first given to Rebekah for her beautification then all the wealth came back to Isaac with Rebekah for his glorification
By means of this two-way traffic the church, as the firstfruits in the universe , takes the lead to give glory to God
God's glorification in Christ is in the realm of all the families created by God, not only on earth but also in the heavens
God's glorification in the church is mainly in this age, whereas God's glorification in Christ is for eternity
In summary, we should experience and enjoy Christ not only as the Dweller in us but also as the Settler in our hearts
Paul prayed that this Christ in our spirit would have an opportunity to make His home in our heart, that is, to make our heart His own home
Christ has been revealed into the saints' spirit, yet with a great many saints, Christ does not have any ground in their hearts
All believers have Christ in their spirit, but most of the believers do not have Christ wrought into various parts of their heart
In the Triune God the Father is the source, the Lord is the course, the means, and the Spirit is the transmission
In the Gospel of John it is the Son into whom we believe , but in the Acts it is the Lord into whom we believe
Christ came to be our life , and He as our life became the element within us, that is, the element of the Body of Christ
Consequently, we the believers have within us another life, a new element, that is, Christ as our life and our element
Although we have believed and been baptized, in actuality we may still remain in Adam and have Adam as the element instead of Christ
Only when we live by Christ and even live Christ will we be the genuine church as the Body of Christ, having Christ as our life and element
In particular, Christ is the center of the Triune God; the Body of such a Christ certainly takes Him as its Head
Faith as our act of believing is personal and subjective, but faith as the content of what we believe is objective
As soon as a person comes to believe in the person and work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, he is made one with Christ
When we believe in Christ, we enter into an organic union with Him; in this life-union we are joined to Christ as one spirit
The life-giving Spirit is working within us so that we may be transformed in soul, transfigured in body, and fully manifested as sons of God
The reality of baptism requires that we realize and confess that our natural being has been crucified and buried
We must realize that both the faith that unites us with Christ and baptism that separates us from Adam are lifelong matters
In 2 Corinthians 4:12 Paul says, 'Death operates in us, but life in you,' and in verse 10 he speaks of 'the putting to death of Jesus'
Ephesians 4:3, 4, and 6 indicate that we the believers are joined to the Lord with the Spirit and the Father for the Body life of oneness
To walk worthily of God's calling, that is, to have the proper Body life, we first need to care for the oneness
The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body
Without the Spirit, there is no substance of the church; without the Spirit, the church is merely a social organization
The Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, and the one Spirit has been wrought into the being of the one Body
Eventually, because the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, we can say that the one Body is one with the Spirit
The Spirit in Ephesians 4:4 refers to the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit who is within the Body and gives life to the Body
According to 1 Corinthians 12:13, the one Body came into existence through the baptism of this all-inclusive Spirit
When we live in the mingled spirit, we will be able to live out the Body of Christ and become His corporate expression
In Ephesians 4:4 the one hope of glory refers to the transfiguration of our body and the manifestation of the sons of God
On the one hand, we appreciate our bodies because they are useful and because without them we cannot exist in this world
For this reason, the worldly people treat us the same as everyone else, without any realization that we are sons of God
Neither the transfiguration of our body nor our manifestation as the sons of God will merely be a sudden, unexpected occurrence
Today the indwelling Spirit is carrying out both the transfiguration of the body and the manifestation of the sons of God
The Triune God Himself, when realized and experienced by us in our daily life, is the fundamental basis and very foundation of our oneness
Most of the time, God cannot get through us because the avenues in our being are blocked to God; He does not have a free way in us
God being in all means that, as a result of our being under God's sovereignty and of our giving Him a thoroughfare, God can abide in us
In Ephesians 4:6 Paul unveils the God of the Body of Christ, the God who is over the Body, through the Body, and in the Body
Day by day we must be under God, allowing Him to pass through us and giving Him the ground in our inner being so that He may abide in us
Because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all one with the Body of Christ, we may say that the Triune God and the Body are four-in-one
The church as the Body of Christ is a group of people who are united, mingled, and incorporated with the Triune God
Out of the Father as the source there is the element, Christ the Son, and within Christ as the element is the essence, the Spirit
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers
In our experience, the Spirit is first because He is directly related to the oneness, to the carrying out of the oneness in the one Body
The most crucial point in this message is that the Body of Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God
By His universal traffic, His victory over His enemy, and His triumphal procession He became qualified to be the Giver of gifts to His Body
Christ then gave them as gifts to the Body for its building up these gifts include apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
Verse 8 says, 'The Scripture says, 'Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men'
Height in the quotation from Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion , which symbolizes the third heaven, where God dwells
Those in Ephesians 4:8 refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led captive those taken captive' as 'He led a train of vanquished foes'
Vanquished foes may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, again indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death
In Christ's ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ's victory
In verses 9 and 10 Paul says, 'Now this, 'He ascended,' what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
As Christ descends and ascends within them, He captures them, vanquishes them, and constitutes them into gifts to His Body
Christ should go down and up within us; Christ should come down to where we are and should ascend with us into the heavenlies
We need to praise the Lord for His traveling, for the marvelous two-way traffic between heaven and earth and between earth and heaven
Following this, He ascended to the third heaven, and all the divine fullness was committed to Him along with all of God's chosen people
The Lord Jesus appeared to Saul of Tarsus, and spontaneously, even in his ignorance, Saul called upon His name, saying, 'Who are You, Lord'?
We should apply this principle to ourselves; we should consider in our actual experience whether Christ has defeated us
He may not be victorious in us and may not have ground in us, because we have not been subdued by Him in our experience
It is not until we become willing to be captured by Christ that He has the ground and standing to make us gifts to the Body
When we are willing to be subdued and captured by Christ, we will give Christ the ground to establish us as gifts to His Body
In order for the Lord to establish us as gifts to the Body, we must not only be captured by Christ but also grow in life
The more we grow in life, the more we will receive the life supply and the more this life supply will enable us to function in the Body
When we grow in life, we will have the rich flow of life, and this flow of life within us will be the function in the Body
Just as our blood supplies the members of our body according to their size, grace also is given to each member according to its size
What kind of member you are depends upon how much of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ you have
The more of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ he has, the greater his function among the saints will be
Just as blood is the life supply to our physical body, so grace is the life supply to the members in the Body of Christ
Ephesians 4:11 says, 'He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers'
Throughout the ages, certain ones have been raised up by God to be apostles and have been given to the church as gifts
The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction
One crucial key to our becoming apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers is the word of God in the Bible
The word of God will then enter into us and become the Spirit in us; with the Spirit, we will have life, understanding, and utterance
The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry
Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of the ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ
The unique work of building up the Body of Christ is the responsibility not mainly of the gifted ones but of all the saints
The gifted persons perfect the saints by nourishing them according to the tree of life with the life supply for their growth in life
The shepherd-teachers perfect the saints by shepherding-feeding and nourishing the young saints and teaching the growing saints
The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body itself in love
Through His resurrection He released all the divine riches and through His ascension He received Gods chosen people with the divine fullness
From the time of His ascension, Christ has been working to constitute the vanquished foes into gifts for His Body
Eventually, those who were once His enemies are transformed and constituted into useful gifts that can be presented to the Body
In Ephesians 4:17-21 and 24, Paul presents the reality in Jesus for a walk that is no longer in the vanity of the mind
In the human living of Jesus there was no vanity but only the reality however in our godless society there is nothing but vanity of vanities
Using a phrase from John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, we may say that, as a whole, today's world is a 'vanity fair'
To learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ
The expression the reality is in Jesus refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels
In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity, but in the godly life of Jesus there is the reality
We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus
Rather He instructed His disciples to gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost which amounted to twelve handbaskets full
The four Gospels reveal that in every detail of the Lord's daily living, there is no vanity but only the reality
After Christ established this mold, He passed through death and resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
When we believed in Christ and were baptized, God put us into Him as the mold, just as dough is placed into a mold
We should allow the new man to live out God; every detail of the living of the new man must be God expressed in our living
What proceeds out of our mouth should be that which is good for the building up of the church and all the saints
When we enjoy Christ in a rich way, every word that proceeds out of our mouth ministers grace to the hearers and builds them up
What proceeds out of our mouth should be the words of grace that are the overflow of our enjoyment of Christ, whom we love and experience
The reality is the shining of light; as members of the Body of Christ under the Head, we should learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus
The life of God in Ephesians 4:18 is the uncreated, eternal life of God, which man did not have at the time of creation
After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life that he might receive the uncreated divine life
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
Through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact the tree of life once more
Ephesians 4:30 says, 'Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
The sealing of the Spirit may be considered synonymous to the anointing, which is the moving and working of the indwelling Spirit
A proper life according to reality and in grace will always make the sealing Spirit happy and give us the joy of the Spirit
The life of God the reality in Jesus and the sealing of the Holy Spirit are the three sources of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The spirit here is the regenerated spirit of the believers, which is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God
As this process takes place, the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind
When our human spirit is regenerated by and thus mingled with the Spirit of God, it becomes the mingled spirit
Our mind needs to be saturated with the mingled spirit and come under the control and direction of the mingled spirit
As those who love Christ, we should not have vanity in our mind; instead, we should have the spirit in our mind
It is by the teaching of the holy Word and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit that we become renewed in our mind
As we daily pray and read the Word, the Spirit will enlighten us and guide us so that we may be renewed in the spirit of our mind
In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, 'Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
In Ephesians 4:24 Paul says, 'Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
The new man is the practical church life, which is Christ as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit in a corporate way
To put on the church life as the new man is to put on this entity produced by the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit
Righteousness is to be right with God and with man according to God's righteous way, and holiness is godliness and devoutness before God
Outwardly, everything related to the new man is righteous; inwardly, everything related to the new man is holy
It was in the righteousness and holiness of this reality, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created
The old man is according to the lusts of the devil, but the new man is in the righteousness and holiness of God
The human living of Jesus was according to the reality, that is, according to God Himself, full of righteousness and holiness
Even how much we laugh or cry should be determined by the principle of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man
It is by the life of God in the Spirit of God that we can live a life full of grace and reality, as the Lord Jesus did
The apostle wanted us to live a life full of grace and reality ; such a life of Jesus should be our life today in the church
When we live and speak reality , we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment
May we pursue the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the reality in Jesus and grace in our mouth for the living of the new man
Light and love form a pair as the source of reality and grace; reality and grace form a pair as the issue of light and love
By enjoying grace and truth, we are brought back to the source of grace and truth, God the Father as love and light
By staying in the fellowship with God as love and light, we become beloved children of God walking in love and light
Because both love and light are God, to be children of light walking in love and light is to be children of God walking in God
It is significant that in speaking of the fruit of the light, Paul mentions only three things: goodness, righteousness, and truth
The reason he mentions only three things is that the fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God
Notice that here Paul speaks not of the work of the light nor of the conduct of the light but of the fruit of the light
The Father as the goodness the Son as the righteousness and the Spirit as the truth the reality are all related to the fruit of the light
As grace and reality are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements in the apostle's exhortation in 5:1-33
After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light
Because we enjoy the love of God in such an intimate way, we do not want to do anything that displeases the Father
In our daily walk we would always take care of the Father's feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love
Christ gave Himself up for us as both an offering, that we might have fellowship with God, and a sacrifice, that He might redeem us from sin
In following His example, our walk in love should be not only something for others but also a sweet-smelling savor to God
We have a person in us who loved us, and now by this person, in this person, and with this person, we can love as He loved
To be filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, our human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
Our spirit should not be empty; rather, it should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God
Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit
Verse 20 goes on to say, 'Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father'
We should give thanks to God the Father not only at good times but at all times, and not only for good things but for all things
We can be the children of light walking in love and light only by the Father's dispensing Himself in the Son as the Spirit into our spirit
When the Triune God in Christ is dispensed into us, we will become in reality the children of God, who is light
As children of light, we will not only live by grace and truth; we will also live directly in God, who is love and light
Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we need to be filled in our spirit with the Spirit as the divine wine
When we are drunk with God as our love and light, we will truly be children of light walking in love and light
The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence
In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ's loving her and giving Himself up for her
In verse 26 Paul says that Christ sanctifies the church by cleansing her through the washing of the water in the word
According to the divine concept, water here refers to the flowing life of God, which is typified by flowing water
Day by day, morning and evening, we need to come to the Bible in order to be cleansed by the laver of water in the Word
By coming to the Word in this way, we are cleansed from the defilement we have accumulated in our contact with the world
All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word
As the church is washed organically and metabolically in this way, the church is renewed to be without blemish
The church that comes out of Christ will go back to Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and went back to Adam
To be holy is to be separated to the Lord from common things and then saturated and permeated with the divine nature, with all that God is
If we would be without blemish, we must be without mixture; that is, we must not have anything other than God in our being
The church will be the expression of God Himself mingled with a resurrected, uplifted, and transformed humanity
In order to be the bride of Christ, the church must become beautiful and have all the spots and wrinkles removed
Our beauty is not our behavior; our only beauty is the reflection of Christ, the shining out of Christ from within us
Today we must prepare ourselves to be the bride by taking in the element of Christ's riches as our nourishment
Ephesians 5:29 says, 'No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
Just as a mother tenderly embraces her baby to warm him and feed him, Christ cherishes us by warming us and nourishes us by feeding us
The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches
If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply
Along with abiding in the Lord constantly, we must daily come to the Word and take it in as our life and life supply
Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him
To be nourished is to have something imparted into us inwardly, whereas to be cherished is to be warmed and comforted outwardly
In our environment or circumstances the Lord Jesus is often real to us as a warm, tender breeze blowing upon us
In the environment of the church life, we often experience the Lord's cherishing, although we may not even be conscious of it
We may have everything necessary for our material existence, but we know that something we formerly enjoyed is missing
When we return to the church life, we immediately and spontaneously enter into the environment and atmosphere of the Lord's cherishing
To be in this climate, this atmosphere, this environment, gives us rest, comfort, healing, cleansing, and encouragement
In the proper church life we have the privilege of enjoying the Lord in such a fine, tender, intimate, and real way
For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh
We should regard a husband and wife not as two separate persons but as one complete person, as two halves of a whole unit
The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, presents a significant and complete picture of Christ and the church
The animals and the birds were brought to Adam, and Adam named them, but for Adam 'there was not found a helper as his counterpart'
When God brought the woman to Adam, Adam exclaimed, 'This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh'
If we see this vision, we will not only understand the type of Christ and the church but also enjoy Christ as the Husband of the church
Because Paul's daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances
Whenever we intend to fight against the powers of darkness, Satan, through his accusations, causes our conscience to become very sensitive
If we have our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, we can withstand any attack of the enemy
If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we will spontaneously have faith
No matter what may happen to us or what kind of sufferings we may experience, we should always believe in the goodness of God's heart
No matter what befalls us, we should not doubt God's will, and we should not care for our happiness or our environment
We all need to have full faith in God in Gods heart in Gods faithfulness in Gods ability in Gods word in Gods will and in Gods sovereignty
If we would have the faith to be defended against Satan's flaming darts, we need a proper spirit with a conscience void of offense
Rather, we must first put on the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes, and then take up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation
Christ as the Spirit and the word furnishes us with a sword as an offensive weapon to defeat and slay the enemy
The Greek word for word in Ephesians 6:17 is rhema, the instant word spoken at any moment by the Spirit in any situation
When the logos, the constant word in the Bible, becomes the rhema, the instant word, this rhema will be the Spirit
The more our spirit is strengthened by pray-reading the Word, the more eager we become to use the sword of the Spirit to slay the enemy
When we have the whole armor of God, including the sword, we are not only protected but also prepared to wrestle against the enemy
The modifier by means of all prayer and petition in verse 18 is related to all six items of the armor covered in verses 14 through 17
It is by prayer that we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God
When Christ empowers us as the heavenly dynamo and energizes us from within, He saturates us and invigorates us
We cannot fight the spiritual warfare in ourselves; we can fight only in the Lord and in the might of His strength
We are empowered by the power that raised Christ from among the dead and made Him to be the Head over all things
In summary, the armor of God that covers us is Christ realized by us as our truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation
May we endeavor to experience and enjoy Him as the constituents of Gods armor in order to fight the spiritual warfare and defeat Gods enemy
Ephesians 6:23-24 records Paul's blessing: 'Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
In the beginning of the book, the apostle's greeting is first with grace as the enjoyment and then with peace as the result of the enjoyment
In the conclusion the elements are presented vice versa, progressing from the result, peace, to the enjoyment, grace
He spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace
By means of the breastplate, our faith and love, which are necessary for a proper Christian life, are preserved
Whenever we take part in spiritual warfare, our conscience must be protected from Satan's accusation by the breastplate of righteousness
The verses concerning faith and love in the Gospel of John, 1 Thessalonians, and 1 Timothy indicate that faith and love go together
One of the main points revealed in this book is that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is also the bride of Christ, Christ's wife
One of the incorruptible things revealed in Ephesians is the Body of Christ as the embodiment and expression of the processed Triune God
We should not love the Lord in the way of corruption; that is, we should not love the lord in a natural way, in the way of the old creation
To love the Lord in incorruptibility is to love Him in our mingled spirit, our spirit regenerated, renewed, and indwelt by the Spirit of God
If we testify in order to make a show or a display, we will function in the old creation, that is, function in corruption
The Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for desiring to make a show; whatever they did, they did so to be seen by men
Both the organization and the practices of the denominations are corruptible things, for they are of the old creation
In Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul speaks of the church as the Body of Christ, 'the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
Of loving the Lord in corruptibility, we should love Him in incorruptibility, that is, in a pure way that can stand forever
Paul concludes his Epistle according to its contents, because whatever is revealed in this Epistle is incorruptible
