   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO A VITAL SKETCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE BOOKS OF EXODUS, LEVITICUS,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND NUMBERS CONCERNING GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WITH HIS CHOSEN AND REDEEMED PEOPLE 4 Scripture Reading: Josh 1:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will consider the matter of God's chosen and redeemed people being ready to take possession of the God-promised good land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE GOD-CHOSEN AND GOD-REDEEMED PEOPLE BEING READY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE GOD-PROMISED GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The vital sketch of the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers first involves God's need for a people to be saved and to go on with Him to enjoy His Christ, to receive His revelation, and to be built up with Him as the processed Triune God that they may be formed into a priestly army to journey with Him and to fight with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, this sketch shows us that, in addition to enjoying Christ, receiving the revelation, being built up with the Triune God, and being formed into a priestly army, this people also needs to be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be disciplined, God's people in the Old Testament had to pass through certain difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is something which we need to realize today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more difficulties we pass through, the more useful we will be to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, this vital sketch reveals that God's chosen and redeemed people needed to undergo different kinds of frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result of all these things, God's people were ready to take possession of the God-promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified and ready to take possession of the land were younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were of the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The older ones, those of the first generation, had passed through many things and had learned many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, they were not qualified to enter into the land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The lessons learned by the first generation surely became part of the heritage passed on to the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their children certainly inherited from their parents all the lessons they learned during the forty years in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By their birth the younger ones were put into a position to inherit the tradition of their family and all that their parents had experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that the fathers spoke to their children about their experiences in Egypt, in the exodus from Egypt, and in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No doubt, the fathers spoke about how they were cruelly treated as slaves in Egypt, about how God in His mercy sent Moses to deliver them from bondage, about how they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month, and about how they marched out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fathers must have also explained to their children that they entered into the wilderness without food but that God fed them with manna and supplied them with water from the smitten rock.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They might have also explained that although they eventually felt that manna was loathsome, they nevertheless appreciated it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The people did not grow any crops, but for forty years they daily received the heavenly supply of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, the younger ones learned about Moses and about the great help he rendered to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses himself was not allowed to enter into the good land, but he contributed many constructive factors to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second generation did not pass through as much as the first generation did, but they received the benefit of what the first generation experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that the older generation told the younger generation about all they experienced, enjoyed, and suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This speaking was part of the raising up, or the building up, of the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What the first generation experienced was not experienced in vain, for it was passed on to the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What the older ones experienced actually was not effective for them, but it was very effective in building up the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, God was able to prepare from the second generation more than six hundred thousand men with a rich inheritance and strong background who were qualified to be formed into an army to fight with Him and for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle is the same with us in the Lord's recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The recovery has been in the United States for twenty-seven years and has passed through many things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you think that all these things have been in vain?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They certainly have not been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These things are being passed on to the younger ones in the Lord's recovery and will be very effective in building them up and preparing them to fight with God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The younger ones in the Lord's recovery have a rich inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because this inheritance is being passed on to the younger ones and even being constituted into them, I have the full assurance that when a further testing comes, there will be a very positive result.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Old Testament, what the second generation received from the first generation made the younger ones ready to take possession of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us now consider the things which prepared them and made them ready to enter into the God-promised land.</S>
