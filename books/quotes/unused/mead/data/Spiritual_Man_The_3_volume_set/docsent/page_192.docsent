   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOCKAGE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spirit requires the soul and the body to be the organs for its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit is like the lady of the house, and the steward and servant must carry out the lady's wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit is also like electricity, and there must be a filament before it can express its light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the soul and body are attacked by the evil spirits and become abnormal, the spirit will be blocked and have no outlets.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The enemy knows the importance of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He often works in a believer's soul and body, causing them to lose their function so that the spirit no longer has an organ for its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this, the spirit loses its victorious position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At such times, the mind may come under attack and become confused.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The emotion may feel lonely and sad, and the will may feel tired and lifeless, unable to direct the person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The body may feel very weak or somewhat lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the believers' soul and body are attacked, and if they do not oppose it right away, their spirit will be blocked; they will not be able to fight vigorously with the enemy and maintain their victorious ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once a believer's spirit is blocked, he loses his vigor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will appear shy or withdrawn, and he will not want to do anything in public.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will prefer to retreat to the rear of the battle line, and he will not want to expose himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may think that this is an enlightenment for him, but actually this is a blockage of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he reads the Bible, he does not seem to have much energy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he prays, he does not seem to have any words to say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he considers his spiritual work and experience, they seem meaningless and even, at times, silly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he preaches, he does not sense any result and feels that he is only going through the motions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this condition persists, the believer will come under further attack and find himself choked and muffled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will continue unless God intervenes through other men or through his own prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a believer does not have the proper knowledge, he will become very bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Usually he does not try to search for the reason, but instead allows it to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Strictly speaking, every spiritual experience and feeling has a cause to it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should study it carefully and not allow it to remain in us indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such an experience happens when there is a blockage of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The soul and body outside the spirit have been locked up, and the spirit has no chance to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan has imprisoned the spirit and locked it up in a dark room so that the soul no longer has the leading of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once the thing that blocks the spirit is removed, the believer will find the outlets cleared, and he will recover his former lightness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very important for a believer at such times to exercise his will to speak aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should speak words of rebuke against the enemy, and he should speak out with a loud voice the victory of the cross and the defeat of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He should single-mindedly oppose the enemy's work in his soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The will must stand behind a person's words and actively reject all blockages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Prayer is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prayer is often the way to remove the blockages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But at these times, one has to pray out loud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best kind of prayer at such a time is to call on the victorious name of the Lord Jesus and withstand all the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One should also exercise his spirit and channel its strength to break open a way to come out.</S>
