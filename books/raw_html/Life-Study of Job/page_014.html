<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. SATAN ATTACKING JOB,<br>AND JOB SUFFERING THE TRIAL IN HIS BODY</H2><P>In verses 7 and 8 we see that Satan attacked Job and that Job suffered the trial in his body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Satan Going Forth from God's Presence</H2><P>Satan went forth from God's presence (v. 7a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Satan's Attack</H2><P>Satan attacked Job by striking him with severe boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head (v. 7b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Job's Pain</H2><P>Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat among the ashes (v. 8). The boils that covered his body were extremely painful. As he sat there in pain, he had nothing to say.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Job's Reaction to His Trial</H2><P>In verses 9 and 10 we have Job's reaction to his trial.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. His Wife's Mocking Reaction</H2><P>In her mocking reaction to Job's trial, his wife said, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die" (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Job's Answer and Reaction</H2><P>In answer and reaction to his wife, Job said, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Should we receive the good from God but not receive the ill?" (v. 10a). It seems that Job's thought here was not according to the commercial principle of gain or loss. In a sense, he was willing to suffer loss. However, his physical pain was unbearable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Job Not Sinning with His Lips</H2><P>In all this Job did not sin with his lips (v. 10b).</P>
