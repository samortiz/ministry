   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE ONENESS TO BRING IN GOD'S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All who are sitting here today are elders and co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be in one accord to maintain the oneness Christ seeks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we are bearing the responsibility of the church, we should see the way for the church to receive grace and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must all realize that the blessing and grace of God can only come upon a situation of one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This situation is the practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, Psalm 133 says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God will only grace and bless the one accord, that is, the practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Finally, I would say that if we only listen to these words without practicing them, they are but doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The practice of oneness touches our mind, our love, and our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unconsciously, we have all violated the practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times our mind is like an unreined wild horse, free from any restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our love is not regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our words are light and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these damage the oneness of the believers and are factors for losing the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we are all living in the church and the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are also bearing the testimony for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it is very easy for our mind to be distracted and for our love to become unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps we do not speak evil words of reviling, but our speaking may be loose, and our opinions may be plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spontaneously, we bring many problems to the church and spread division among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we have to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would first consider and think a little before we speak and would ask if it is Christ or not, there would be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we love the saints, we should ask ourselves if our love has different classes, degrees, or depths, and should be adjusted by the Lord accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true with our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should only speak if our speaking is Christ; otherwise, we should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have a heavy burden within me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all want the church here to receive grace and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But do not forget Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The commanded blessing of the Lord, which is life forevermore, is upon the brethren dwelling together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is like the ointment that flows through the whole body and like the dew that descends on Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Tonight we have seen that the oneness of the believers prayed for by the Lord is neither a oneness like the world speaks of nor a oneness according to what we formerly understood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather it is a perfected oneness by all of us being in the Father's name and life, in His word of reality, and in His divinely expressed glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only by this is there the blessing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, we should labor and work for the Lord, but if our situation is not in oneness and if we do not practice the one accord, I am afraid our result will not be abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in order for us to receive God's blessing, we must practice the oneness, and the way to practice the oneness is by the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, April 5, 1990</S>
