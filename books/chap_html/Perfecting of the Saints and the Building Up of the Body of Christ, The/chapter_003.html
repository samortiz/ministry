<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You for gathering us together into Your name and before Your Word again. We believe that we are one spirit with You. While we are speaking, Lord, do vindicate this matter. As we speak, may You speak in our speaking. Wash us in Your blood. We are all open to You and are hungry for You. May You speak to the depth of every one of us and open our eyes that we may enter into Your mystery and see the mystery of the new way and the mystery in Your economy. Grant us to see that the new way today is an advance in Your economy. Lord, remember that we are weak and poor. Unless You are with us, all of our work and words are in vain. Lord, remember every brother and sister attending the meeting, that no one would return empty-handed, and that everyone would be satisfied by You. Amen!</p>
<p>During the past two Lord&rsquo;s Day evenings, we have seen Ephesians 4:7-16. First, it speaks of the ascended Head giving the gifts, with some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. These gifts perfect the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. This building goes on continuously until we all arrive at three things: first, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. This oneness is carried out in faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God. The knowledge here refers to the experience and the enjoyment. Hence, this oneness is a oneness in practice. Second, we arrive at a full-grown man. Third, we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. If we arrive at these three things, we arrive at the peak. We will no longer be babes tossed by the waves and carried about by the winds of teaching. Rather, we will hold to the truth in love and will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. When we grow up into Christ, everything will be in Christ, and something will issue out from Him to supply the whole Body. By this, all the Body will be joined and knitted together through every joint of the rich supply and according to the operation in measure of each one part, causing the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. In this message we will cover specifically the last two verses of this portion of the Word.</p>
