   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fellowshipping and Coordinating Together</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you see the Body of Christ, you will see the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this coordination, there is no friction, and there is no murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have such things in the Body would make us no different from the political organizations in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible, many times the Lord did not speak to men directly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, the New Testament does say that a man can know God from within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, however, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him again directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, He asked Ananias to go to speak to Saul Acts 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, the life that is seen in the New Testament is a very personal one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, the Epistle of John also says that "you also may have fellowship with us" 1 John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This fellowship is mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, we come to God individually by the blood and through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, we work together, walk together, coordinate together, and serve together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here, there are those who serve and there are those who are served.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the records concerning Paul, Luke, Timothy, and others, we see that among them there was coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever Paul suggested, the others would agree and would carry it out right away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Timothy was a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could have written a letter to Paul, saying, "Brother Paul, I have believed in the Lord for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can pray, and I can seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please give me some liberty!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Timothy did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, every person comes to God independently and is individually responsible to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, no one can be independent, and no one can be free.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being Delivered from the Self</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man's mouth may be very clever, but his mouth does not necessarily represent his person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes, a person may say yes with his mouth, yet disagree within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers and sisters only bring their mouths to the meetings; they themselves are not in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One sister once came to me to discuss the question of submission in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Her mouth was saying that she wanted me to handle the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I knew clearly within me that her mouth and her ears had come, but her being had not come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a person has given up his personal opinions, though he may not readily consent with his mouth, within him he will acknowledge that this is the right thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to learn to be persons who are delivered from our selves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If fifty radios are receiving the same signal from a station, and my radio has a different signal from the same station, my radio is definitely not functioning properly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we live under the New Testament, and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such there is the need for us to be joined to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the coordination of the Body, we have to learn to care for the feeling of the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only then can we have good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not Being Individualistic</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The body is the most beautiful thing there is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet the body can also become the most ugly thing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A man looks very fine if he stands here with all his members attached.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if all I see is isolated members detached one from the other, this would be the most ugly sight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I come into this house and I see two feet at the door, a pair of ears in the room, and a pair of arms at the stairs, how horrible a sight this would be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I will surely run away at once.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, if a person acts independently and is not joined to the Body, he will become a most ugly member.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is one thing for a person to acknowledge that he is a member.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is another thing for this person to be coordinated as a member.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Independent actions in the Body are the most ugly thing there is.</S>
