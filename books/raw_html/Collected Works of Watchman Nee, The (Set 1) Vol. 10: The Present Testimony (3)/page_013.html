<P>Once I met a patient, and I asked him how he was doing. He said that God would heal him. I said that God would not heal him because he did not have His word. There was another nearsighted brother who needed to get corrective glasses, but someone told him that he should believe God and not get the glasses. He thought that his faith might be bigger than that of others, so he went to pray instead. Later he was asked to preach in an evangelistic meeting. He thought that his eyes would be healed after his preaching, and he asked me to pray for this. I told someone that God would not heal him. He asked me why, and I said because he did not have the Word of God. His faith was not faith, but feeling. What he had was not actually faith, but hope. Without God's Word, how can we believe?</P><P>Christ's work is real. But without the Word of God, everyone in the world will still perish. However, if we have God's Word, the whole world will not be able to overthrow our faith. Once the Lord said to His disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" (Mark 4:35). The Lord slept in the stern of the boat. Suddenly there arose a great windstorm, the waves beat into the boat, and it began to fill up. The disciples woke Him and said to Him, "We are perishing" (v. 38). The Lord arose and rebuked the wind and sea. The wind ceased and there was a great calm. What did the Lord say to the disciples? The Lord said, "Why are you cowardly in this way? How is it that you do not have faith?" (v. 40). Since the Lord gave the order to pass over to the other side, He took the responsibility, regardless of the wind and waves along the way. If the Lord has spoken and we still do not have faith, we are casting His word aside. Suppose I give you a ten dollar bill to make change. How do you know that it is ten dollars? You know because it says so on the bill. Whatever God has said is so. God says it, and it is so. If the Lord orders you to pass over to the other side, all you have to do is go. You can speak to the wind, "Blow as much as you will," and tell the waves, "Beat as much as you can." But when the Lord says to pass over to the other side, you will surely pass over to the other side. If you think that the Lord's word only seems to be true and is not quite true, you will sink to the bottom of the sea with the wind and waves.</P><P>Only the Word of God is true. Even when the environment is against you, the Word of God remains true. You may have difficulties with your family, school, business, or even your self. If you do not believe in God's Word, it is useless for you to pray, even if you pray for several hours. If you do not pray, you will not get anything; and if you pray without believing in God's Word, you still will not get anything. If you cannot believe in God's Word, you need not pray, because the prayer will be a vain effort. If you want to obtain God's grace, it is very important to lay hold of the Word of God. Take care of the believing, and God will take care of the working. If a matter is put before you, you have to pray that God will give you a word concerning this matter. Once you have His word, you can use it to confront any difficulty. The Word of God that you have acquired is the sword of the Holy Spirit. Everything mentioned regarding the armor in Ephesians 6 is defensive; only the sword of the Holy Spirit is offensive. As long as you have the Word of God, everything will be overcome. As long as you have His Word, every hardship will pass away.</P><P>One of my friends once spent all the money she had. While reading the Bible, she spoke to God, "O God, please give me a word. I do not ask that You put a thousand dollars in front of me. I only ask You to give me a word." God reminded her of a passage in Psalm 23. The word she got was, "My cup runs over!" At that moment she was far from running over; she was completely empty. Nevertheless, she had the Word of God, and she wrote a hymn in English, a few lines of which read:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>With Jehovah as my Shepherd, <br>There is always something over!<br>Though we have much hardship,<br>There is always something over!<br>With God as my Treasurer,<br>There is always something over!</P><P>She wrote this hymn and sent it to one of her friends. After a while her friend wrote her a letter in return, saying, "After reading your hymn, I realize that God has really blessed you, seeing that you have so much surplus." The friend did not realize that she was in fact penniless. Meanwhile, was God's word in vain? No. After a couple of days, God supplied her through other people. If we have the Word of God, we have many sources. The raven will supply us; the brook will supply us; a widow with only a handful of meal will supply us. Even without all of these, God can open a heavenly window to supply us from above. This is faith.</P><P>Christ's work has been accomplished, and God has said it in His Word. Once you believe, you have everything. The essence of God's word is the Holy Spirit. When you believe in His word, the Holy Spirit will take the responsibility to apply the reality of this word to you. Once you believe, the Holy Spirit will lead you into Christ and into all that He has accomplished. Christ's work is accomplished, and God has spoken. However, if you do not believe, the Holy Spirit will have no way to apply Christ's accomplishment to you.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, you are clear about what God has done in Christ, and you understand it. But why do you still not have it? It is because you do not have faith. You say you have believed and wonder why you still do not have? But I say that you have not yet believed. If you have faith, the Holy Spirit is responsible for making what you have believed a reality. Knowledge is not sufficient. You need faith in addition to knowledge. How many times have we read a whole chapter of the Bible without believing in one verse? In many things, we lack faith. Once you have faith, the Holy Spirit applies to you what you believe.</P><P>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" (Gen. 1:3). Whatever He said, He accomplished. In this universe whatever He says, He will accomplish. In the beginning He spoke, and the universe obeyed Him. Today whenever God speaks, the universe still has to obey Him because no word of God is without His power. This power is the Holy Spirit. Whenever God speaks, the Holy Spirit accomplishes it immediately.</P><P>This is the way a sinner is saved. Whenever a sinner believes the Word of God, the Holy Spirit immediately will give him what Christ has accomplished. Some who were addicted to opium or alcohol experienced an immediate deliverance from these things when they believed in God's word. The only explanation for this is that the Holy Spirit has granted them the power to overcome. I had a classmate who was by nature very tactful; he manipulated the whole class under his hands. Many classmates were afraid of him. Later he was saved, and now he is even one of my co-workers. If one did not know his past, one could never imagine what kind of person he was before. He is what he is today through nothing other than resurrection. The most amazing thing in the world is for a dead person to receive the life of God. After one believes, the Holy Spirit will add what Christ has accomplished to him. Perhaps while he was listening to God's Word, he said, "I believe." Perhaps while he was sitting in the last row, he said, "I believe." Or perhaps while he was walking on the street, he said, "I believe." When he believes, the Holy Spirit adds what Christ has accomplished to him.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, my responsibility is to share this message with you. It would be wonderful if you could believe it. If you would read to God the verse that you heard last week, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands" (Col. 2:11), and if you would read the same verse to yourself, you would gain something. You may think that you have already overcome a few times and that you are now trustworthy. But I have to say, "No." Only the Word of God is trustworthy; your experience is not trustworthy. May God work among us, so that we can believe in what His Word says literally. The more we believe in what He says, the more we gain what He says. May the Lord bless us.</P>
