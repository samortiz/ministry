   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET TO RISING UP EARLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to rise up early, one must go to bed early.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you cannot overcome the habit of going to bed late, you cannot rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you go to bed late and rise up early, your health will be affected; you will be tired all the day, like one floating in the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, all those who desire to rise up early must overcome human affairs and attachments and go to bed early at all cost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One can set the time for going to bed at nine or ten o'clock at night.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the matter of rising up early should begin tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not wait until next week to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you wait until next week, you will never begin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Different people need different amounts of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some have said that on the average a person needs six hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others say that he needs eight hours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There can be much controversy concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Recently an article in the newspaper said that those under twenty-eight years of age should sleep nine hours, but ordinarily the need is eight hours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If one goes to bed at ten, he can rise up at six.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If one goes to bed at nine, he can rise up at five.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I cannot make a decision for you; you have to decide for yourself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we all learn to do this before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who are psychologically weak or who cannot control their sleep are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As for the rest of us, we should find the number of hours of sleep that we need and start this practice tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose you decide to rise up at half past five tomorrow morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you wake up, however, it is already seven o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many young believers have probably experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may become disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best thing is to instruct your servant or someone else to wake you up in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may also spend a dollar or two to buy an alarm clock and put it beside your bed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can also pray that the Lord would wake you up at the assigned hour.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mr. M ller said, "Every day I ask God to wake me up at a certain hour, and I always find myself waking up at that very hour." This is a word of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every morning when we wake up, we have to get out of our bed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not wait five minutes before getting out of bed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do, we will not be able to get out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Proverbs 6:9-11 says, "How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is this not the condition of many people?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we sleep a little and slumber a little, we will rise up the same time as we did before.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The bed is not the place to contemplate; the place to contemplate is the study room.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The bed is not the place to read books; the place to read is the reading room.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The bed is not the place to plan our business; the place to plan our business is the office.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Proverbs 26:14 says, "As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how much the door turns, it cannot move away from the hinges.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The same is true with a slothful person on his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will not be slothful, turning around on the bed all the time yet never being able to get out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the beginning when we start rising up early, our head may ache, our feet may be weak, and we may be drowsy all day and walk with unsteady steps.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after four or five days, all these will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we should not think that we are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a few days, we will find that we cannot make it, and we will realize that we are very vulnerable in the matter of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As men of God we often do not persevere in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are weak and without perseverance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some have asked why they cannot persevere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would ask if they persevere in everything except the matter of early rising.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am afraid that some people do not persevere in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No wonder they cannot persevere in early rising.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some people cannot be persistent in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No wonder they cannot be persistent in the matter of rising up early.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people cannot control themselves in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No wonder they cannot control themselves in the matter of rising up early.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Being unfaithful and loose are simply manifestations of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first day an athlete exercises, he may feel sore.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The second day he exercises, he still may feel sore.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after a week, he will not feel sore anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The same is true with rising up early.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as we develop this habit, we will not find it difficult anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I remember the first year after I became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I went to see a missionary, who asked if I had read through the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I read by skipping from one book to another, and could therefore only answer no. She then asked if I had read through the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I said no. She then asked me what time I rose up in the morning, and I answered, "Six o'clock." She said, "You are nineteen years old now, and I am over fifty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For the past thirty years or more until now, I have been rising up at four o'clock every morning."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I asked how she could do this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She said, "If you exercise yourself enough, your body will spontaneously behave a certain way."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She went on to say, "If you rise up late, the manna will all melt away."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Mr. M ller also benefited greatly during his life by rising up early.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once he traveled to another place and lived in a brother's home.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He rose at six o'clock, but the other brother rose earlier than he did.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He wondered and asked why the other brother would rise so early.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The brother answered, "The book of Leviticus says that one cannot offer the dung of the sacrifices on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I cannot offer my dung-hour to God."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From that day, Mr. M ller prayed to have the strength to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He agreed that if a young Christian does not rise early in the morning, he cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Recently, I read from a book some words written by Mr. Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He said that he once read that a person must first receive the Lord; second, he must be filled with the Holy Spirit; and third, he must rise up early every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When he first read this, he thought the three points were unrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But later he realized that they were not unrelated at all.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If a person is to have a sustained experience of the first and second points, he must rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Otherwise, he will not enjoy what he has obtained through the first and second points.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brothers and sisters, I will stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now is the time for you to test if you can control yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How great is your faith?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How great is your consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>And how great is your self-denial?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you pray for the Lord's blessing, beginning tomorrow, you will see that the Lord will readily help you.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the morning, you should spend at least half an hour to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You can spend as much as an hour or even two to three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you do this, you may not have a whirlwind of joy every day, but you will surely experience a peaceful sky every day.</S>
