   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHAT TO DO WITH ONE'S CONCUBINE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible there is no command telling man to separate himself from his concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nowhere in the Bible does God ask man to send his concubine away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am talking about concubines whom one took before he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible I think there is sufficient indication of how God wants man to take care of concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps we should look first at man's demand before considering the Bible's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man's immediate thought is to send away all his concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the concubine cannot be sent away, man's thought is for the husband to discontinue sexual relationships with her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a human concept, and unfortunately many brothers and sisters hold this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is not God's revelation; it is in fact a heathen thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. The Bible Never Demanding</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That Concubines Be Sent Away</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible no one took a concubine in a worse way than David.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He not only took a concubine but even committed murder in taking that concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Uriah died because of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David sacrificed Uriah to gain Bath-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Solomon was born of Bath-sheba, and so was the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord acknowledges this fact in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 1 tells us about four women.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Bath-sheba is included and is spoken of as the wife of Uriah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be clear about this fact: Those who have taken concubines should submit to God's disciplining hand; they should never chase their concubines away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does the Bible not demand that the concubine be sent away?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please bear in mind that the sin of fornication and that of taking a concubine are two completely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I steal a Bible today, I can return another Bible tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I steal one thousand dollars today, I can return one thousand dollars tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if I take a concubine today, I have no way to return her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some brothers think that all concubines should be sent away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a consideration from the male's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All males should know that in God's eyes taking a concubine is equal to committing adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, on the side of the concubine, when she marries a male, she is not married to two husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The male is married to two women, but the concubine is not married to two husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to see that the Lord never asks the man to send his concubine away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I think the principle behind Solomon's mother is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord sent Nathan the prophet purposely to David after David married Bath-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything the Lord needs to say concerning this subject has already been said through Nathan; there is no need for you to add anything to his word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if Nathan had missed anything, there would still be no need for you or I to add a footnote to the subject three thousand years later.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nathan told David that his son would surely die, and judgment would come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others would commit fornication with his wives in the sight of the sun, and the sword would never depart from his house 2 Sam 12:7-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nathan did not ask David to send Bath-sheba away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he were to send her away, what would she do?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Uriah was already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some are without their Uriah today, while the Uriah of others is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God sent Nathan to David, He did not ask David to chase Bath-sheba away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In fact, God later caused her to give birth to Solomon v. 24 . God did not cause any of the wives of David to give birth to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He caused David's concubine, Bath-sheba, to give birth to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, the first page of the New Testament says, "And David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah" Matt 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament does not say that one can take a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But it does not say that one needs to chase his concubine away either.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>B. Her Duty of Marriage Not Being Diminished</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Exodus 21:9-11 specifies that if a master betroths a maid to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the son properly marries another later, the maid will become a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's ordination is clear: Her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he does not do these three things to her, she shall go out free and be a slave no more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, if anyone thinks that he cannot have intercourse with his concubine, he is not keeping the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope that you can be clear about this matter.</S>
