   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God is not only breaking us on the negative side but also constituting us on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the life of Jacob in Genesis, we can see the meaning of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob's life began from a low point.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He struggled with his older brother in his mother's womb and strove to be the firstborn by holding on to his brother's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was crafty and greedy, always deceitful and taking advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He deceived his own father, brother, and uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the end he was deceived by his uncle and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He tried his best to prosper, but in the end he found himself in a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can say that Jacob's way was fraught with suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people spend their lives in ease and comfort, but Jacob's life was full of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While he was going through his sufferings, God was breaking him down again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He suffered one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every experience he went through was a suffering to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But thank God, after going through so much suffering in His hand, he finally acquired a touch of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see this when he was in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There we see a gentle, humble, bright, and dignified man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was so meek and humble that he could ask for grace and mercy from his son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet he was so crystal clear that he could utter prophecies which Abraham could not utter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could give blessings which Isaac could not give.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was so dignified that even Pharaoh bowed his head to receive his blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows us that through God's breaking work, the lowly Jacob had become someone God could use.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jacob had become a man of God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After years of breaking, God constituted Jacob with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why we can see such a beautiful picture at Jacob's deathbed when he leaned on the top of his rod and worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Though he was sick in bed, he could still lean on the top of his staff and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This proves that he still remembered his pilgrim life and had not given up his pilgrim characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At first he struggled to sit up, put his feet down by the bed, and prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After prophesying, he gathered up his feet, gave up his breath, and died.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way he died was beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is indeed a beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can muse carefully upon the whole life of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the time he was born, I am afraid no one had a worse "taste" than he had.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when he left the world, his old taste was gone altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we see is a man fully constituted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must realize that everything that comes upon us is for our edification one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God tears us down through all kinds of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tearing down can be quite painful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But after we pass through these trials, something will be constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, when trials arise, it may appear that we are failing, but His grace will always carry us through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the process of overcoming our trials, something is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we overcome our trials again and again, the constitution within us grows day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, God puts us through difficult circumstances and tears us down through our trials.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, something is added into us as we rise from our trials.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank God that we have the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May God have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May He break us and constitute us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we may reach maturity.</S>
