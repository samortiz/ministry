   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DECAYING OF THE OUTER MAN AND THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 7 of chapter four says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No doubt, we are the earthen vessels, and the treasure within us is Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can this treasure within us be prevailing, manifested, and ministered to others?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no other way but by our brokenness through the working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Soul Standing with the Body or the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 16 says, "Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here is a great problem in our study of the Word: What is the outer man, and what is the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may be quick to answer that the outer man is the natural man, and the inner man is the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if we answer in such a hasty way, we will make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not easy to expound a verse or chapter of the Scriptures, and it is easy to interpret in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The right way to expound any part of the Word is to understand its context.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to read the entire context of 2 Corinthians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to verses 10 and 11, outer man refers not only to the soul but even more to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10 says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Strictly speaking, the outer man in this chapter refers to the body, but it includes the soul standing with the body and controlled by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the body connected and incorporated with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Under God's sovereignty our body is always put into suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The body together with the soul is always being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most of the sufferings of the apostle Paul were the consuming of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He suffered very much in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to verse 9, he was "cast down but not destroyed."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that when he was persecuted, his body was cast down, but he himself was not killed, not destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of the things mentioned in this context refer mostly to the suffering and consuming of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the soul has much to do with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When our body suffers, our soul also suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have some kind of suffering in our body, it is difficult for our soul to suffer much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The soul suffers mainly through the body's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What then is the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Strictly speaking, the inner man here does not refer to the spirit alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It refers to the soul, our inward part, with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:6 confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It says that our mind, the main part of our soul, can stand with the flesh or with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our soul stands with the flesh, it becomes a part of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it stands with the spirit, it becomes a part of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the meaning of the outer man and the inner man in 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being Renewed through Sufferings</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The outer man is the body with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This has to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The inner man is the soul with the spirit, and this has to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By our experience we can realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are suffering, perhaps from a certain kind of sickness, this is a suffering through the body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this time, however, not only our body is consumed, but our soul is also consumed, while at the same time, our soul is revived with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before the time of suffering, our soul was very much involved with our body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, after a period of suffering, our soul turns much to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The relationship between the soul and the body is consumed, and the relationship between the soul and the spirit is revived and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If persecutors beat us and put us into prison, we will no doubt suffer in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, our soul which is related to the body, will also suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our soul were not related to our body, it would not suffer when the body suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our soul suffers when our body suffers because the two are "married."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because our soul is related to the body, the Lord raises up suffering for our body in order to turn our soul away from the body to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, after our sickness or imprisonment, that is, after our suffering in the body, the result is that the soul turns away from the body to the spirit and is transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is purified from a relationship with the body and brought into a revived and renewed relationship with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then our mind, will, and emotion are revived, strengthened, and renewed spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before we suffer, our soul is too attached to the body and too much for the body as a part of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the Lord needs to deal with the outer man to cause the outer man to suffer, that is, to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more the outer man is consumed, the more our soul turns away from the flesh to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, the soul is renewed and revived with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the proper meaning of decaying and renewing in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then our soul will not be so attached to the body, that is, to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our soul will be purified, adjusted, renewed, and turned to the spirit to cooperate with the spirit and be incorporated with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This renewed soul the renewed mind, will, and emotion is suitable to express Christ for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once again, this is a word not of gift or knowledge but of a living ministry.</S>
