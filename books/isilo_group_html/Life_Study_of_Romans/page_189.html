There it says, &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; This divine electricity is rich to all who &ldquo;switch on,&rdquo; and the way to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; is to call on the name of the Lord. By calling on the Lord we exercise our spirit. If we simply think about what the Lord is to us, we do not have any practical contact with Him. Remember, 10:12 says that the Lord is rich to all who <i>call</i> upon Him. How simple this is! By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus we are released from the vanity of the natural mind, and we are kept in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING WHAT IS RELATED TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Designation is by resurrection, which includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. All these wonderful things are in the Spirit. By touching the Spirit, we enjoy resurrection and everything included in it. Resurrection is not a matter of doctrine; it is absolutely a matter of touching the Spirit. The most simple way to contact the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. The more we touch the Spirit, the more we enjoy resurrection and the more we are sanctified, transformed, and glorified.</p><p>According to the book of Romans, the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God is related to at least ten items. All ten of these items are related to our experience of the reality of resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">Holiness</h2><p>Firstly, the Spirit is related to holiness (1:4). We have pointed out that Paul even uses the term the Spirit of holiness in 1:4. If we would partake of God&rsquo;s holiness, the essence of God&rsquo;s being, we need to contact the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Life</h2><p>In 8:2 the Spirit is called the Spirit of Life. Many Christians today talk about life without realizing that life is related to the Spirit. Life is extremely difficult to define. In speaking about life, it is best to speak from the standpoint of experience. Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life. To be in life means that our inner being is living. By setting the mind on the spirit, we are living. However, if you set your mind upon your situation or your environment, you will be deadened. You will sense that your inner being is depressed. But if you turn your mind to the spirit and set it on the spirit, you will be living once again. This indicates that life is manifested as livingness.</p><p>Life also energizes us. The divine life within us is never exhausted. I can testify that as I speak in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, the life within energizes me.</p><p>Furthermore, this same life strengthens and satisfies us. When we experience life, we never have a sense of emptiness within. On the contrary, we are richly satisfied. Hence, by life we become living, energized, strengthened, and satisfied. The more we contact the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we become living, energized, strengthened, and satisfied.</p><h2 class="head2">Law</h2><p>According to 8:2, the Spirit is also related to law. This verse speaks of the law of the Spirit of life. Here Paul tells us that this law sets us free from the law of sin and of death. The law of the Spirit of life is versus the law of sin and of death. Because the law of the Spirit of life is higher than the law of sin and of death, it sets us free from that law.</p><p>We have spoken about the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life. Actually, the Spirit <i>is</i> holiness and life. In the same principle, the Spirit is the law that sets us free from the law of sin and of death. This law is a spontaneous, automatic power. Whenever we touch the Spirit, we touch this law, this spontaneous, automatic power. If we see this, we shall realize the vanity of expending our own effort to improve ourselves. Instead of striving, we should simply contact the Spirit and give place to the spontaneous working of the law of the Spirit of life within us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_188.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_190.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Romans &nbsp; pg 189</div><br></body></html>
