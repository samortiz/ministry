   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING THE CHURCH BY COMING BACK TO THE PROPER GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today there are about thirteen million Jews on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of these thirteen million, however, only about two million have returned to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the thirteen million claim to be Jews, but only those two million who went back can say that they are the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not wrong for them to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can say to them, "Why do you call yourself the nation of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are sectarian for claiming this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The nation of Israel includes all the members of the race of Hebrews."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, it includes all members of the race of Hebrews, but most of them would not go back to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even the United Nations recognizes that only those who have returned are the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many dear friends have come to challenge me, asking, "Why do you call yourself the church in Los Angeles?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are we not also the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have replied, "Thank God you are the church, but you are not at home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are like the Jews who are in New York, not in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may be a Hebrew,' but you are in Japan, Germany, or France'; you are not in your fathers' land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as a Jew stays in New York, he should not and cannot blame those who say they are the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You cannot be the nation of Israel in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must be the nation of Israel in the fathers' land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same way, do not argue about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, if you want to be the church in Los Angeles, come back home."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt, all the believers in Los Angeles are the members of the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why then do they stay in the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they do not come back, that is their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They must not put the blame upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, if someone is a Jew today, I would advise him to go back to Israel at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same principle, if someone is an honest Christian, I would advise him to come back to the church at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE BUILDING BEING WITH THE RETURNING MINORITY, NOT WITH SPIRITUAL GIANTS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under God's economy, all His people in the Old Testament were in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to their degradation, however, some were carried away to Babylon in the east and to Egypt in the south.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Were they not Hebrews?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every one of them was a Hebrew, but many of them were Hebrews in captivity, in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The people, the persons, were right, but the place was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After seventy years the Lord gave the commandment, and some, a minority, a small number, went back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spiritual giants such as Daniel remained in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among the returned ones there were almost no spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, they were a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some even married Gentile wives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless of that, however, the rebuilding of the house of God on this earth was not with the spiritual giants in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The rebuilding of the temple was with the returning minority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of how spiritual the Hebrews were, in the captivity they never had the Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, however, the glory of Jehovah filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, the first coming of the Lord Jesus to the earth was brought about not through those at Babylon but through the descendants of the returning ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus was supposed to be born of a descendant of David in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If in the ancient times there had been no return from the captivity, how could Christ have been born?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It would have been impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regardless of how good the spiritual giants in Babylon were, they were useless for the Lord's first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only the little descendants of the returned captivity, like Mary and Joseph, were very prevailing to bring the Lord to this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must care not only about our spirituality but about God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether one is spiritual or not spiritual in Babylon makes little difference, but whether or not he returns makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With the return there is the rebuilding of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the return there is the glory coming down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With the return there is the first coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a matter of our spiritual situation or condition, of our personal spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a matter of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today it is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That is why I say that if someone is a Hebrew, he should do his best at any cost, to pay any price, to go back to Palestine to join the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a matter of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If one is an honest Christian, however, he must do his best to get into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no argument about this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If someone does not do this, he will "miss the boat."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot delay the Lord, but we may not be gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord will still go on, but we may not "make the boat."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not care for a large scale; we care for the standard and the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not here for any movement.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are not here for gospel preaching, although we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not here for the inner life, although we have much of it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not here for Bible study, although we know the Bible very well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are not here for any gift, although we have the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What are we here for?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are here for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are here for the building.</S>
