<h2 class="head1">OUR SOUL BEING UNDER<br />
THE CONTROL OF OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Where there is death, there is resurrection. Death opens the way for resurrection power to work in us. Without death, God&rsquo;s resurrection power cannot work on our soul. We can use the illustration of installing electric cables in a house. Electricity can flow wherever electric cables are installed. This example shows the relationship between death and resurrection. Death can be compared to the electric cables, and resurrection, to electricity. Death was not the end of the Lord. After death He was resurrected. The resurrected Lord is even more glorious than He was in the flesh. In the same principle, after experiencing death and resurrection, our soul will be uplifted, enriched, and strengthened with the divine life. A flower is prettier than its seed. If a seed does not pass through death, it cannot be resurrected and grow to become a beautiful flower. Something that is in resurrection is always more glorious than something that has not experienced death.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:14 mentions &ldquo;the fainthearted.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>fainthearted</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;little-souled.&rdquo; A sister who is little-souled cannot bear much burden; she becomes anxious and distressed when something happens. She is also unforgiving toward those who offend her. Such a believer can be saved from being little-souled only by experiencing death and resurrection. By means of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, her natural life will enter into death and then resurrection, and her soul will be uplifted and strengthened. After experiencing death and resurrection, Paul&rsquo;s soul was uplifted. For this reason, he could be greatly used by the Lord to the point that he could testify before King Agrippa and Festus, the Roman governor (Acts 26:24-29). This shows Paul&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Some people may think that if the soul is uplifted and strengthened, it will suppress the spirit. This is not the case. Initially, however, when man&rsquo;s soul did not have the element of God, it could suppress the spirit. But after man&rsquo;s soul experiences death and resurrection, he receives more of God&rsquo;s element, and his soul comes under the ruling of his spirit. Suppose some bandits are recruited by the government and become officials in the army. In their new position they must obey the government&rsquo;s orders. Similarly, in the past our soul was small, independent of God, and disobeyed the spirit&rsquo;s command. After we experience death and resurrection, our soul is uplifted, but it remains under the control of our spirit. After we experience death and resurrection, our thoughts are enriched, our emotions are more fervent, and our will becomes stronger. Thus, all three parts of our soul are subject to our spirit and are controlled by our spirit; hence, they become more useful to the Lord. This is the difference between the natural soul and the soul that has been transformed. The natural soul is fallen. The basic principle of being fallen is being independent of God. This is also the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, because man cannot live apart from God. When the soul is transformed, it is no longer independent of God; it is under the control of the spirit.</p>
<p>Before we are able to differentiate between our spirit and our soul, we do not depend on God. It is not that we are not willing to depend on Him, but because we do not feel a need to depend on Him, we can make proposals and depend on our insight. After we experience death and resurrection, there is a change in our nature, and we become dependent on God. The work of death and resurrection causes us to have a change in nature because the divine element is added to our human element. God&rsquo;s element is in our resurrected soul, because the Spirit of life, who is God Himself, has enlivened our soul. As a result, our soul likes to depend on God and no longer likes to give opinions or to have preferences. In such a soul, divinity is mingling with humanity; hence, this soul is under the ruling and control of the spirit. This is the situation of a believer who is experiencing death and resurrection.</p>
<p>James 1:8 speaks of a double-souled man. A double-souled person is often double-minded; it is hard for him to make a decision, and he tends to be doubtful, distrustful, and indecisive. This kind of person can be saved only through death and resurrection. After experiencing death and resurrection, such a believer will become decisive and will also be firm and stable. This is the issue of the natural soul being transformed in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING SPIRITUAL AND<br />
BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S IMAGE</h2>
<p>When we were saved, our spirit was enlivened, but nothing happened in our soul and our body. From the time of our regeneration, God began to work in order to save our soul. Through death and resurrection we can enter into Him and receive His element. One day, after entering into resurrection, our body will be transfigured to become a glorified body. At that time, our humanity will have been completely brought into divinity. Therefore, from the day we were regenerated until the day we meet the Lord, God&rsquo;s work in us is directed toward the transformation of our soul and the transfiguration of our body. This process of transformation involves death and resurrection. The result of transformation is our humanity being mingled with divinity. By such a mingling we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son; that is, we are transformed into the same image as the Lord, from glory to glory (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18). When people contact a believer who is in this process, they sense the flavor of God. Such a believer&rsquo;s thoughts, preferences, views, and proposals have the flavor of God. This is a spiritual person; his nature and his image have changed, because he has been transformed into the same image as the Lord.</p>
