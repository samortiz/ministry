<H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(10)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHO THE ROBBERS ARE</H2><P>Question: In John 10 the Lord says, "All who came before Me are thieves and robbers." Who are the thieves and the robbers? (Du)</P><P>Answer: The Lord Jesus is not referring to the prophets of old. This word refers to the scribes who had been controlling the Judaistic thought for four hundred years, since the cessation of the prophets who prophesied through inspiration concerning Christ. These scribes were not sent from God, but were teaching by themselves. The prophets came before the scribes, whereas the scribes came before Christ. The Lord is not condemning the prophets. He is referring to the scribes as the thieves and the robbers, because they stole and robbed the flock of God to cause them to listen to themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTISM AFTER REGENERATION</H2><P>Question: If a believer has been sprinkled and is now regenerated in his spirit, is it all right if he does not go through an immersion again? (Wang)</P><P>Answer: This question should not be asked this way. You should not have asked if anyone who has been sprinkled and who has since been regenerated ought to be baptized by immersion. The biblical baptism is one in which a person is immersed into water. Sprinkling is not considered a baptism by the Bible. Hence, all those who have been sprinkled have not yet been baptized according to the Bible. Your question should be, "Should a regenerated person who has not been baptized be baptized?" If you ask this way, even you yourself will know what to answer. According to your question, a man can be baptized even before he is regenerated; this is not found in the Bible. The only baptism that counts as biblical is the baptism performed after regeneration. If a man is not regenerated, he is not yet a believer. The biblical baptism is only for the believers. You can pick out any verse in the New Testament on baptism and find this to be the case. Even if sprinkling could be considered a kind of baptism, an unregenerated person should not receive such a kind of sprinkling. The Bible likens baptism to burial (Rom. 6:4). When those who once lived in sin are baptized, they are being buried. Baptism is for the regenerated ones. Hence, a regenerated person must be baptized according to the Bible. Even the Lord Jesus had to fulfill this righteousness. How much more should we do the same? After the house of Cornelius was baptized in the Holy Spirit, they still had to be baptized in water. Why should a regenerated person not receive the scriptural baptism?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTISM AND HEALING</H2><P>Question: Does the water in John 5:6-8 refer only to the water of baptism? (Tsai, Tai-Chan)</P><P>Answer: Not only is this not referring only to the water of baptism; it has in fact nothing to do with the water of baptism at all. There is not the slightest hint to show us that this is the water of baptism. Recently, some have thought that the baptismal water could heal people. Perhaps they base their belief on this passage. This is absolutely a kind of demonic teaching. We warn God's children to stay away from this kind of teaching. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the water of baptism can heal people. There is no such record, there is no such teaching, and there is not such an example, not at all. Is it not too unreliable to base a teaching on healing on one misinterpreted verse alone?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH AND THE LAW</H2><P>Question: Do the words in Matthew 5:17-19 on fulfilling the law and practicing the law refer only to the Jews? Do they have anything to do with the church? Please instruct me. (Tsai, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: Matthew 5:17 is speaking of the Lord Jesus, not about the world. No one in the world can fulfill the law and the prophets. Those who try to do this are either ignorant of themselves or trying to supersede the Lord's work. This fulfilling refers to the redemptive death of the Lord Jesus. Hence, if a man says, "If the Lord Jesus had to fulfill the law, does not a Christian have to do the same?" he is saying that since the Lord Jesus had to redeem man from sin, the believers should also redeem man from sin! The law in verse 19 refers to the teaching on the Mount. This is not for the Jews. Please read verses 1 and 2. Because of the "crowds," the Lord went up to the mountain. He only opened His mouth to teach the disciples. The disciples are the Christians (Acts 11:26). Hence, the teaching on the Mount, which is the law in verse 19, is for the Christians.</P>
