   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MYSTERIES OF THE KINGDOM 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 13:3-6, 11, 18-21; 1 Cor 3:9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew is a book concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, John the Baptist proclaimed the kingdom of the heavens; the Lord Jesus later followed this preaching and taught His disciples to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He sent out the twelve and also the seventy to preach the kingdom of the heavens Matt 10:5-7; Luke 10:1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The things mentioned in Matthew are related to the kingdom because the kingdom is the subject of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is easy for people to be distracted when they read the book of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christian readers have been distracted by the good stories and by the excellent teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some Christians consider Matthew a book of stories, while others consider it a book of teachings and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both of these approaches neglect the main topic of Matthew which is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew is not merely a book of stories or of doctrines; it is a book on the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John the Baptist proclaimed that the "kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" Matt 3:2 , but in fact what happened was that the man Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the kingdom is simply the Lord Jesus, not only in Himself, but in so many people, including us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This wonderful Man, the Lord Jesus, is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Never forget chapter one of Matthew which gives us the record of this wonderful Person who is Jehovah-plus and God-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus, the wonderful One, as Jehovah-plus and God-plus, is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom is the Lord Jesus Himself and the Lord Jesus in all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the totality of Christ as life spreading into us with all His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also correct to say that the kingdom is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I appreciate all of these statements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The kingdom is not only a dispensation or a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom is also Christ as life spreading into us, growing constantly until maturity, which will be the full manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE MYSTERIES OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus referred to many mysteries, one of which is the parable of the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This parable is not merely a doctrine or a teaching; it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people pay attention to the doctrines, but neglect the mystery of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kingdom of the heavens is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even man himself contains many mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outwardly, we can behold a man's physical characteristics: his head and shoulders, his arms, legs, and skin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because all these external features are quite evident, they are not so mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man himself, however, embodies several mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One is the mystery of his physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible to produce a wax model which is the same color, size, and shape as a real person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only difference is that the model has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we were to dissect a man to examine all his parts, the life would disappear; but if we leave him alive and whole, the life will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one can adequately explain the physical life of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another mystery related to man is his human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is the human spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where can it be found inside a man in his heart or head or stomach?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the Bible, we do have a human spirit 1 Thes 5:23 , but where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While it is easy to locate our eyes and nose and ears, it is difficult to locate our spirit because it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A further mystery concerns the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man has two hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One is the physical heart that beats constantly and pumps blood continually.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the Bible says that man's heart is corrupt and incurably wicked Jer 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This, of course, does not refer to the physical heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Bible declares that man's heart is corrupt, it refers to another heart, his psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we have two hearts one physical and one psychological.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although few of us have difficulties with our physical heart, every one of us has problems with his psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where is this psychological heart?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You know that you have such a heart, but it is difficult to locate because it is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man embodies many mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The human life, the human spirit, and the psychological heart are all mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our mind, emotion, will, and conscience are mysteries.</S>
