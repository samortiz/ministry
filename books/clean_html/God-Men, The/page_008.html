<h2 class=head2>E. To Be the One New Man for the Body of Christ</h2><p>The one new man is for the Body of Christ (Eph. 2:16). To build up the Body, the God-men as the constituents of the new man must be raised up by growing up (Eph. 4:15). The spiritual raising up is not like the natural cultivation. It is to raise up the God-men to grow unto maturity, so that these God-men will do the work of building up the Body of Christ (vv. 12, 16).<h2 class=head2>F. Having the Believers as His Constituents, Who Are Christ and in Whom Is Christ</h2><p>The constituents of the new man are the believers, the God-men, who are Christ and in whom is Christ (Col. 3:10-11). According to Colossians 3:11, Christ is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). In the new man He is the centrality and universality. He is the constituent of the new man, and He is all in all in the new man.<h2 class=head2>G. To Be the Corporate Christ</h2><p>All the God-men are the corporate Christ. This corporate Christ is in all the constituents, the members, of the new man. This means that the new man, as the totality of the God-men, becomes the corporate Christ. What kind of teaching could cause us to become Christ and even the corporate Christ? Only the teaching of the Bible. The Bible teaches the God-men to constitute the new man, and the new man is the corporate Christ.<h2 class=head2>H. By the Believers Putting Off the Old Man and Putting On the New Man through the Renewing of the Spirit in Their Mind</h2><p>The new man was created by Christ, but the believers need to partake of this creation. To bring forth this new man, first Christ’s creating work on His cross was needed. Christ has already accomplished that work. In addition, every day we need to put off the old man and put on the new man through the renewing of the spirit in our mind (Eph. 4:22-24).<p>Our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit (Rom. 8:16). Today our spirit is not a single spirit; it is a mingled spirit. This mingled spirit can enter into our mind. By our loving the Lord, by our praying to the Lord, and by our reading the Bible, our mind is filled with the mingled spirit. This changes and renews our mind. Our renewed mind then becomes a renewing mind. After I was saved I began to love the Lord, to pray to Him, and to read His Word year after year. This brought the mingled spirit into my mind, and this mingled spirit within me changed my mind, my view, and my thinking. Such a changed mind renews our entire being. This is to complete Christ’s creating of the new man.<p>Christ created the new man, but this creating has not yet been consummated. Christ has created us to be a new man, but after we are saved, we need to partake of this creation by putting off the old man and putting on the new man by having our mind filled with our mingled spirit. All these words are a heavenly language; they have nothing to do with philosophy or human logic. This is the divine revelation from the Bible. We all need to see this. Because I have seen this, no one can change me in my vision.<h2 class=head2>I. To Be the New Creation of God</h2><p>The new man, created by Christ on the cross and consummated by our putting off the old man and putting on the new man through the renewing of our mind by the mingled spirit, eventually becomes the new creation of God. The God-men constitute the new man, and the new man eventually becomes the new creation.<h2 class=head3>1. In Christ as the Element</h2><p>The new creation is in Christ as the element (2 Cor. 5:17). The very Christ is the element, the factor, of the new creation.<h2 class=head3>2. As the Unique Accomplishment in God’s Economy</h2><p>The new creation is the unique accomplishment in God’s economy (Gal. 6:15). The consummate point of God’s economy is the new creation. This new creation eventually becomes the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God’s divine work (Rev. 21:2) carried out through four ages of humanity by God Himself in Christ and through the Spirit as the Triune God. By God in Christ through the Spirit in our spirit, this new creation is consummated to be the New Jerusalem. This will show God’s wisdom, as a shame to God’s enemy Satan in his cosmos (Eph. 3:10).
