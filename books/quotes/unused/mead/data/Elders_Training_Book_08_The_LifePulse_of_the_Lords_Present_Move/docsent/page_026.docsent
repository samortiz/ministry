   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new way is first to build the church in, through, and based upon the home meetings, having the church life in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not care that much for having the church life in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not believe that it is possible to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to our experience and observation, the proper, adequate, one hundred percent church life could only be possible in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, the new way is to lead every member to get used to functioning without any idea to depend on any giant speaker, thus annulling hierarchy, clergy, position, and ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Drop the idea of a special speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is a foreign article put into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let there be no more giant speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christianity depends on the giant speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is a fallen state, the condition of the book of Judges.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Judges whenever a great man became a judge, he rescued the people, and they had a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the man leaves or dies, the revival also dies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is not the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This way will surely rescue me from my concern for the ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the way to annul the ambition and to give up control.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, the new way is to teach all the saints to know the basic truths in an educational way that they may teach others for the spreading of the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This should have been one of the goals for the Lord s recovery to carry out, but we had a failure due to our inadequate practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this purpose and goal we want to have truth lessons, to teach all the saints to know all the truths in an educational way that they may teach others for the spreading of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fourth, the new way is to build up the saints in the growth of life that they may minister life to others, shepherd each other, and take care of the backsliding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is one stone that could kill three birds to have growth in life, to have adequate shepherding, and to take care of the backsliding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today there is an accumulation of many backsliding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must practice the new way to take care of every backsliding one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not like to have an accumulation of thousands of backsliding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a shame that no one takes care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The saints come to the big meeting to have a giant speaker to speak the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After that they go back home and leave the responsibility of shepherding to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is impossible for the elders to care for ten thousand people, and it is not fair to charge them with such a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The shepherding should be one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even as a strong member I need a young one to shepherd me, to take care of me, to do some things for me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, you also need me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible to carry out this shepherding in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It can only be done in the small gatherings with ten or twelve members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone there knows each one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Surely you can take care of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will build up the best communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Human beings are communal; we like to have a community.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, it is hard to have the best communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most communal life is rotten, corrupting, and ruins people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only the church communal life is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope that even in many cities we will have at least two hundred homes where the proper, pure, communal church life is being carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That will surely attract the best people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters who intend to go full-time, do not think to go the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My burden is to impress you with a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The home gatherings should be very much helped by the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the full-timers should learn to the uttermost how to help the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must do a lot in the home meeting, yet nothing you do should replace anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This requires the top skill.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to our natural habit, either we do it all ourselves or we do not do it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do it, we do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We keep everybody far away, leaving the job to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That is replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The full-timers have to learn how to go into a small gathering with about eight persons and do much to teach the truth, preach the gospel, and minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone will get the help, but no one will have the feeling that you are replacing them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They all feel that they themselves are doing the job.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may wonder how this could be possible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Simply go to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then you will know how it can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To play the piano or the violin is a hard job for me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, my grandchildren play the violin quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They learned by practice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After they do their homework, they also practice on the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually they could play it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I never practice, so I cannot do it nor do I know anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It depends upon the skill, and the skill depends upon practice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The main thing needed for the new way is for the full-timers to be trained in two things preaching the gospel and helping the small gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must know how to go out to reach people for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then every week you have to spare one night to attend the home gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Taipei with about four hundred home meetings, they could have eight hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Two could go to one gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In that gathering are at most twelve, and of this number there are two experts to do everything for the attendants, yet without any replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Could you do this?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Just as a cow could not play a piano, you may not be able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, you need to be not only changed but revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You need to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a new way; it is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When I first heard of the airplane, I said that it could never be done.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This was my old idea, but now I am quite convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I would like to convince you that this can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although it may seem that I am not speaking about the truth lessons, I actually am.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I am speaking about something in newness of spirit Rom 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the past we have spoken of being in the oldness of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I would change the word letter to routine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You are keeping yourselves in the oldness of routine.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Many young ones in the United States would say they are so glad to have the new training.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They would like to change with the new way to spread the glad tidings and to go to the home meetings to do many things for everyone there, yet without any replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They will want me to teach them to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I would like to do it, but I still need to go back to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you have the heart and you do mean business, you will hear more about the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Fifth, the new way is to lead all the saints to preach the gospel in every possible way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There are many ways and many objects for our preaching, including our schools and home, the people on the street, our neighbors, and many more.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sixth, the new way is to avoid leadership as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are not going to practice anarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We do not intend to have anarchy, but neither do we want monarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We need quite a good government but without leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We only have one governor, the Head, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The only way to annul all the position, leadership, and ambition is to have a strong practice of the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In any home meeting do not set up a leader and do not try to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Otherwise, we will have many who consider themselves to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Actually, Christ is the Head not you.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Try your best to avoid any kind of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Some may wonder how this could work without any leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This will work because of the unique Head.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you and I would not be the Head, this will give Him the best way to exercise His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We have been frustrating Him too much.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Lastly, the new way is to have the home gatherings for home nurture.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>For any human being to be raised up he needs a proper home nurture as well as a school education.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The home gatherings are for the home nurture, and the bigger meetings are for the school education.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In the human life we need the home to nurture us and the school to educate us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must use the Lord s Day morning to train our people with the truth, while the small meetings in our homes are for home nurturing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to carry out at least these seven things in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Please fellowship about this matter one with another in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is worthwhile for even two or three to spend time to fellowship about these points.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This will revolutionize your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>These all are basic points and principles.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The new way is to make the home meetings as homes to nurture our children, the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Then we will have bigger meetings mainly on the Lord s Day as schools to educate our people.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We will have nurture and education, nurture by the home meetings and education by the bigger meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We must consider the home meetings as homes and the bigger meetings as schools.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Pray about these seven items very much after you return home.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>You should have a period of time for training, at least two weeks, to train the saints in your locality with all these points.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The points need not be in good sequence as long as you cover every point.</S>
