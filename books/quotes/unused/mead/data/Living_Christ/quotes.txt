[1]  CONTENTS Living Christ Only Living Christ Living and Walking According to the Spirit
[2]  CHAPTER ONE LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:17-20; 15:4-5; 16:9; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE BIBLE AND GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN
[3]  The theologians in Christianity do not have the concept of eating Christ and living Christ.
[4]  If they hear this kind of speaking "eating Christ to become Christ" they are bothered and are quick to judge it as heresy.
[5]  Christ is God, so how can you say that you are Christ?
[6]  Therefore, if I ask you if you can declare, "To me, to live is Christ," you can only utter a soft "amen."
[7]  Brothers and sisters, please consider, how much do you live Christ in a day?
[8]  After the creation of man, God placed man before the tree of life that man might eat of the tree of life.
[9]  We all know that the tree of life signifies God, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies anything that does not belong to God.
[10]  Whether you are moral or immoral, whether you are honest or dishonest, whether you steal or do not steal, whether you are a robber or a gentleman, whether you are quarrelsome or peaceable, whether you are a shrewd woman or a virtuous woman, all belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[11]  If you pray to the Lord, "Lord, You are my life; I am one spirit with you; Lord, You are in my spirit," you will live in your spirit and will be in constant fellowship and contact with the Lord.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO ONLY LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 14:23; 15:5; Gal 2:19-20; 5:2, 4; 6:15 MAN LIVING BY THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL
[13]  God's eternal plan is to work Christ into us.
[14]  Thus, Christ being worked into us is God coming into us to be our life.
[15]  Day by day we read much about Christ, pray much to Christ, and hear much about Christ, but we do not live Christ very much.
[16]  Throughout the ages, there have been too many substitutes for Christ.
[17]  This will definitely shock you, causing you to wonder how things from God can replace Christ.
[18]  The Lord Jesus once told the Pharisees, saying, "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:39-40 . Today there are many theologians and Christians who read and study the Bible, yet they are not willing to contact Christ in their spirit.
[19]  Consider three brothers from Japan, three brothers from Indonesia, and three brothers from the southern islands of the Philippines.
[20]  You may see that all these brothers have been saved and have Christ in them.
[21]  All that I have said is to prove to you that it is really difficult to live Christ, and it is even more difficult to live only Christ.
[22]  Mere doctrines regarding Christ are not Christ, the life-study messages are not Christ, and even the Bible is not Christ.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE LIVING AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4, 6, 14; Gal 5:25; Eph 6:18; 1 Thes 5:17, 19; Rev 1:10a THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT
[24]  The Bible ultimately shows us one thing: God passed through creation, incarnation, more than thirty-three years of human living on earth, and death on the cross; then He came out of death and was resurrected.
[25]  THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL
[26]  At this time I would like to impress you with this word: live and walk according to the Spirit.
[27]  I want to tell you that as long as you ask what to do, that is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[28]  NOT HAVING METHODS BUT SIMPLY EATING THE LORD JESUS
[29]  The Lord Jesus said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."
[30]  May I ask you, How much of the Lord have you eaten today?
[31]  Rather, it means that you breathe and enjoy the Lord so that there is an atmosphere between you and the Lord, an atmosphere in which the Lord is with you, and you are with the Lord.
[32]  LOVING THE LORD AND LETTING HIM MAKE HIS HOME IN YOU
[33]  In order for you to have this exercise, you need to do two things.
[34]  First, every day you need to pray, "O Lord, I love You.
