   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN LEARNING IN THE WORK THE WORKERS MEETING THE LOCAL NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE OVERSEAS PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After much fellowship we are clear that several brothers need to move for their service and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some brothers want to move, and there are places that have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, it may be necessary to reassign the responsibilities of some co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This applies to our service in Taiwan, particularly in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning going abroad, we feel that we should take care of Japan and Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is an urgent need in Tokyo and Bangkok.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope that at least two brothers can go to Bangkok or that a brother and his family can go there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At least one brother should go to Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is also a need for some brothers to go to different places in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It would be good for more brothers to receive a burden to go overseas for the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, if a brother has a clear leading from the Lord and has a burden to go to the West, especially to America, it would be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the urgent need is in Tokyo and Bangkok.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that some brothers will be open to seek the Lord s will and receive a burden to go to these places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, in the past most of the co-workers in Taiwan stayed in one place for a long time and bore the responsibility there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The workers did not travel and labor in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In principle, we stayed in one place and were responsible for the work in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We did not work like the apostle Paul, who traveled from place to place without staying for long in any one place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It may be time for us to have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean we should all move to different places, but we need to make changes that will involve a few workers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There should be a group of workers, brothers and sisters, who receive the leading to travel from place to place on a regular basis to supply the needs of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BENEFITING THE WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the fellowship from the brothers, some workers cannot leave immediately to supply the churches, but other workers can.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A brother who receives the burden to go to supply the churches in different places should help the church where he is and also set aside a portion of his time to travel for the supply of other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way the workers can supply other churches and learn more related to the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will enlarge their heart and broaden their view.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The workers who do not travel regularly can stay in larger cities, such as Kaohsiung and Taichung.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The workers who travel regularly can stay in smaller cities, such as Chiayi and Tainan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They should go to a place and then return to their locality when it is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is time for us to work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will benefit from traveling to different places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will prevent the workers from being narrow in their view, and it will enlarge their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The workers who travel to supply other churches will be enlarged in their view and capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BENEFITING THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, when a co-worker goes out from his respective locality, the saints in his locality have an opportunity to serve and supply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the worker returns, he can help locally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With the service being carried out mainly by the local saints, the workers can assist and guide the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the workers are in a place, they should advise and assist the saints so that the saints will be able to take care of the practical service after he departs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the worker returns, he can consider the service of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some areas of service may need adjustment, and the saints may need support or motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will perfect the local saints who have the opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need a good coordination in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some of the co-workers who travel can labor in the gospel, but they should not preach the gospel outside the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They should preach the gospel in coordination with the brothers and sisters in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way the church will preach the gospel, even when the workers bear responsibility for giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>OUR PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The best practice is for two workers to travel together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The biblical principle is to go out two by two and work in coordination Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The workers can hold conferences related to the building work, helping the saints in the matter of life or in reading the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is best to go to the different places in twos and work in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the churches in Taiwan will have an opportunity to receive the supply from many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, some of the local brothers will have the opportunity to rise up and learn to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will, in turn, provide the workers with more opportunities to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The workers who travel should first go to places that are close to their present locality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will give the saints in their locality the opportunity to bear more responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the local saints are able to bear more responsibility, the workers can go to places that are farther away.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With time, the workers as well as the local brothers will receive practical training.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is our present need.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some saints may feel that we should continue to stay in one place for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Other saints may agree with this change in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are many patterns in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The apostle Paul stayed in one place for three years Acts 20:31 , in another place for a year and six months 18:11 , and in several other places for a much shorter time 13:42, 44-52; 14:1-21; 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was flexible, because his labor was based on the need.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, we should not be as rigid in our labor as we have been in the past, when we stayed in one place for a long time and visited other places occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is time for us to travel to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The localities that are new may not be ready for this change, but the local saints in more established localities should be given the opportunity to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although the workers can guide the saints, their main responsibility is to supply the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A worker should be able to supply even the church of another worker.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For example, a worker in locality A can supply locality B, and a worker in locality B can supply locality A. In this way there will be a mutual supply, and the capacity of life and service in the local churches will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A worker who travels to supply the churches should not abandon his locality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Just as Paul returned to Antioch, the locality that sent him out, the workers should return to the locality that sent them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul was sent out to labor, but he returned to Antioch to fellowship with and supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He did not abandon Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul continued to care for the church in Antioch while he cared for the churches that were raised up among the Gentiles 14:26-28; 15:30, 35; 18:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The brothers need a proper understanding of this matter, but we do not need rules related to how the workers travel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The brothers should always be ready to receive the Lord s leading to visit and to render practical help to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How long the workers should stay in a place depends on the Lord s leading.</S>
