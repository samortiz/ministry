<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><P>Verse 1: "And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him." This verse should immediately follow the end of chapter seven.</P><P>Verse 2: "And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me." From the other Gospels, we can see that this leper was healed before the giving of the teachings on the mountain. In contrast to the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Matthew was not written absolutely according to historical order.</P><P>Each writer of the Gospels has his own characteristic in arranging the order of the events. Matthew records the Lord's acts and words, whereas Mark records mostly the Lord's acts and very little of the Lord's words. This is because Mark shows the Lord as a slave. A slave should not speak too much. Mark especially uses the word "immediately," whereas Matthew especially uses the term "the kingdom of the heavens" thirty-three times. Since the word "immediately" is often used in Mark, everything recorded in the book is according to historical order. Therefore, of the four Gospels, the Gospel of Mark has the most accurate chronology of historical events. Regarding the chronological order, Mark is more accurate than Luke, and John is more accurate than Matthew. The words used quite often by John are "the next day" or "the second day." Thus, the chronological order in John is more accurate than that in Matthew.</P><P>Matthew, Mark, and Luke are concerned in particular with the events that occurred while the Lord was in Judea; John writes specifically about the events that occurred while the Lord was in Galilee. Of course, this is not absolutely so. The order in Luke is according to morality, while the order in Matthew is according to doctrine. The miracles in Mark are recorded approximately according to chronological order, as can be seen in the incident of crossing the sea in Mark 4:35-41.</P><P>The order of the events recorded in Matthew 8 (as edited by him) is as follows: (1) the cleansing of the leper, (2) the healing of the centurion's servant, and (3) the healing of Peter's mother-in-law. However, according to chronological order, they should be as follows: (1) the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, (2) the cleansing of the leper, and (3) the healing of the centurion's servant.</P><P>Why did Matthew record these events in such a way? Because the Gospel of Matthew, from the beginning to the end, intends to show people the strictness of the kingdom of the heavens. Matthew's record uses the kingdom of the heavens as the backbone, as the center, and speaks continuously along the same line. Therefore, he puts the facts together without caring for the historical order. Luke is written with morality as its goal, which is to speak forth how God grants mercy to men. Therefore, in Luke we can see God's salvation in every section. John speaks of the Lord's preaching in Galilee. Galilee is sometimes called "Galilee of the Gentiles." Therefore, John writes with the world as the criterion and eliminates all the background.</P><P>Why should "behold" be inserted at the beginning of verse 2? This is to get people's attention because what follows is a special case. For instance, even Elisha dared not to see Naaman or to get near him, but ordered him to wash himself (2 Kings 5:10). In the Old Testament there are the ordinances of how the lepers can be cleansed (Lev. 14), but here we have the healing of the leper. Therefore, verse 2 begins with " behold."</P><P>According to history, the order of the events in this chapter is as follows: (1) the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, (2) the cleansing of the leper, and (3) the healing of the centurion's servant. These events are recorded in a different way because they are types.</P><P>There were many lepers, but only one was healed. The Jews were like lepers. They all committed sin, but among the Jews, only a small remnant received grace. The servant of the centurion was a Gentile. Because Israel would not receive grace, salvation went to the Gentiles.</P><P>In Luke it was recorded that the centurion sent some elders of the Jews to entreat the Lord. This is to show that salvation was of the Jews. Matthew was written to the Jews. However, in order to show that the Gentiles can come to the Lord directly, Matthew did not mention the elders of the Jews. The leper was healed by being touched by the Lord. This shows that the Jews were related in the flesh to the Lord. The servant of the centurion was healed, but the Lord did not touch him. Rather, He spoke a word from a distance. The centurion heard it and believed, but the servant did not see the Lord. This shows that the Gentiles are saved through believing. What the Lord has ordained for us today is that we believe without seeing (John 20:29).</P><P>Leprosy signifies the filthiness of sin and refers to the Jews. Paralysis signifies the impotence of sin and refers to the Gentiles. Fever signifies the energy of the flesh in disobeying God. Sin causes man not only to be filthy but also to be impotent. Filthiness is something before God and needs to be cleansed. Weakness needs power.</P><P>Peter's mother-in-law was healed because Peter had an intimate relationship with the Lord. This shows us that after the Gentiles have received salvation, the Lord again will be gracious to Israel for the sake of Abraham and David. Fever refers to the situation of the tribulation, since tribulation is like a furnace. Matthew recorded these events in such a way to emphasize the doctrinal aspect. Verse 17 refers in particular to the millennium, because in the kingdom the power of death ceases to exist. Although death will be there, it is for the punishment of sin, because those who will be born during the millennium may not all be saved ones. Their death will be due to God's punishment.</P>
