This teaching by anointing adds the divine elements of the Trinity, which are the elements of the anointing compound Spirit, into our inner being. It is like the repeated painting of some article: the paint not only indicates the color, but also by coat upon coat being added, the elements of the paint are added to the thing painted. It is in this way that the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12168' href='#ref_12168'>Exo 30:25</a></span> And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.<br><b>fn 1 </b>This holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices (vv. 23-24), is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; cf. notes 39<sup>1</sup> in John 7 and 19<sup>4</sup> in Phil. 1). The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: (1) flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (John 19:39), signifies the precious death of Christ (Rom. 6:3); (2) fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death (Rom. 8:13); (3) fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3); (4) cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection (Phil. 3:10); and (5) the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit (Gen. 1:2). Since the number four signifies the creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26), and the number one signifies the unique God (Deut. 4:35; 1 Tim. 2:5), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God's creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. Lev. 2:4 and note 3). The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9 and note 4) through Christ's sufferings (Matt. 26:36 and note). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being split by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (Matt. 25:2 and note 1), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility. Since the numbers three and five are related to God's building (see note 15<sup>2</sup> in Gen. 6), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God's building. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God's eternal dwelling place.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12169' href='#ref_12169'>Exo 30:26</a></span> And with it you shall anoint the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony,<br><b>fn 1 </b>The compound ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle with all its furniture, the altar with all its utensils, the laver and its base, and the priests, to make all these things holy, separated, sanctified, to God for His divine purpose (vv. 26-30; cf. 1 Pet. 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 15:16). Thus, this ointment signifies the Triune God processed and consummated through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach His chosen and redeemed people and to anoint them with Himself, making Himself one with them and making them one with Him (John 20:22; 1 John 2:20, 27; 2 Cor. 1:21; 1 Cor. 6:17). Such an anointing, being the moving of the compound Spirit within us, applies to us and also adds all the elements of the processed and consummated Triune God into our inner being so that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements and we may be mingled with God as one.<br>The holy anointing oil is solely for the purpose of anointing God's dwelling place and the priesthood (cf. 1 Pet. 2:5 and note 7). Hence, only those who are for God's dwelling place and for the priesthood can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive Spirit.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
