   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>J. Josiah Frustrating Pharaoh Neco's Expedition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates, Josiah frustrated Pharaoh Neco's expedition and was killed by him v. 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>K. Buried in Jerusalem by His Servants</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Josiah was brought to Jerusalem by his servants and was buried there in his grave v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The history recorded in the Old Testament is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The history books were put into the Holy Scriptures because, in typology, they give us a vivid view of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The essence of the typology of the Old Testament history is God's economy with Christ and His Body as the center and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In one of the books of history, 2 Samuel, we see that David, a man according to God's heart, wanted to build a house, a temple, for God 7:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, God did not need that kind of house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, God wanted to build David a house v. 11b . Through a prophecy in typology, God told David that eventually the house that He would build for him would have a seed and that this seed would be God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seed would therefore be both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would be a human seed, yet it would also be God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ was God becoming the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that God Himself, the divine One, became a human seed, the seed of a man, David.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This seed was Jesus, the God-man, Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus is our Creator becoming our Savior, our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the creating God who became a man by being born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He remained in the womb for nine months according to the principle ordained by God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He came out of that womb, He was no longer only God; He had become the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This God-man lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years and then entered into death through crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His crucifixion He accomplished redemption and terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The death of Christ was the death of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In one of his hymns Charles Wesley wrote, "Amazing love! how can it be/That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hymns, #296 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The One who died on the cross and shed His blood was a man, yet Acts 20:28 tells us that this blood was God's own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The death of this wonderful God-man was all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It terminated the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The One who created Adam died on the cross as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 , the last of mankind, to end Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within Adam there is a sinful nature, or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Adam was terminated by the cross, the sin within Adam's nature was also terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, this sinful nature in Adam is just Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, when Adam's nature, sin, was terminated, Satan was also destroyed Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition, the world, which was invented by Satan and is one with Satan, was also destroyed through the death of Christ on the cross John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's wonderful death ended the fallen man, and through this He ended man, sin, Satan, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, through His death Christ released the divine life within Him to be dispensed into all God's chosen and redeemed people, regenerating them with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Christ entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life-giving Spirit is the Creator God who became a man, lived a human life, passed through death, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today our God, unlike the God of the Jews, is not only divine but also human.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not only God but also man, with Christ's death and its effectiveness and with His resurrection with its power, all compounded together to be the life-giving Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Triune God was embodied in Christ, who eventually became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, who is the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we have the consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ, and the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit who is the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Resurrection is not just a matter; resurrection is a living person, the Lord Jesus Christ John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the resurrection and in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For us today the reality of resurrection is Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since He is in resurrection, we, His believers, should also be in resurrection and live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Resurrection means that all the old, natural things have been terminated and that something new and spiritual has been germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is resurrection the termination of the natural and the germination of the spiritual, to transform the natural into the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In resurrection we do not live a natural life but a life that was terminated in the old nature and germinated in the new nature to make us members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ today is a corporate Christ with many members 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that He is not only the Head but the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we have the very essence of God's economy, with Christ and His Body as its center and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this economy God became man in order to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead through a marvelous process.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With God this process was incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With us this process is regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has become man, and eventually man will become God in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the eternal economy of God will be accomplished.</S>
