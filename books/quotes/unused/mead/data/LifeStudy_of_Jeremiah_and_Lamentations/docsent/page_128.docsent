   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give a brief further word on the new covenant, focusing on the inner law as the center, the centrality, of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NOT TO BE ANNULLED</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the principle of the Bible, a covenant should never be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is especially true of a covenant enacted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Like the sun, the moon, and the stars, the new covenant will remain forever 31:35-37; 32:40; 33:20-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE INNER LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING THE CENTER OF THE NEW COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The center, the centrality, of the new covenant is the inner law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jeremiah 31:33a says, "This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This law is not an outward law but an inward law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In its essence, this law refers to the divine life, and the divine life is nothing less than the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive Christ, and the processed and consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and realization of the all-inclusive Christ, and the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, this inner law, remaining in our being all the time, reminds us that the very processed and consummated Triune God the Spirit, the Son, and the Father is with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that the law is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this law is the divine life, and the divine life is the processed and consummated Triune God the marvelous source as the Father, the wonderful element as the Son, and the excellent essence as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the center, the content, and the reality of the new covenant.</S>
