   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING LIGHT FROM THE SPEAKING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times Christians have asked where we get the light that is conveyed in our writings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regarding this matter of light, we have no reason to boast in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We receive our light from the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to receive light, we need God's speaking on the proper ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today God is still speaking in the tent of meeting, that is, in the center of oneness and on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tent of meeting is the ground, the base, of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is in this place that God's word is spoken to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from God's speaking, we are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when His word comes, we are in light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where God's speaking is, there is always light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of us can testify that before we came into the Lord's recovery, we were in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now we have the sense that everything is clear and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As you listen to messages, you experience the Lord's shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether in the meetings or at home, you realize that you are under the Lord's enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This enlightenment comes from God's speaking on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, to those who inquire about the source of the light we have received, we can only say that we have light because we are on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ABUNDANTLY SATISFIED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The children of Israel not only enjoyed the oracle of God; they were also abundantly satisfied with the fatness of God's house Psa 36:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's house refers to the temple, which was the continuation and enlargement of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Psalm 36:9 the psalmist goes on to say, "For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse is also related to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only in the temple could God's people enjoy the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, it was in the temple that they could see light in God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a further indication that the essence of the oneness of God's children is life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LIFE MAINTAINING THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is confirmed by Psalm 133, which begins with the words, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in oneness!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The psalm concludes like this: "For there the Lord commanded the blessing, life for evermore."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As this psalm makes clear, the blessing of life is related to the oneness of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalm 133 also speaks of the ointment and the dew of Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The precious ointment and the dew were not omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, they were to be enjoyed only at a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If an Israelite wanted to share in the Lord's commanded blessing, he had to be in the place of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that, at least three times a year, he had to make a journey to Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose some from the tribe of Dan were to say, "Why must we all go to one place for the worship of God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is too narrow, too sectarian, and too exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can stay here in Dan and enjoy singing praises to God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those from Dan could enjoy singing, but unless they went to Mount Zion, they could not enjoy the commanded blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The principle applies today also.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would be under the Lord's commanded blessing of life, we must be on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Dissenting ones may claim to have the commanded blessing, but actually they do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who think they do are superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is neither narrow nor exclusive, but He is definite.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is definite regarding His principle and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God will never act contrary to His definiteness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 3 of Psalm 133 is very definite.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here the psalmist says that there upon the oneness, the Lord commands the blessing, life forevermore.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the oneness of brethren dwelling together the oil flows, the dew descends, and God's people enjoy life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we lose the oneness, we lose the experience of the oil, the dew, and the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we would remain in the oneness, we must remain in life, because life maintains the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was true with the children of Israel, and it is true with us today.</S>
