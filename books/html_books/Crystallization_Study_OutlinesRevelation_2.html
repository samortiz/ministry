<h1 class="title">The Temple with the Ark<br />
and<br />
the Principle of the Man-child</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 11:19; 15:5; 16:17; 12:1-11; 11:15</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The center of the second section of Revelation (chs. 12&mdash;22) is the temple with the ark&mdash;11:19; 15:5; 16:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The throne with the rainbow in 4:2-3 is the center of all the judgments executed over the earth in chapters six through eleven on the negative side.</li>
	<li>The temple with the ark is the center of all God&rsquo;s accomplishments in the universe carried out in chapters twelve through twenty-two on the positive side&mdash;11:19.</li>
	<li>The main thought of the second section of Revelation is God&rsquo;s building&mdash;15:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The vision of the temple with the ark is not for us to be holy or spiritual&mdash;it is for us to be built up&mdash;11:19.</li>
		<li>The temple and the ark are for God&rsquo;s testimony, and God&rsquo;s testimony is God&rsquo;s expression of Himself through His building.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ark in the temple signifies Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony&mdash;11:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The ark signifies that God must be faithful to Himself, that He will not do anything that comes short of Himself, and that what He desires to do He will accomplish&mdash;2 Tim. 2:13; Eph. 1:9-11.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s character is the basis upon which God and Christ will reign forever and ever and upon which God will cause the kingdom of this world to become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ&mdash;2 Tim. 2:13; Rev. 11:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The revelation in the Bible leads us from the throne of God&rsquo;s government to the temple of God&rsquo;s expression&mdash;4:2; 7:15; 11:19; 15:5; 16:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Revelation first shows us the throne as the center of God&rsquo;s judgment and then the temple as the center of God&rsquo;s testimony&mdash;4:2-3; 7:15; 11:19; 15:5.</li>
		<li>Ultimately, in 16:17 the throne and the temple are combined:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Here God&rsquo;s judgment is mingled with God&rsquo;s expression, with God&rsquo;s testimony.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s judgment comes out of God&rsquo;s testimony and is for God&rsquo;s testimony.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In Revelation we see God on the throne and God in the New Jerusalem&mdash;4:2; 22:1:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God is on the throne for His administration, but He is in the temple for His expression&mdash;4:2-3; 7:15.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s throne is for His temple; that is, God&rsquo;s administration is for His expression.</li>
			<li>In the New Jerusalem, God will be in the Lamb on the throne in His temple, having His dominion with His full expression for eternity&mdash;22:1; 21:23, 11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because the church has not attained to God&rsquo;s purpose, God will choose a group of overcomers who will attain to His purpose and fulfill His demand; this is the principle of the man-child&mdash;12:1-2, 5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The man-child refers to the overcomers in the church, to the portion of the people of God who are overcomers&mdash;2:26-27; 12:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All of God&rsquo;s people should have a part in His eternal purpose, but not all assume their rightful responsibility; therefore, God chooses a group from among them&mdash;the man-child brought forth by the woman&mdash;12:1-2, 5.</li>
		<li>The overcomers are the instrument that enables God to achieve His purpose; the man-child enables God to move&mdash;vv. 10-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The man-child consists of the overcomers who stand on behalf of the church, take the position which the whole church should take, and do the work for the church&mdash;2:7b, 11b, 17b, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21; 12:5, 11.</li>
			<li>When God gains these overcomers, His purpose will be attained, and He will be satisfied.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The universal bright woman represents the totality of God&rsquo;s people, and the man-child is the stronger part within the woman&mdash;Gen. 3:15; Rev. 12:1-2, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Bible the stronger ones among God&rsquo;s people are considered a collective unit fighting the battle for God and bringing God&rsquo;s kingdom down to earth&mdash;vv. 5, 10-11.
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>War is raging between the dragon and the woman; however, the battle is fought not by the woman but by the man-child&mdash;vv. 1, 3, 5, 11.</li>
			<li>In the war between the dragon and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, the battle is being fought by the strong ones, by the man-child.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God will use the man-child to fulfill His economy and to accomplish His purpose&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; 2 Tim. 1:9; Eph. 1:9, 11; 3:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God needs the man-child to defeat His enemy and to bring in His kingdom that His eternal purpose might be accomplished&mdash;Rev. 12:10.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the practicality of God&rsquo;s economy today, and His economy can be carried out only by the man-child.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The rapture of the man-child is a transaction that causes Satan to have no more position in heaven&mdash;vv. 5, 7-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This indicates that the overcoming saints will exert a great influence upon the coming warfare in the heavens&mdash;vv. 5, 7a.</li>
		<li>The rapture is for God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s strategy; we must be raptured to fulfill God&rsquo;s need by executing His judgment upon His enemy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The man-child is related to God&rsquo;s most important dispensational move&mdash;Matt. 6:9-10; Rev. 12:10; 11:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God wants to end this age and bring in the age of the kingdom, and for this He must have the man-child as His dispensational instrument.</li>
		<li>The rapture of the man-child brings an end to the church age and introduces the age of the kingdom&mdash;12:5, 10.</li>
		<li>The rapture of the man-child to heaven, the casting of Satan to earth, and the declaration in heaven signify that the man-child will bring the kingdom to earth; this is God&rsquo;s greatest dispensational move&mdash;vv. 5, 9-10; 11:15.</li>
		</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Way to Become the Man-child</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:2, 5, 10-11; Gal. 4:19;<br />
Luke 1:53; Eph. 3:16-17; 6:17-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The entire being of the man-child is saturated and permeated with the element of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The woman in Revelation 12 has been impregnated by her Husband in order to bring forth something for her Husband&mdash;vv. 2, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church&rsquo;s duty is not mainly to do something for Christ but to receive something of Christ that she may be made pregnant of Christ and may bring forth the man-child for Christ&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16a; 2:20; 4:19; Phil. 1:21.</li>
		<li>The principle in becoming the firstfruits or the man-child is the same: we must follow the Lamb wherever He goes by having the Lamb constituted into our being&mdash;Rev. 14:4; cf. Exo. 12:8, 11.</li>
		<li>We need to constantly be open to the Lord as our Husband to permit the element of Christ, the divine constituent of Christ, to work in us continually to saturate and permeate our whole being&mdash;Matt. 5:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whether or not we will be included in the man-child depends upon how we react to God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s move, and God&rsquo;s eternal economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would be a part of the man-child, we must eat more, grow more, and become stronger&mdash;Rom. 5:10; 1 Cor. 16:13; John 6:57.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery depends upon the hungry ones, the stronger ones, not the indifferent ones&mdash;Luke 1:53; Matt. 5:6; Rev. 3:16-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to become the man-child, the stronger part within the woman, is unveiled in the book of Ephesians:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The key to our becoming the stronger part within the woman is for us to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may build Himself into our hearts&mdash;3:16-17; 1 Cor. 16:13; 2 Tim. 1:6-7.</li>
	<li>In order to become the man-child, we must also be nourished with all the riches of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:8, 18; 1 Tim. 4:6-7.</li>
	<li>The way to be strong is by putting on the whole armor of God, which is the all-inclusive Christ, by pray-reading the killing word&mdash;Eph. 6:10-11, 17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way we fight against the enemy is by prayer&mdash;v. 12; Dan. 6:10; 10:11-14, 19-21.</li>
		<li>The way to fight is to take the word by means of all prayer so that the word becomes a sword for slaying the adversary and all the negative things within us&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
		<li>We should not simply have one way of prayer but every means of prayer, exercising our spirit to pray in various ways to take the word of God&mdash;Eph. 3:14; cf. 2 Sam. 7:25, 27; Dan. 9:2-3.</li>
		<li>As word after word penetrates into our being, our opinions, concepts, desires, and choices are slain&mdash;cf. Rev. 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Those who constitute the man-child overcome the devil (the accuser, the slanderer), who is Satan, the adversary of God&mdash;Rev. 12:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>They overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan may accuse us, but we can answer that the blood of Jesus Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, cleanses us from every sin&mdash;1 John 1:7.</li>
		<li>Any apparent condemnation that does not stop after we have confessed and applied the blood is not God&rsquo;s enlightenment but Satan&rsquo;s accusation&mdash;v. 9.</li>
		<li>We must not only reject the accusations which are without cause, but we must also reject all the accusations which have cause.</li>
		<li>When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him all the more&mdash;Matt. 26:28; cf. Heb. 10:29.</li>
		<li>We must always apply the blood, telling the devil that although we are not perfect, we are under the perfect blood&mdash;1 Pet. 1:18-19; Acts 20:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>They overcome him because of the word of their testimony:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Testimony&rdquo; means to tell others what there is in Christ, and the word of testimony is something which must be spoken forth.</li>
		<li>The overcomers must frequently proclaim the victory of Christ, testifying that the devil has been judged by the Lord&mdash;1 John 3:8; Heb. 2:14.</li>
		<li>Satan does not fear when we try to reason with him, but he does fear when we proclaim the spiritual facts of Christ&rsquo;s victory&mdash;cf. 2 Chron. 20:20-22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>That the name of Jesus is above every name is a spiritual fact which we must declare in faith, not only to men but also to Satan&mdash;Phil. 2:9-11; 1 Cor. 12:3b.</li>
			<li>We must proclaim to Satan and his demons that Jesus is Lord, that the Lord is victorious, and that Satan has been crushed under His feet&mdash;Gen. 3:15; John 14:30b; Rom. 16:20.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The word of testimony causes Satan to lose his ground&mdash;James 4:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>They love not their soul-life even unto death:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Due to Adam&rsquo;s fall Satan has joined himself to man&rsquo;s soul-life, man&rsquo;s self; to overcome him we should not love our soul-life but rather hate it and deny it&mdash;Matt. 16:23-24; Luke 14:26; 9:23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Satan wants us to act in our own strength and move in ourselves with the power of our soul, our natural ability.</li>
			<li>Natural ability is that ability which we originally had and which has never been dealt with by the operation of the cross.</li>
			<li>The failure of the church is due to man&rsquo;s bringing in his natural ability.</li>
			<li>The purpose of the cross is to deal with our natural strength and ability so that we will not dare to move by ourselves, as seen in the cases of Moses and Peter&mdash;Acts 7:23-30; Luke 22:32-34; 1 Pet. 5:5-6.</li>
			<li>We should have the attitude that we will not live by our self in any way; we will not value our own ability or have any self-confidence&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2-4; Phil. 3:3; cf. Isa. 11:2b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We must be self-sacrificing persons, a drink offering, allowing Christ as the heavenly wine to fill us and cause us to become wine to God&mdash;Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6; Judg. 9:13.</li>
		</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Firstfruits, the Harvest,<br />
and the Late Overcomers</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 14:1-5, 14-16; 15:2-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The rapture is not mainly for our enjoyment but for God&rsquo;s enjoyment; we need to be raptured to heaven, not for our happiness but for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;12:5, 7-10; 14:1, 4b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The meaning of rapture is to be taken into the Lord&rsquo;s presence; in order to be taken into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we must be in His presence today&mdash;Luke 21:36; 2 Cor. 2:10.</li>
	<li>The rapture is for defeating the enemy and satisfying God&mdash;Rev. 12:5; 14:1, 4b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has a need for us to be raptured; we must be raptured to heaven that we may fight against the enemy&mdash;12:5, 7-11.</li>
		<li>The Lord needs the man-child to fight against His enemy, but He needs the firstfruits even more for His satisfaction&mdash;14:1, 4b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Bible reveals two aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers&mdash;Matt. 24:40-41; Luke 21:36; Rev. 3:10; 1 Thes. 4:15-17; Rev. 12:5; 14:1.</li>
	<li>In Leviticus 23:10 we see a type of the rapture&mdash;the type of the crop ripening in the field&mdash; Matt. 13:24; Rev. 14:14-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reaping of God&rsquo;s crop is what we call the rapture; this reaping indicates that the believers will be taken away from the earth&mdash; Matt. 13:30, 39b.</li>
		<li>Part of the crop&mdash;the firstfruits&mdash;ripens earlier and is reaped earlier; the rest of the crop&mdash;the harvest&mdash;ripens later and is reaped later.</li>
		<li>According to Revelation 14 there are two kinds of rapture&mdash;the rapture of the firstfruits and the rapture of the harvest&mdash;vv. 4b, 14-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5 are the living overcomers who will be the first ripe ones in God&rsquo;s field; hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The firstfruits will be caught up to the heavenly Mount Zion, to the place of God&rsquo;s dwelling in the third heaven, in order to be in the presence of God and Christ&mdash;14:1, 4b.</li>
	<li>The firstfruits are raptured to the house of God in Zion as the fresh enjoyment to God; this is for God&rsquo;s satisfaction&mdash;Exo. 23:19a; Lev. 23:10; cf. John 20:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The firstfruits satisfy the hunger of God the Father and the Lamb, the Redeemer.</li>
		<li>Whereas the man-child is for fighting to deal with the enemy, the firstfruits are for the satisfaction of God and the Lamb.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The firstfruits are believers who are saturated with Christ; they have been fully occupied by Christ and taken over by Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a; Gal. 4:19.</li>
	<li>The firstfruits have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their foreheads; this is the designation of their being one with the Lamb and with the Father and of their belonging to Them&mdash;Rev. 14:1b.</li>
	<li>The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits are believers who are for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;v. 1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The number twelve signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity; this mingling is for the completion of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		<li>Twelve multiplied by twelve means completion of completions, the completion in God&rsquo;s administration for the fulfillment of His economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The firstfruits are the earliest ones among God&rsquo;s crop to reach maturity&mdash;Heb. 5:14&mdash;6:1; 1 Cor. 2:6; Eph. 4:13; Phil. 3:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be transformed is to be changed in our natural life; to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 3:19b.</li>
		<li>For God&rsquo;s expression there is the need of maturity; only a mature life can bear God&rsquo;s image and exercise His dominion&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The harvest in Revelation 14:14-16 is the rapture of the majority of the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whereas the firstfruits are taken to the throne in the heavens before the great tribulation, the harvest is taken to the air (the barn&mdash;Matt. 13:30; 3:12) toward the end of the tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet&mdash;1 Thes. 4:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:52; Rev. 10:7.</li>
	<li>All those included in the rapture of the harvest must pass through the greater part of the great tribulation&mdash;Matt. 24:21; Rev. 3:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The harvest will be left to pass through the great tribulation because green, unripened fields need strong sunshine to ripen&mdash;14:15; Matt. 13:39b.</li>
		<li>In a sense, the great tribulation will be the strong sunshine which will ripen all the believers who were not ready before the tribulation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If today we do not give up the world and live to Christ, Christ will leave us on earth to pass through the great tribulation&mdash;Matt. 16:26; 2 Cor. 5:14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At that time the believers will give up the world and realize that the best way to live is to live to Christ&mdash;James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17; Rom 14:7-8.</li>
		<li>The time will come when all the believers will realize that they need to ripen and mature&mdash; Mark 4:26-29; 1 Cor. 3:1-2; 14:20; Col. 1:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The harvest will be reaped by the Son of Man; He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown&mdash;Matt. 13:37; Rev. 14:14.</li>
	<li>Regarding the rapture, we all need to receive the warning and to see God&rsquo;s purpose and our responsibility to cooperate with Him&mdash;2 Tim. 4:8; Rev. 16:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Revelation 15:2-4 unveils the rapture of the late overcomers, who overcome Antichrist, his mark, the number of his name, and his image:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although they are slain by Antichrist, in the eyes of God they are victorious.</li>
	<li>The late overcomers sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb&mdash;v. 3a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The song of Moses indicates God&rsquo;s triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people&mdash;Exo. 15:1-18.</li>
		<li>The song of the Lamb indicates Christ&rsquo;s redemption experienced by God&rsquo;s people in the presence of their enemy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The late overcomers praise God for His works and His ways, that is, for His acts and His principles&mdash;Rev. 15:3b-4; Psa. 103:7.</li>

Religious Babylon and Material Babylon</h1>

2:18-24; Matt. 13:33</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Revelation 17 is an unveiling of religious Babylon&mdash;the apostate Roman Catholic Church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the eyes of God the Roman Catholic Church, which perpetuates much of Judaism and has assimilated much of paganism, is Babylon.</li>
	<li><em>Mystery</em> in verse 5 indicates that Babylon the Great in chapter seventeen is the apostate church; she is mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.</li>
	<li>The woman in Matthew 13:33 is the Jezebel in Revelation 2:20, and Jezebel becomes the great harlot in 17:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of the apostate church&mdash;1 Kings 16:31.</li>
		<li>The principle of the deeds of the apostate church is to mix the heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people&mdash;Matt. 13:33; Rev. 17:4.</li>
		<li>Jezebel, the apostate church, is a self-appointed prophetess, who presumes to be authorized to speak for God and demands that people listen to her rather than to God&mdash;2:20.</li>
		<li>In the apostate church are &ldquo;the deep things of Satan,&rdquo; the mysterious teachings of Satan&mdash; v. 24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Satan dwells in the apostate church in a subtle way through the teaching of the deep things of Satan.</li>
			<li>The deep thought of Satan has saturated the apostate church, causing it to become the embodiment of Satan.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The harlot in 17:1 is the apostate Roman Catholic Church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fornication of the apostate church consists of her having sinful relationships with the kings of the earth for her profit&mdash;v. 2a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Roman Catholic Church is intimately involved with worldly politics, and the kings of the earth commit fornication directly with her.</li>
			<li>In the eyes of God, this is spiritual fornication.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The &ldquo;wine of her fornication&rdquo; signifies the heretical doctrines of the apostate church in her fornicating relationships with the governments on the earth&mdash;v. 2b.</li>
		<li>The apostate church is in a wilderness, a desert, where there are no springs of water prepared by God&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>The harlot is &ldquo;gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Gold, precious stone, and pearls are the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built&mdash;21:18-19, 21.</li>
			<li>The apostate church is gilded (not solidly built) with these treasures as ornaments for outward display and as a deception intended to entice people.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The harlot has in her hand &ldquo;a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication&rdquo;&mdash;17:4b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Since gold signifies the divine nature, the golden cup indicates that in her outward appearance the apostate church has something of God.</li>
			<li>Her &ldquo;golden cup&rdquo; is full of idolatry, pagan practices, and satanic things.</li>
			<li>The Roman Catholic Church has certain holy things, but she has mixed in many evil and unclean things.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The great harlot is the &ldquo;mother of the harlots&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The harlots, the daughters of the great harlot, are the sects and groups in Christianity that hold to some extent the teachings, practices, and traditions of the apostate church.</li>
			<li>The denominations and groups that still practice some of the great harlot&rsquo;s Babylonian traditions belong in the category of Babylon.</li>
			<li>Only the pure, genuine local churches have no evil transmitted from the great harlot, the apostate church&mdash;1:11-12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because God hates the apostate church, at the beginning of the great tribulation, God will cause Antichrist and his ten kings to destroy the Roman Catholic Church&mdash;17:16-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Revelation 18 is an unveiling of material Babylon&mdash;the city of Rome:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Revelation 17 and 18 two aspects of Babylon&mdash; the religious aspect and the material aspect&mdash; are mixed together:

		<li>The harlot in 17:16 denotes religious Babylon, signifying the Roman Catholic Church, whereas the woman in verse 18 denotes material Babylon, signifying the city of Rome.</li>
		<li>In 18:3 the aspects of religious and material Babylon are both mentioned:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Roman religion makes all nations drunk with her religious, devilish wine.</li>
			<li>The city of Rome enriches the merchants of the earth by the power of her luxury.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Since Babylon the Great is twofold, to come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Material Babylon, the city of Rome, will become hateful in the eyes of God because it has been the source of both devilish politics and devilish religion&mdash;vv. 6-8, 20-24.</li>
	<li>Christ as another Angel will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, with His great authority&mdash;vv. 1-2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Babylon the Great will have two falls&mdash;the fall of religious Babylon and the fall of material Babylon&mdash;14:8; 18:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fall of religious Babylon will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation&mdash;17:16-17.</li>
	<li>The fall of material Babylon will take place at the end of the great tribulation&mdash;18:2, 21.</li>
	<li>The praise in 19:1-4 is related not mainly to the fall of material Babylon but to the fall of religious Babylon, because in the eyes of God religious Babylon is more hateful than material Babylon.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The principle of Babylon (Heb. <em>Babel</em>) is man&rsquo;s endeavor to build up something from earth to heaven by human ability, signified by bricks&mdash; Gen. 11:1-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Stones are made by God, whereas bricks are made by man, being a human invention, a human product.</li>
	<li>Those who live according to the principle of Babylon do not see that they are limited; rather, they attempt to do the Lord&rsquo;s work by their natural ability with their human effort.</li>
	<li>The building of God is not built with man-made bricks by human labor; it is built with God-created and transformed stones and by the divine work&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The principle of Babylon is hypocrisy&mdash;Rev. 17:4, 6; Matt. 23:25-32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The significance of Achan&rsquo;s sin was his coveting a beautiful Babylonian garment in his seeking to improve himself, to make himself look better, for the sake of appearance&mdash;Josh. 7:21.</li>
	<li>This was the sin of Ananias and Sapphira, who lied to the Holy Spirit&mdash;Acts 5:1-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They did not love the Lord very much, but they wanted to be looked upon as those who greatly loved the Lord; they were just pretending.</li>
		<li>They were not willing to offer everything cheerfully to God, but before man, they acted as if they had offered all.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whenever we put on a garment which does not match our actual condition, we are in the principle of Babylon&mdash;Matt. 6:1-6; 15:7-8.</li>
	<li>Everything done in falsehood to receive glory from man is done in the principle of the harlot, not in the principle of the bride&mdash;John 5:44; 12:42-43.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The principle of Babylon is that of not considering herself a widow but of glorifying herself and living luxuriously&mdash;Rev. 18:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Only those who have fallen would consider themselves not to be a widow&mdash;Luke 18:3; Matt. 9:14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband, Christ, is absent from them&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 16:22; Rev. 22:20.</li>
		<li>Because our Beloved is not here in the world, our heart is not here&mdash;cf. Luke 12:34.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Anything in our living which is in excess is luxury and is in the principle of Babylon&mdash;1 Tim. 6:6-10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The principle of Babylon is the principle of a harlot&mdash;Rev. 17:1, 5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Babylon&rsquo;s purpose is for man to make a name for himself and deny God&rsquo;s name&mdash;Gen. 11:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To denominate the church by taking any name other than our Lord&rsquo;s is spiritual fornication&mdash;cf. Rev. 3:8.</li>
		<li>The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ, should have no name other than her Husband&rsquo;s&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2; 1 Cor. 1:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Babylon means confusion&mdash;Gen. 11:6-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the church we should not have different kinds of speaking; we should have only one mind and one mouth under one ministry with one unique teaching for the one Body&mdash;Rom. 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 2:2; 1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>When we are in our mind, we are in the principle of Babylon; when we are in our spirit, we are in today&rsquo;s Jerusalem, in which there is the divine oneness&mdash;John 4:23-24; Eph. 4:3.</li>
		<li>We should not dare to have any division because our Husband is one, and we His wife are also one&mdash;Matt. 19:3-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>With the rebellious people at Babel, there was a scattering&mdash;Gen. 11:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the ancient time all the Israelites came together three times a year at Jerusalem; this was versus the scattering at Babel&mdash;Deut. 12:5; 16:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It was by this unique place of worship to God, Jerusalem, that the oneness of His people was kept for generations&mdash;Psa. 133.</li>
			<li>Jerusalem not only signifies our spirit but also signifies the genuine ground of oneness, the ground of locality&mdash;Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11.</li>
			<li>In order to come out of Babylon, we must be &ldquo;in spirit, on the ground&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #1260).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The sin of Jeroboam, who set up another center of worship, is the sin of division caused by one&rsquo;s ambition to have a kingdom, an empire, to satisfy his selfish desire&mdash;1 Kings 12:26-32.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Babylon is a mixture of the things of God with the things of idols:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon burned the house of God in Jerusalem, carried away all the vessels in God&rsquo;s house for God&rsquo;s worship, and put them in the temple of his idols in Babylon&mdash;2 Chron. 36:6-7; Ezra 1:11.</li>
		<li>In the New Testament, this mixture is enlarged with the great Babylon&mdash;Rev. 17:3-5; cf. 21:18; 22:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s call in the book of Revelation is for His people to come out of Babylon&mdash;18:4-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to God&rsquo;s Word, His children cannot partake of anything that has the character of Babylon&mdash;2 Cor. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>God hates the principle of Babylon more than anything else&mdash;Rev. 11:18b; 18:24; 19:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Anything which is halfway and not absolute is called Babylon.</li>
		<li>We need God to enlighten us so that in His light we may judge everything in us which is not absolute toward Him&mdash;3:16-19.</li>
		<li>Only when we judge ourselves in this way can we confess that we too hate the principle of Babylon&mdash;cf. Rev. 2:6.</li>
		<li>By His grace, may the Lord not allow us to seek any glory and honor outside of Christ&mdash; John 7:18; 12:26; Phil. 1:19-21a; cf. Exo. 28:2.</li>
		<li>The Lord requires that we delight and seek to be ones who are absolute, not ones who are living in the principle of Babylon.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When God judges the harlot and shatters all her work, and when He casts out all that she is and the principle she represents, voices from heaven will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. 19:1-4.</li>

Matt. 22:1-2, 11-14; Psa. 45:13-14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His judicial redemption and by His organic salvation in His divine life&mdash;Gen. 2:22; Rom. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the past, Christ as the Redeemer gave Himself up for the church for redemption and the impartation of life&mdash;Eph. 5:25; John 19:34.</li>
		<li>In the present, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church by the washing of the water in the word&mdash;Eph. 5:26.</li>
		<li>In the future, Christ as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction&mdash;v. 27; S. S. 8:13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The marriage of the Lamb and the reign of God, the kingdom of God, will take place after the destruction of Babylon the Great, the great harlot&mdash;Rev. 19:1-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the reason the great multitude of the saved rejoice and praise with hallelujahs (vv. 1, 3, 6), and the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures join them in praising God (v. 4).</li>
		<li>The wedding will bring in the reign of the Lord, the kingdom, because all the guests invited to the wedding will be both the corporate bride and the co-kings of the Bridegroom&mdash;20:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The marriage of the Lamb will come after the rapture of the majority of the believers&mdash;1 Thes. 4:15-17.</li>
	<li>The marriage of the Lamb will also follow the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we are rewarded at the judgment seat of Christ, we will participate in the wedding feast; the guests will be the corporate bride.</li>
		<li>If we are not rewarded but are disapproved of by the Lord, we will not perish; yet we will suffer a loss like that described in 1 Corinthians 3:15.</li>
		<li>According to Matthew 25:1-13, the five prudent virgins will be admitted to the wedding feast, and the five foolish ones will be rejected.</li>
		<li>After the judgment seat of Christ, which will be set up in the air, and after the wedding, Christ will descend with His chosen ones as His army to fight against Antichrist in the war at Armageddon&mdash;Rev. 19:11-21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The wife, the bride of Christ, in Revelation 19:7-9 consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The readiness of the corporate bride depends upon the maturity in life of the overcomers&mdash; Rev. 19:7; Heb. 6:1; Phil. 3:12-15; Eph. 4:13.</li>
		<li>We need to adorn and consummate the New Jerusalem as the bride of Christ with God the Father as the gold, God the Son as the pearl, and God the Spirit as the precious stones&mdash; Rev. 21:2, 19a; 1 Cor. 3:12; S. S. 1:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ lived out of the saints as their subjective righteousness becomes their wedding garment&mdash; Rev. 19:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God (1 Cor. 1:30), whereas the righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective (Phil. 3:9) and enable them to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ.</li>
	<li>The second garment, the wedding garment referred to in Matthew 22:11-13, is the Christ whom we live out and who is expressed through us in our daily living as our surpassing righteousness&mdash;5:20; Rev. 3:4-5, 18.</li>
	<li>The wedding garment is typified by the raiment of embroidery in Psalm 45:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At the time of our salvation, we received a golden garment that enabled us to be in the presence of God&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>Only those who have the second garment produced by the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit will be chosen and qualified to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb&mdash;v. 14; Matt. 22:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The marriage dinner of the Lamb is the wedding feast, the kingdom of one thousand years, which is one day in the eyes of God, as a reward to the overcoming believers&mdash;Rev. 19:9; Matt. 22:2, 11-14; 2 Pet. 3:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be called to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed&mdash; Rev. 19:9.</li>
	<li>Eating and drinking Christ in order that we may feast on Christ is the central thought in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The beginning of the Christian life is a feast:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord Jesus likens the gospel of God&rsquo;s full salvation to a great dinner&mdash;Luke 14:16-23.</li>
			<li>The penitent sinner is not only clothed with Christ the Son as the God-satisfying righteousness to judicially redeem him but is also brought to the Father&rsquo;s house to feast on the rich Christ to organically save him&mdash;15:22-23; 1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 3:8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The continuation of the Christian life is a feast:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Christian life continues with the Lord&rsquo;s table until He comes&mdash;1 Cor. 11:26.</li>
			<li>The divine concept is that to remember the Lord is simply to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him&mdash;vv. 24-26.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s table is a weekly proclamation, a declaration to the whole universe, that we daily enjoy Christ as our food and drink.</li>
			<li>Even while we are fighting on the battlefield, the Lord prepares a table for us in the presence of our adversaries for us to feast on Him&mdash;Psa. 23:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The consummation of the Christian life is a feast:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The overcoming believers will feast on a special portion of the unsearchably rich Christ at the marriage dinner of the Lamb for one thousand years&mdash;Rev. 19:9; Matt. 26:29; Luke 22:30; 13:29.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Spiritual warfare is necessary because Satan&rsquo;s will is set against God&rsquo;s will&mdash;Matt. 6:10; 7:21; Isa. 14:12-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we would know how the church can be God&rsquo;s warrior to engage in spiritual warfare, we need to realize that in the universe there are three wills&mdash;the divine will, the satanic will, and the human will:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Spiritual warfare has its source in the conflict between the divine will and the satanic will.</li>
		<li>God wants His creature <em>man</em> to deal with His fallen creature <em>Satan;</em> for this, the human will must stand with the divine will&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Matt. 26:39; 12:30; 7:21.</li>
		<li>As the church, our fighting is to subdue the satanic will and to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;Rev. 12:11.</li>

	<li>The purpose of spiritual warfare is to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Rev. 12:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Spiritual warfare is the warfare between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan&mdash; Matt. 12:26, 28.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God is the exercise of the divine will and the overthrowing of the power of Satan by the power of God&mdash;6:10; 12:28:

<li>Revelation 12 presents a great vision concerning the war in heaven&mdash;the warfare in the universe between God and His enemy:

	<li>The vision in this chapter unveils the true situation in the universe&mdash;the view that God&rsquo;s enemy is fighting against Him&mdash;vv. 1-4, 7-9, 13, 17:

		<li>For us to know God&rsquo;s economy, we need to see the spiritual things behind the physical things, the spiritual world behind the physical world&mdash;Dan. 10:12-13, 20-21.</li>
		<li>It is crucial for us to see that behind the physical scene a spiritual struggle, a struggle not seen with human eyes, is taking place.</li>
		<li>In our fighting we deal not with things that appear on the surface but with the power of darkness behind these things&mdash;Eph. 2:6; 6:12; S. S. 4:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Among the many crucial matters in the second section of Revelation is the vision of the universal bright woman with her man-child fighting against the dragon&mdash;12:1-4:

		<li>War is raging between the dragon and the woman, who symbolizes God&rsquo;s people and represents God.</li>
		<li>We all need to be aware of the warfare between the dragon and the woman; this vision must become a governing vision to us&mdash;Prov. 29:18a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The battle is fought by the man-child, the stronger part within the woman, who bears the responsibility to fight against the enemy&mdash; Rev. 12:4-5, 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcomers fight against Satan continually, even unto death, and defeat him on earth; however, heaven is still waiting for them to arrive there that war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven&mdash;vv. 5, 7-11.</li>
		<li>The part of the church which will be the man-child to fight against the enemy in the heavens will also be the army to fight against Satan on earth&mdash;19:14; 17:14.</li>
		<li>We should begin now to be qualified, equipped, and perfected to be among those who will be raptured to execute God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan.</li>

	<li>When Christ comes with His army to fight against Antichrist and his armies, He will come as the Son of Man&mdash;Matt. 26:64; Rev. 14:14:

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the divine economy&mdash;Rev. 21:2; 1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10:

	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen, predestinated, and redeemed people as their life, their life supply, and their everything to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5, 7-10, 13-14, 22-23; Rev. 21:10.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to make man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead and to make Himself one with man and man one with Him, thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression, that all His divine attributes may be expressed in human virtues.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy and goal according to His heart&rsquo;s desire are to build Himself into our being and to build us into His being in order to mingle His divinity with our humanity into one entity&mdash; the Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 1:9-10, 22-23; 3:17a; John 14:20; Rev. 3:12.</li>

<li>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the divine building&mdash;Exo. 25:8; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; Rev. 21:2, 10-23:

		</ol></li>
	<li>As the consummation of the divine building, the New Jerusalem is a mutual abode produced by the building of divinity into humanity and of humanity into divinity&mdash;John 15:4a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The New Jerusalem is built by God&rsquo;s constituting Himself into man to make man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead so that God and man may become a corporate entity&mdash;Rev. 21:18-21:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All the components have the same life, nature, and composition and thus are a corporate person.</li>
			<li>God and man, man and God, are united, mingled, and incorporated together; this is the consummation of God&rsquo;s building.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is a constitution of God and man and man and God, who are constituted into one to become a mutual dwelling place&mdash;vv. 3, 22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The One who is God yet man dwells in the one who is man yet God, and the one who is man yet God dwells in the One who is God yet man.</li>
			<li>This mutual dwelling place is divinity expressed in humanity and humanity glorified in divinity, with the divine glory shining forth with great splendor radiantly in humanity&mdash;vv. 11, 23.</li>

		<li>The New Jerusalem will be a corporate Shulammite, including all of God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people.</li>

		<li>The marriage life will be in the New Jerusalem for eternity&mdash;21:2, 9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>According to its humanity the New Jerusalem is the human wife (with the divine life and nature) of the Lamb, and according to its divinity the New Jerusalem is the divine Husband (the redeeming God in His consummated embodiment, Christ, with His human life and nature) of God&rsquo;s redeemed elect.</li>
	<li>Revelation 22:17 indicates that Christ and the New Jerusalem as His wife will be a universal couple for eternity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride&mdash;21:2, 9-10.</li>
		<li>The consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God and the consummation of God&rsquo;s regenerated, transformed, and glorified people will be a universal couple expressing the Triune God for eternity&mdash; vv. 11, 23.</li>
