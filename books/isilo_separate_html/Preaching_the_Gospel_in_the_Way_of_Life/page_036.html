First, we must learn that the preaching of the gospel is a matter not merely of individuals. It is a matter of the Body. In verse 5 the apostle Paul uses the word fellowship, speaking of the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel. If this were a matter of individuals only, there would be no need for fellowship. The move of the preaching of the gospel must be a matter in fellowship, because it is a matter of the Body.<p>John 15 tells us that all the branches bear fruit (vv. 1-5). A tree has not only one branch; it has many branches, and all the branches bear fruit in a way of fellowship. This is why later in that chapter the Lord Jesus tells us that we have to love one another (vv. 12, 17). If we love one another, the people of the world will see that we are the disciples of Christ (13:34-35). If we preach Christ yet do not have fellowship and do not love one another, our fruit will be very limited; we will not be very fruitful. In order to be fruitful, we have to love one another. This is the strongest testimony to the unbelievers.<p>All people deep within are seeking a life and love in real mutuality. This desire for mutuality is in the human nature as something created by God. Not one human being truly wants to live by himself or herself individually. However, because of the damage done by the evil one, there is no real mutuality among humanity and in human society. There is no mutuality in life, in love, in truth, and in sincerity. If we Christian brothers, however, live together in pure love and sincerity, this will become a strong testimony. This sincere, pure love lived out by us is the very life of Christ. This love is Christ expressed through us. When we live by Christ, in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ, we have love for one another, and this mutual love becomes a strong testimony. This is the outworking of the inner life and the power to bear fruit.<p>In order to be prevailing and fruitful in the preaching of the gospel, we must pay our full attention to the Body life. The more we live in the Body life and have the reality of the Body life, the more we will be fruitful. Such a life will be a strong testimony to our relatives, friends, schoolmates, and neighbors. When all these people see the kind of mutual love we have among us as Christian brothers, they will be very impressed and influenced. This will pave the way and open the door for the Holy Spirit to work in their hearts. To have the real Body life helps us to be prevailing. I believe that this is the very reason why the apostle Paul uses the word fellowship in Philippians 1:5. All the branches bear fruit together, one with another. Not one branch bears fruit individually.<p>In preaching the gospel, we have to learn the Body life. By this kind of preaching we will be built up together more and more. If we are burdened for a neighbor, we will ask some brothers to help us bring this neighbor to the Lord. If we are burdened for a classmate, we will ask some others to help us bring this classmate to the Lord. We will work not just by ourselves, but we will invite the brothers to work together with us in a way of coordination. I say again, if we have the spirit of the Body life, people will sense it. If we have love among us, people around us will sense what we have, and that love and living will be a very strong factor to convince the unbelievers-our neighbors and friends-to open their spirits to the Lord. We need the Body life, and the best way to be built up together is for us to have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel.<p>It may be hard to bring a certain relative to the Lord, but we can invite him to our home and on the same night also invite three or four brothers and sisters. Then we can work together on this relative. However, this must not be merely an outward activity. If we do not have the mutual love and the reality of the Body life, even if we invite three or four to come, they will bring only coldness. They will not bring warmth, and there will be no reality. If on the other hand, we are in the Body life and we have the reality, nothing will be able to conceal that reality. When three or four brothers and sisters come to our home, there will be the influence; there will be something that warms people. People will realize that among these Christians there is something very special, something quite attractive. We must have this kind of love.<p>The more we go on to have the preaching of the gospel, the more we will be built up together. We will be thoroughly joined and knit together. This will be a strong testimony, not only to man but also to the principalities and powers in the heavens. This will be a shame to them. We need to learn how to preach the gospel in the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel in the Body life. This too is neglected by today&#8217;s Christianity. Many Christians today think that to preach the gospel is a matter of the individual. Someone may say, &#8220;Since I love the Lord, I preach the gospel. That is good enough.&#8221; This kind of preaching can be prevailing to some extent, but the most prevailing and fruitful way to work in the gospel is to have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel, to preach the gospel by the Body life and in the Body life.<p>All the souls, the unbelievers, are still usurped by the principalities and powers in the heavens. Those powers would not give up anyone, so we must fight a battle, not by ourselves individually but by keeping the fellowship in the Body life. How fruitful we are in our preaching depends on how much of the reality of the Body we have. According to Philippians, the genuine, fruitful, and prevailing preaching of the gospel is a kind of fellowship. We have to do the preaching in the Body. If we are out of the Body, we cannot fight the battle, because we are disarmed. We must have the Body. Try it; then you will prove that this is the case.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
