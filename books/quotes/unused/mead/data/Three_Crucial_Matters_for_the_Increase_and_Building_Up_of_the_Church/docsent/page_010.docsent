   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAYING THE PRICE IN OUR LIVING TO GAIN OIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must pay a price in order to gain oil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we fellowship with the Lord in the morning, He may touch our conscience, telling us to deal with our sins against others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we obey Him, we are inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the first step in buying oil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the day we must also live a life of buying oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we read the Bible and pray, we are buying oil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we preach the gospel, we are buying oil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we attend home meetings, we are buying oil, and when we teach Truth Lessons, we are buying even more oil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot borrow oil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This can be compared to eating and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can eat or breathe for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord comes, we will be unable to borrow oil from the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we fellowship with the Lord when we are at home, we will have oil when we speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will supply the saints, and our prayers will cause them to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we watch television instead of enjoying the Lord, our prayer in the home meetings will be without oil, and we will not supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus gave us a principle: Whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him Luke 8:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we spend one and a half hours contacting the Lord every Saturday, our speaking in the home meetings will be full of oil and everyone will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we are using the riches that the Lord gave us, we will feel that there is more oil flowing into us than there is flowing out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We supply others, and they supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone gains something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the church is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When each member fulfills his function, the meetings are fresh, living, strong, and bright, and they can attract, supply, support, and gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE INCREASE AND BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>DEPENDING ON THOSE WHO HAVE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be people with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must have oil when we preach the gospel, meet in the home meetings, and teach Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have oil, we will not need many words when we speak to the unbelievers who come to our home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will be able to open their hearts with a simple prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we lack oil, we will be unable to speak when an unbeliever comes to our home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of what we serve as refreshments, they will not want to come again, because they were not supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>People today want and need oil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we lead people to diligently read Truth Lessons, they will receive it, and they will spontaneously enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the classes on Truth Lessons, we must lead the saints to read each lesson, but we should not explain too much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The classes should be small, and we should fellowship after reading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the saints cannot digest the text, they should take it home and read it again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do this faithfully for fifty-two weeks every year, the lessons will become the riches within the saints that they can apply, and they will have oil when they preach the gospel, meet in the home meetings, and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through such a practice the church will be built up, the number of believers will increase, and those who are cold and backslidden will begin meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church will spontaneously multiply and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regrettably, some brothers and sisters still emphasize the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the home meetings there are children, young people, and old people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There might be only ten people in the meeting and not one of them is talented.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They do not know how to speak eloquently, and they sing out of tune.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason that some people do not want to attend the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They consider the big meetings to be better.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the people gained in the big meetings are not as stable as the people gained through the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who are saved in the big meetings do not know anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the meeting ends, everyone is dismissed, and there is no solid contact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If two home meetings save one person every week, the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei will have two hundred new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two hundred new ones are the personal contacts of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, they will be stable and more likely to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every home meeting has approximately seven or eight people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we say that Taipei has four hundred home meetings, we mean that more than three thousand people are actively meeting in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This may seem insignificant, but it is more effective than a big meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Any society that relies only on outward show cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The practice in modern society is to encourage stable families.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way society has a proper structure and can be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This also applies to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not practical for the church to have big meetings every day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The most practical way is for everyone to meet in the homes to supply and care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>DILIGENTLY BEGETTING, NOURISHING,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>AND TEACHING EVERY DAY</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must diligently read the Bible, pray, visit others, preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot be lazy in any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should never think that we can be loose because the Lord has not come for two thousand years, even though He said that He comes quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though He delays, we will meet Him one day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must be prepared to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We cannot prepare in one day; we need a lifetime to prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot wait until we are about to die before we prepare to settle accounts with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must prepare daily.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The brothers who have gone before us are patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They spent their entire lives preparing to meet the Lord because they feared that they would not be ready when the Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are now in the age of grace, and our salvation is eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After the age of grace is the age of the kingdom of righteousness, in which the Lord will settle accounts with us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We will either be rewarded or punished for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are considering this serious matter in order to encourage everyone to diligently and faithfully participate in begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our preparing to meet the Lord can be compared to saving money in a bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not save all our money in one day; instead, we save our money gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must daily seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit, deal with our sins, and have proper fellowship with the Lord so that we mature in life and our work is accepted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do these things, we will be rewarded at the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will participate in His wedding feast, partake of His joy, enter into the kingdom, and reign together with Him.</S>
