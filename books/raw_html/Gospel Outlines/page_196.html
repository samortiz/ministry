FOR THE UNRIGHTEOUS ONES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Pet. 3:18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Jesus is the righteous One
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus is God coming as man.</li>
	<li>Jesus was born in holiness without the nature of sin.</li>
	<li>Jesus has never committed sin. Once He asked publicly, &ldquo;Who among you can prove that I have sinned?&rdquo; When He was examined before His crucifixion, no one could find sin in Him.</li>
	<li>Jesus is the sinless and the righteous One.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are the unrighteous ones
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are sinners.</li>
	<li>We were born in sin.</li>
	<li>We have committed sins and grew up in sin.</li>
	<li>We are altogether, one hundred percent sinners.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The righteous One substituted for the unrighteous ones
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The righteous One substituted Himself for the unrighteous ones; that is, the Lord Jesus substituted Himself for us.</li>
	<li>On the cross the Lord Jesus became our substitute by bearing our sins, shedding His blood, and dying for us.</li>
	<li>Because He bore our sins and died for us on the cross, our sins are forgiven before God. Because He died for us, we can be delivered from death and can obtain eternal life.</li>

<li>How to partake of Jesus&rsquo; substitution<br />
