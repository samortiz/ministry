   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING IN CHRIST, CHRIST BEING THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since life is God Himself, how can man touch and obtain life so that this life can come into him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of the disciples made a very interesting request of the Lord Jesus, saying, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us John 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that they knew of God the Father but had never seen or touched Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was He fat or thin?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Was He tall or short?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What exactly did He look like, and what was His content and disposition?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The disciples had no clue and were puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had heard of the Father, but they had never seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, they asked the Lord to show them the Father, and they would be content.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord answered, saying, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the Lord is the Father, and the Father is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This can be compared to a person asking someone to show him what rice grains look like, even though he eats rice every day; this is very odd.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Me in the Father is in Me is the Christ who is the incarnated Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that the Father is in Him, and then He said that He would leave the disciples in a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the Father is in Him, He did not want the disciples to treasure this and hold on to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord told the disciples that they should not let their heart be troubled or be afraid, because He would leave them in a little while but would come again vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>18-19, 27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He came as the Spirit, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him v. 17 . This shows that God is in Christ, and Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit has a very special name; He is called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , which means that the Spirit gives life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 6:63 says that the words that the Lord speaks are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of us may be confused and feel that I am speaking in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We started speaking concerning life, and now we are speaking about the Spirit; it seems that speaking of life, God, Christ, and the Spirit is just like going around in a circle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the Spirit is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, life is God, God is in Christ, Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LIFE BEING IN THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>AND LIGHT BEING IN GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where is life?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Life is in those who believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is absolutely true, but how does life enter into man?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to see that life is the light of man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 36:9 says, For with You is the fountain of life; / In Your light we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please remember, life is in the light, and this life is the light of man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wherever the light shines, life comes in. Wherever life comes, the Spirit is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever the Spirit is, Christ is there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wherever Christ is, God is there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Wherever God is, life is there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where is the light?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The light is in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The words that the Lord speaks to us are spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We minister God s word because we hope that God s word will enter into everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as God s word enters into man, it becomes light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as we receive light inwardly, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When light is received by man, it becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover, life is the Spirit, the Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not a theory but a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone who has experienced this will bow in worship and say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we touch the Lord s word, the word becomes light in us, and the word becomes life to satisfy our hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We feel that we are eating of the fatness and drinking of the river of His pleasures, and we are full of God s presence, full of Christ s supply, and filled with the Triune God inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, when God s word operates and starts to have an effect on us and if we willingly obey, we are immediately filled with light, life, the Spirit s presence, Christ, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way, people sense God, Christ, the Spirit, life, light, and God s word in us when they contact us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should always remember that life is God, God is in Christ, Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is life, life is light, and light comes from God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>OBEYING GOD S SPEAKING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we fellowship with the Lord in the morning, we may sometimes get a sense of receiving a word from God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes the word seems tangible, and it speaks clearly in us; sometimes the word seems more intangible, as if it is just a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Regardless of its form, it is God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as we receive such a word inwardly, we immediately have light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This light is the moving of the Spirit, and it issues in the filling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way, we inwardly sense God, Christ, and the Spirit, and we are inwardly filled with life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When people contact us, they have the sense that they are touching God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, whether or not we can touch, contact, and obtain life all depends on how we handle God s word and how we contact God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Often there is a word of God in us; it is the speaking through the moving of the Spirit in us, and its purpose is for us to contact and touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But how do we handle this word?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people listen to messages, but they do not touch God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people read the Bible, but they do not hear God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some people read spiritual books, but they never touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is because they disobey, ignore, and even reason and argue with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the reason that their light is lost and the reason that life and Christ disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is true not only in our daily living; we frequently have this kind of experience in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the Spirit in us gives us a word or a feeling to open our mouth and praise the Lord, we should receive this word and open our mouth to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus, we will have light within, and this light is life, the Spirit, Christ, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we respond to this feeling and offer a prayer of praise to the Lord, we sense the satisfaction of life, the sweetness of Christ, the presence of God, and the moving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even after we go home, we will still sense God s sweet presence inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Regrettably, many people have a feeling, a word without form, but they are not willing to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead, they reason inwardly, thinking, The Lord wants me to get up to praise and pray, but if my prayer is not good, I will lose face and become a laughingstock.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As they begin to reason, the light in them disappears, and life, Christ, and God also disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As a result, they inwardly feel empty and unsatisfied in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When they go home, they are still empty within and cannot touch God, and they go to sleep with this empty feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When they get up the next morning, they feel that God is far away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Their inward fellowship will not be restored until they confess before God: O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On that day You gave me a word in the bread-breaking meeting, but I did not obey You.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Thus, if we want to touch life, we need the word, the feeling given to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Such a feeling is the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although it is silent, it is indeed a living word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should accept and obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we do this, the word in us will become light.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This light is life, Christ, God, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we would all practice in this way, we could touch God every day.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the way for us to touch God, and whoever touches God in this way is blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>To be blessed is to have God s life as a spiritual reality.</S>
