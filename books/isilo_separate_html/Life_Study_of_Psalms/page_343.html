He Having Created Heaven, Earth, and All Things</H2><P>Verse 6 says that Jehovah made heaven, earth, and the sea and all things in them and that He keeps faith forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. He Taking Care of the Needy Ones</H2><P>Verses 7 and 8 tell us that Jehovah executes judgment for the oppressed, gives food to the famished, frees the prisoners, opens the eyes of the blind, raises up those who are bowed down, and loves the righteous. According to verse 9, He also preserves the sojourners and upholds the orphan and the widow, but He subverts the way of the wicked.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. He Reigning Forever and Ever</H2><P>Verse 10 concludes with the declaration that Jehovah will reign forever and ever.</P><P>Psalm 146 is a good psalm. However, the writer still held to the principle of good and evil and wrote according to the knowledge of good and evil. Here we do not see anything concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. We need to see that today Christ is the Spirit in our spirit and that the grace of Christ also is in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. PRAISING JEHOVAH<br>FOR THE REBUILDING OF JERUSALEM</H2><P>Psalm 147 is on praising Jehovah for the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Verse 2a says, "Jehovah builds up Jerusalem."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. He Gathering the Outcasts of Israel</H2><P>Jehovah gathers the outcasts of Israel. This gathering of the outcasts is the release of the captives to bring them back to Jerusalem for the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Jehovah also heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He restores the afflicted and brings the wicked, the Babylonians and Persians as the captors of the outcasts, down to the ground (vv. 2b-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. He Providing Food for the Beast and the Birds<br>and Taking Pleasure in Those Who Fear Him<br>and Hope in His Lovingkindness</H2><P>Jehovah provides food for the beast and the birds (v. 9). He takes no delight in the strength of horses, nor pleasure in the legs of man, but He "takes pleasure in those who fear Him,/In those who hope in His lovingkindness" (vv. 10-11).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_342.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_344.html">Next</a> </body></html>
