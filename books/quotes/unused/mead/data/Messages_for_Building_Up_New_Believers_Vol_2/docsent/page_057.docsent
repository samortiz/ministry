   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE CHRISTIAN WAY OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian way of managing money is not to hold on to money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tighter you hold on to your money, the more it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more you grasp it, the more it disappears; it will evaporate like vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the more you give away, the more you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If God s children would learn to give more, God would have many ways to work out His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Keeping back money only makes God s children poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God will not entrust Himself to those who hold on to their money and who will not give.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more you give, the more God will give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Sowing with One s Money</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please read 2 Corinthians 9:6, which says, He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is also a scriptural principle of financial management.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christians give, they are not throwing their money away; they are sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Word does not say, He who throws away his money sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who throws away his money with blessings shall also with blessings reap.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It says, He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you give, you are sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you want your money to grow?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do, you need to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you give your money away, it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you do not give it away, it does not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, can anyone be so foolish as to expect a harvest without sowing?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How many times has God not answered your prayer for your needs?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are a hard man, trying to reap where you have not sown and gather where you have not winnowed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why do you not sow some of your money?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many brothers and sisters who are in difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why do you not sow money upon them so that you may reap when the reaping time comes?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more a person holds on to his money, the less he will have.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the above portion of the Word, we see a very beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Corinthians gave to those in Jerusalem, remembering their needs, and Paul said that it was a kind of sowing, not a kind of throwing away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please remember that money can be our seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you see a brother or sister in difficulty, and you remember him or her, God will cause that money to grow and harvest thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and even a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that more of your money will be sown.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A new believer should learn to sow, so that when he has needs, he can reap what he has sown.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You cannot reap what you have not sown.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many brothers who are getting poorer and poorer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you eat what you have, of course, there will not be anything left.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if you keep half of your seed for sowing, you will have a harvest next year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If next year you also keep half for planting, you will have another harvest the following year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you want to sow anything, you must not eat all that you have.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people always eat and never sow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They also never receive anything when they are in need.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose some young brothers sow some money upon other brothers, praying as they sow, O God, I have sown upon the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I have needs, I want to harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they do this, God will honor His own words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. Offering to God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Old Testament, God said to the Israelites, Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it Mal 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here we see the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time, the Israelites were in great poverty and difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How could they carry out the words of Malachi 3:10?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Israelites might have asked, If we cannot get by with ten loads of rice, how can we get by with nine?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If ten bags of flour are insufficient, how can nine bags be sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These are words out of a carnal and foolish mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God reproached the people and told them that what is impossible with man is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He seemed to be saying, Bring to My storehouse, and test Me if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing that there shall not be enough room to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ten loads are the reason for poverty, while nine loads are the cause for abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man thinks that the more he has in his hand, the better off he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, keeping things in one s hand is the very cause for poverty, while offering things to God is the very cause for blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I have an additional load in my hands, it will become my curse.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if it is put in God s storehouse, it becomes my blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The principle with the Israelites was poverty for those who tried to hold back what was due to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you hold something back, you end up in poverty.</S>
