<P>Because we are on this earth, we are limited by time and space, and we have many business affairs. The saints in Anaheim and the saints in San Francisco and Fresno cannot meet together often. This is impossible because of the inconvenience of distance. They need to have their own particular activities. The church in Fresno may decide to rent a small hall, whereas the church in Anaheim meets in a big hall. This is altogether according to the practical need. But this does not indicate any division, separation, or independence.</P><P>When all the churches come together for a conference, those who are coming from another city may not function in the conference. They may think, "This is not my home church." As a result, they would not function. But certain brothers who live in the locality where the conference is held may function frequently because they think, "This is my home church." Dear saints, this is wrong. The Lord has only one Body. The church of God is only one. In 1 Corinthians 10:32 Paul spoke of three categories of people on this earth: the Jews, God's chosen people; the Greeks, the unbelieving Gentiles; and the church of God, a composition of the believers in Christ. The church is uniquely one on this earth. If I go to London, I should not consider that I am from the United States and that this is their church. I should not consider that I am a guest and they are the host, that they have their jurisdiction and that I have no concern in the church there. This is wrong. I should consider that I am a member of the church of God, which is universal and sometimes local. It is okay to say sometimes but not all times.</P><P>Two thousand years ago, the communication and the means of travel were not as convenient as they are today. Even fifty years ago, it took me forty-eight hours to travel by boat from my home town, Chefoo, to Shanghai. Later, after World War II it took only forty-five minutes to travel this distance by plane. Today the world has become so small. I am so glad that the world situation is tending this way. This is for our experience of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ. How can we keep ourselves independent and keep our so-called jurisdiction, saying, "This is my city. This is my country. This is my region"? In today's world and in today's recovery, we cannot and should not do this.</P><P>In 1963 I told the saints that the international trade and commerce would turn from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This is why I chose Los Angeles to be my place for the Lord's ministry. Now we can see that there is much more traffic for commerce on the Pacific than on the Atlantic. The world has changed, so we should not keep ourselves in a backward state. If we are going to have the Lord's blessing, we must be one in all the parts of the recovery.</P><P>The Lord Jesus prayed for this in John 17. He prayed to the Father, "That they may be one even as We are" (vv. 11, 21). We should keep the oneness. If we are narrow, independent, and insisting on our jurisdiction in our locality, we will not even be able to be in one accord with others in our locality. Universally, we should be one. Locally, we should be in one accord. Are you expecting to see the Lord's blessing? You must learn the "two-layer lesson." Locally, you must serve with the saints in one accord. Universally, all the churches should be one.</P><P>Today's problems in the Lord's recovery are all due to one thing&#151;we have not seen the Body. If we have seen the Body, there is no problem. Then minor things such as whether we use leavened or unleavened bread and wine or grape juice at the Lord's table will not matter. As long as we receive the threefold dispensing of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, everything is okay. As long as we would stay under the transmission of the transcending Christ from the heavens, everything is okay.</P>
