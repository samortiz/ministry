Beginning from tonight they will be more systematic. I hope that in the next few days, I can impress you deeply with the matter of being in Christ. The words in Christ are very simple, but their significance is profound. Without being in Christ, there is no gospel and there is no church. If there is not such a thing as being in Christ, there is not even Christianity, and there is certainly no redemption and salvation. Everything that God has done is done in Christ and not in man. Everything that God has accomplished within us is done in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD NOT DEALING WITH INDIVIDUALS</h2><p>Tonight is an introductory word. Following this, every evening we will see a little more about being in Christ. Ephesians 1:3 says that God "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." We may think that God is redundant and cumbersome by adding the words "in Christ" after the words "every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies." It seems unnecessary to do this. Why does God's Word say this? If we understand this, we will understand Christianity. We also will understand God's plan of redemption and how His work is accomplished in the Bible. In God's plan of redemption, He does not deal with man individually. The Bible shows us that God does not deal with the world as individuals, but as a corporate whole. God does not ask how many sins and evils you have committed. He only asks if you are in Adam. Man pays attention to individual sins, but God has included the world in one man&mdash;Adam. We can find out what we are from this man. If he did not have a problem, we would not have any problem, and if he has a problem, we have a problem, because we are in him.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING ONLY TWO MEN IN THE EYES OF GOD</h2><p>According to the principle of the Scripture, there are only two men in the world. The Bible says that Adam was the first man&mdash;the first Adam. Christ is the second man&mdash;the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Some may ask, "What about all the men who were between these two men? There are obviously many men in this world. Why does the Bible only speak of two men?" This is because in God's eyes everyone is included in these two men. Other than these two men, there is not a third man; there is no other man. You are either in Adam or in Christ. Adam is like a big man. Once you are born, you are born into this big Adam, and when you believe in the Lord and are regenerated, you are transferred into Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ADAM</h2><p>I once saw a picture of a woman with a big skirt and under her skirt were many small children. God views us the same way. We are human beings in Adam. God has put the whole human race into Adam. We can include the children in the parents, and the parents in the grandparents. Each successive generation is included in the preceding generation. This goes on all the way back to Adam. In this way we see that everyone is in Adam. Today we see that we come from Adam. Strictly speaking, we are still in Adam. Whatever Adam did on that day, we did the same. When Adam and Eve sinned in the garden of Eden, we sinned as well. What Adam did we also did.</p><p>What does it mean to be in Adam? I can explain this with an illustration. When I was in Kaifeng, a person asked me what it means to be in Adam and asked me to give him an illustration. I answered, "The Chinese say that our ancestor is Hwang-ti. Once Hwang-ti fought with Tzi-you and killed him. Suppose at that time that Tzi-you was not killed, but that Hwang-ti had been killed instead. If that had happened, would there still be the Chinese race today?" He answered, "Of course not." I said, "Why would there no longer be a Chinese race when Hwang-ti died?" He answered, "Because if Hwang-ti had died, we would have all died." I argued, "Hwang-ti's death was his business. Our life has nothing to do with him!" He said, "No. We all came from Hwang-ti. If Hwang-ti had died, we all would have died as well." Have you seen this? Tzi-you would not need to kill all of us. All he would have to do would be to kill Hwang-ti, and all of us who come after him would be gone. This is the way the Bible sees Adam. We do not have to commit sins in ourselves. Everyone who is born of Adam has sinned. Adam's experience is our experience. First Corinthians 15 says that in Adam we all died. When Adam died, the whole world died with him. You do not need to search your personal history. As long as you are in Adam, his experience has become your history.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
