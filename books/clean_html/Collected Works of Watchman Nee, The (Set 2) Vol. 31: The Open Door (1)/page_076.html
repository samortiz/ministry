<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brothers Lan,</p><p> Chou, Hu, and Chu:</p><p>Two months have passed quickly since I left you in Hankow. First, I went to Wu-Hu and stayed in the hostel for missionaries of the China Inland Mission. Later, I went to Yun-Chao. I then took a boat through Wu-Wei County to Lu-Jiang County. On February 10 I left Lu-Jiang County and went to Tung-Cheng. Lu-Jiang County is about thirty miles from Tung-Cheng, and we came by wagon. May the Lord lead me. The China Inland Mission is in this area. If the Lord is willing, I may leave Tung-Cheng next month and go somewhere else. I still have not decided where I will go. Perhaps I will return to Hankow. Our life and travels are all in the Lord's hands. Please pray much for me. Please pray for my family, too, because I cannot communicate with them now and do not know how they are doing. Greet all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Dai En-tsao<br />February 18</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received and read The Open Door and got to know the condition of the brothers and sisters in each locality, thank the Lord! I have been in Ying-Shang for more than a month now. During the Chinese New Year, there is a gospel meeting for women in the China Inland Mission every day. I wanted to leave this place and go somewhere else, but I saw that so many wanted to believe in the Lord and were desperately in need of salvation; therefore, I forgot everything. If the Lord wants me to preach the gospel to the refugees in one place all the time, I am happy to do it. My spirit and heart are at peace all the day. Peace to you. Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang.</p><p>Ji Hwei-jen<br />February 12</p><p>(This letter is sent from the China Inland Mission in Ying-Shang.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>The current condition of the assembly in Hankow: In the past two months there have been meetings almost every day, but we never see God's manifested blessing! After Sister Wang Ju-ching went to K'un-ming and Sister Chen Bi-kun and Sister Wu went to Hong Kong, Hankow has become more lonely. The brothers have almost all gone. We have been preserved by the Lord, but what can we do, aside from learning to preach the gospel and taking care of the mail from the brothers and sisters every day? Since Brothers Kuo and Shang and Sisters Wu and Shang came to Hankow, we have been comforted very much. We still have the opportunity to give hospitality to saints from afar in these few remaining days of grace. Moreover, they have more growth in all areas than we weak and small brothers and sisters. Brother Kuo preached the messages on the last two Lord's Days. Brother Shang and his two sisters were even more zealous in gospel preaching. The day before yesterday was the Lord's Day (February 20). We had the Lord's table meeting at 7:00 p.m., and there were ten brothers and eight sisters. We are really very happy. Most of the brothers and sisters around the table were from far away. None of us expected to meet each other on that day. The price we pay for joy is very great. May we testify more of the Lord's grace day by day.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ju Yao-ju<br />February, in Hankow</p>
