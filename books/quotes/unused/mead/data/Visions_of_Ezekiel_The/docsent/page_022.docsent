   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only does every proper local church need to have a wheel beside it, every proper individual believer must also have a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The living creatures have several ways to move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, they can move by flying because they have the wings of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They can also move by walking on the calf's hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But these two ways of moving are simply to have an ordinary move.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they need extra power to move in a special way, they must move by a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose on your job you are moving daily by the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your co-workers can see that you have something powerful which is strengthening you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are able to bear things that others cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are able to endure things that others cannot because you have the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They also can see that in your character and your behavior, you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In their conscience, they will be convicted and convinced by you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They will see your move in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will see the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in addition to this kind of move with you, there should be also another kind of move, an extraordinary kind of move, the move of a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a period of time, some of your co-workers should be caught by the Lord for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The move of the Lord should be with you at your job.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the move of a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you should work at a job for one year, two years, three years, or even ten years, and nothing happens, that indicates there is no move of the Lord with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are lacking a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you should also have a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is no wheel with you, probably you do not have the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have only the human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither do you have the calf's hoofs; rather, you have the man's crooked feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It may be that on your job you are not such a proper human being; you are somewhat worldly, and the move of the Lord is not with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers and sisters, wherever you go, you must have a high and dreadful wheel by you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you move into a city, eventually there should be a wheel in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you move into a country, there should be a wheel in that country.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The wheel will prove that you are proper, having the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you would have a wheel standing beside you, you must be a proper living creature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must experience the blowing of the Spirit as a stormy wind from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must experience the overshadowing and remaining of the Spirit as the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must experience the burning of the Spirit, and you must gain much electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, you must have the four faces expressing Christ in an adequate way and the eagle's wings by which you can move.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You need to have the calf's hoofs to walk in a very straight, sincere way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The result will be that a high and dreadful wheel is beside you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That wheel is the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consider the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By reading his writings and by reading the book of Acts, we can realize that the Apostle Paul considered himself less than the least.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even his name, Paul, means little.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul was a little man, yet with him were the eagle's wings, the calf's hoofs, and also a high and dreadful wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE WHEELS BEING UPON THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us now consider the wheels in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, it says that the wheels are upon the earth 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Never expect that the move of the Lord will be in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God needs a move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God needs a move in the United States, in New Zealand, in Australia, in Africa, and in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He needs a move upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF BERYL</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, all the wheels look like beryl 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to Daniel 10:6, beryl was the appearance of the Lord when He was moving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This reveals that within the move of the wheels is the appearance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Wherever the wheel goes, it brings the appearance of the Lord to that place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a wheel is with you at school or on your job, it will bring the Lord's appearance there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>People will be able to see the beryl, the appearance of the Lord.</S>
