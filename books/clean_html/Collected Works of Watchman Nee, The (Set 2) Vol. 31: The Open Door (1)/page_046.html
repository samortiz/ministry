<h2 class="head2">Shaohsin, Chekiang Province</h2><p>To my beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I received the large package you sent through Mr. Hsie. May the Lord give you faithfulness and prudence in distributing food among the poor in His household. The warplanes bombed Siao-Shan, and the city is completely burned to the ground. The people of Shaohsin are in terror. They are gradually moving to the mountainous country; the streets of the city are deserted and desolate. Most of the brothers and sisters in the city have moved to the villages in the hills, but Brother Shan Kai-fen is still responsible for the meetings. There are very few people in them though. Many believers have gone to the region of Ping-Shui, but they are scattered in all the villages. No meeting has been raised up yet. My third elder brother, Ji-pu, has also moved to Shi-Chien-Chun in Ping-Shui. (Mailing Address: Mr. Hu in Shi-Chien, c/o Loh-Ching-Mo Lime Store, West Road Intersection, Ping-Shui, Shaohsin.) My family also plans to move to Shi-Chien. We are still in Hua-She because my wife has not agreed yet. The church in Hua-She continues as usual; however, it is hard to make a living, and the environment is frightening. Brother Tang Shou-ling came to give a conference in the region of Nan-Sha, and the churches had great progress. I also went to visit them. There are many who practice living in Christ, rejoicing always, praying without ceasing, and giving thanks in all things. They also are putting their wandering thoughts under control. I received a letter from Brother Hsie Yin-seng of Shanghai saying that he had no news of his company's store in Soochow nor of Brother Kao Guo-jeng. The warehouse in Shanghai was destroyed, and he lost more than one thousand dollars. He has goods in warehouses in Huchow, Soochow, and Hangchow, as well as a house and furniture in Hangchow. If these are also damaged, he may be in debt. I hope you will remember him in prayer. With regard to the gospel work, it depends on the environment. There is a need in the region of Ping-Shui. No one has preached the gospel there because the people in the hill villages have deep-rooted superstitions. We hope the Lord will open a door for us for the gospel, and we hope that you will pray for us. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Lee, Sister Chang, and Brother Tsi-yi.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Hu Ji-tang</p><p>(This letter was mailed from Hua-She, Shaohsin, Chekiang.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><p>To my dearly beloved in the Lord, Sisters X and X:</p><p>An airmail letter from Sister X and another letter from Sister X were recently forwarded to me from Canton. Last night I read Sister X's airmail letter. They have updated me concerning everything. Since my arrival in Kowloon, I have been very busy and do not have much time to write. This is the reason I have not written to you sooner. Thank you for your love and your constant remembrance of me. It really is the Lord's marvelous grace. On the first day of this year, I found myself weeping. May the Lord press me to pieces so that His life may flow out! If the Lord does not give grace, what can I do?</p><p>Thank the Lord for bringing me here so that I might have an opportunity to serve the Lord among the sisters. I did not want to come to Hong Kong, but after praying, I knew that the Lord wanted me here. It is a chance to learn to serve Him. After I saw this, I packed up and came immediately. As I was preparing to come, some bad news arrived. Some people were even moving back to Canton. The boats between Canton and Hong Kong are full of people every day. After I arrived in Kowloon, the Lord showed me that my coming was according to His good will. I am now living with Sister Chang, who is on her way from Foochow to Southeast Asia, and with  Sister Sung An-hwei from Tsinan, who came here to escape the war. We have all received the Lord's grace and are safe. I am really in fear and trembling before God, beseeching Him to preserve me and to give me a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that I would know how to serve the sisters with His love and how to handle everything. The brothers and sisters are all well. Peace to you in the Lord. Please greet Sister Chang Chi-nien and Sister Yuan Chou Jieh-min. That's all for now.</p><p>Sun Zhu Ming-seng<br />January 6<br />[Address omitted]</p>
