   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PERSECUTIONS IN ROME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1848 someone discovered a great building in the city of Rome which was full of human bones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were also two incinerators, beside which were the remains of unburned human bones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One picture of a torture instrument will suffice to show the extent to which the Catholic Church went to deal with Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church would hang a culprit by his two feet upside-down and lay him on an inclined bench.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Very fine ropes would then be tied tightly to the legs and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ropes would then be gradually tightened until they would sink into the flesh and disappear into it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time water would trickle from the ceiling to the man's mouth, which was gagged with a piece of cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This would choke the man and would make it difficult for him to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From 1540 when the Jesuits were formed until 1940, the Inquisition murdered 1.9 million people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the number of people accounted for.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are still countless numbers of unaccounted-for victims.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1901 Pope Leo XIII gave a speech in Rome in which he proclaimed that the church received power from God to confiscate all the properties of the heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Spain, even today, believers are being persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The number of dead cannot be numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The number of living believers amount to only about two thousand five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The condition will worsen towards the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One brother said that great persecutions will arise, and they will come mainly from Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible prophesies that the Roman Catholic Church will be revived one day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TOWARDS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 18:4 says, "And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord wants us to do our best to avoid it, lest we partake of its sin and suffer its sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not only pay attention to this word but must tell new ones about it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every child of God, whether he is a student or a worker, must depart from it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Catholic Church is violent enough in itself in persecuting the Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there is something worse the Jesuits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since 1540 the Jesuits have been writing and propagating Catholicism on the one hand and murdering people on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They murdered many people, yet at the same time they set up schools all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They try to remove true believers in three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first is direct persecution, the second is propagation of theology, and the third is promoting education.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One pope said that no priest would be condemned for lying, cheating, or killing, if these were done in the name of protecting the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to warn all of God's children not to attend the Catholic schools.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our brothers and sisters should not try to associate themselves with them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They should not read their books.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If anyone comes to you to introduce their teachings and acts, you should tell him that you know them all already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must never be cheated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord be merciful to us and spare us of such troubles.</S>
