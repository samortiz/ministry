   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Releasing Christ from</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Imprisonment of the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no doubt that we have Christ in our spirit, but there is much doubt as to whether Christ has any place in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There may be no place, no room, and no ground for Christ in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If this is the case, our spirit is not a residence for Christ but a prison to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is imprisoned by our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time we believed, we exercised our mind to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We turned our mind, which means that our mind was open.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time we also confessed our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Along with our believing there is always our confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way both our mind and our conscience were opened, so we received the Lord Jesus, and He came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After this, however, many believers close their mind and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus came into them, but they enclose Him within their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To say it in another way, they imprison Him by their conscience, mind, emotion, stubborn will, and self.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is in our spirit, but He may be imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason why the apostle Paul, after revealing the vision of the Body in the first part of Ephesians, realized that we need our inner man, our spirit, to be strengthened that Christ may make His home in all the parts of the heart the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that Christ will occupy all the inward parts of our human being and settle down in them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In recent years both here and in the Far East, brothers and sisters have been speaking much about Christ as life and the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, my observation and impression cause me to be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unless the soul is broken and transformed, there is no possibility of having the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason why even up to the end of his ministry Brother Nee still spoke on the breaking of the outer man for the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The outer man, the soulish man, needs to be broken so that the inner man, the spirit, can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People today appreciate Brother Nee s book The Normal Christian Life, but that is only the ABCs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those were the messages he gave more than twenty-five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the early years, the first years after I met him, he always stressed those matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this, however, he was placed into trials for a long time, and following the second World War his messages almost always stressed the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Brother Nee returned to the public ministry after the war, he had a number of times of fellowship with a few brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In those long talks he stressed only one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever I or someone else raised a question, he always answered in one way the outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the problems come from the fact that the outer man, the soul, is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The soul is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mind is too natural, the emotion is too worldly, and the will is too human.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A brother may love the Lord, but his mind may never have been renewed; it is still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, his emotion is earthly, and his will is too human and selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can check ourselves by the way we talk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the brothers and sisters come together to talk, they are very strong, but when we ask them to pray, they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because talking is something in the mind, but praying is something in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the brothers and sisters are talking and someone says, Let us be silent, they will not stop talking even after being asked several times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The best way to quiet people down is to say, Let us have a time of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then everyone will be as quiet as a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because to pray requires us to exercise our spirit, and many saints are not prepared to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if they do pray, they exercise only their mind, and that is what comes out of their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their prayer does not touch their heart or their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many saints simply do not pray at all, not even for several weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They come to the church meetings without a life of prayer, yet they are very active in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we discuss or simply fellowship with one another, eventually we will fight with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have your opinion, I have my idea, and everyone has something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are very strong in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, when we ask people to pray, the weakness in their spirit is immediately exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why we are stressing this matter once again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Similarly, this is why Paul, when he comes to the matter of experience in Ephesians, prays, For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>14, 16-17a .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is indwelling our spirit, but He may not be occupying all the inward parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a very vital matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Colossians 1:27 says, Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no doubt that Christ is in us, but our soul is too strong, natural, earthly, and human.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, eventually, whether intentionally or unintentionally, we imprison Christ by our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the same with all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have Christ, but our Christ has been imprisoned within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church life is Christ realized, expressed, and experienced by all the saints in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This Christ comes out of all the persons and mingles us together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if Christ is imprisoned by the soulish life in you, and He is imprisoned by the soulish life in me, how can we have the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is within us, but He cannot be expressed, and He cannot be realized by us because of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One person s soul is strong, and another person s soul is even stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One person exercises his mind, and another exercises his mind even more.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yes, we are brothers, and we are the members of the Body, but all these members are covered and concealed with a layer of soulish wax.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This soulish wax is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are too strong in our mind, in our emotion, and in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why we need to be strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then Christ will fill us and spread from within to take over our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then the soul will be subdued and broken, and all the parts of the soul will be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then Christ will be expressed, and it is by this Christ that we are one.</S>
