<h1 class="title">THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLES<br />
OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH<br />
AND OF CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE,<br />
AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have seen that to develop ourselves in the truth we need basic principles to rule us and to govern us. Now we must see that there is a further governing principle which is very basic&mdash;Christ and the church. Your developing of any truth must be based upon Christ and the church. This should be and must be your governing principle. Do not pick up aspects from the Bible not related to Christ and the church.</p>
<p>For example, Ephesians 5 tells us that wives should be subject to their own husbands (v. 22) and that husbands should love their wives (v. 25). From my youth I heard the pastors and Christian teachers teach these things. These things, however, should not be separated from Christ and the church (v. 32). The woman&rsquo;s submission and the man&rsquo;s love are taught in the Bible with Christ for the church. Without Christ, who can submit or who can love? Fallen mankind&rsquo;s nature is rebellious and hateful. There is no submission or love within fallen mankind. There is nothing but rebellion and hatred. Without Christ, who can love or who can submit? Therefore, the Bible teaches us women&rsquo;s submission and men&rsquo;s love with Christ. We must be filled in spirit with Christ (Eph. 5:18). Then love comes out and submission comes out. If we develop submission and love without Christ this is wrong. This becomes Confucius&rsquo;s ethics. A biblical submission is not only with Christ, but also for the church.</p>
<p>After over twenty years experience of the church life in the United States, we have seen that whoever loves the church has the best family life. Whoever is for the church has the best marriage life, but the family life and the marriage life of those who have left the church goes downhill. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the rate of separation and divorce is lowest in the local church. You must love Christ and love the church. If you do, as a wife you will submit and as a husband you will love. This again is the way to develop the truth based upon and governed by the principle of Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Holiness, humility, kindness, victory, and spirituality must be developed with Christ for the church. To allegorize any kind of case in the Bible, both in the Old and New Testaments, you must allegorize with Christ and for the church. Then you are safe, and whatever you say is right because the entire Bible was written according to the basic principle&mdash;with Christ for the church. Even the great Babylon on the negative side must be understood in the light of Christ and the church. The safeguarding key of the ministry is &ldquo;with Christ for the church.&rdquo; I have allegorized many portions of the Word and have put out many publications by this key and governing principle. We have even published a book on the Psalms under the view of this governing principle. The title of this book is <em>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms.</em> The principle of &ldquo;with Christ for the church&rdquo; safeguards you, rules you, supports you, and enriches you. An interpretation of the Psalms using this key will be filled with the divine riches.</p>
<p>In our developing in the truth we must first keep the principle of the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people. This is one of the basic principles that governs our interpreting of the Bible. The second basic principle is Christ and the church. In the past, the Brethren told people that to interpret the Bible you must be dispensational. As a young man under the feet of the great teachers among the Brethren assemblies, I was charged definitely and repeatedly not to interpret the New Testament according to the Old Testament since they are in two dispensations. The understanding of dispensations helps to some extent, but this is too shallow. To interpret the Bible according to the principle of the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people is much deeper, higher, and more profound. Another deeper principle is that we must interpret the Bible &ldquo;with Christ for the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the first two chapters of Genesis should be interpreted under this governing principle. In Genesis 1:26 we see Christ as the image of God. God created man in His own image in Genesis, and in the New Testament Colossians 1:15 tells us that God&rsquo;s image is Christ. In Genesis 2:9 we see the tree of life, which also refers to Christ. Adam is also a type of Christ being the Head of all God&rsquo;s creation. God&rsquo;s image outwardly, God&rsquo;s life inwardly, and the Head of all creation is Christ. If we develop these items with Christ we are on the right way. With Adam&rsquo;s wife Eve we see the church (Gen. 2:21-25). The first two chapters of the Bible show us Christ with the church.</p>
<p>We must realize that these first two chapters govern the entire Bible. After these two chapters man fell, and that began another story. This is why we can see that the consummation of the Bible in Revelation 21 and 22 corresponds with the first two chapters of the Bible. These four chapters correspond with each other, and both are with Christ for the church. This is the principle for the beginning of the Bible and for the consummation of the Bible. Also, the entire Bible between these four chapters must also be interpreted with Christ for the church. Even though so many negative things came in, they are related indirectly to Christ and indirectly to the church by providing a black background to help our understanding. Now we can see that we can interpret the entire Bible with Christ for the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 03: The Way to Carry Out the Vision &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
