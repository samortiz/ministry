<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. "John to the Seven Churches<br>Which Are in Asia"<br>(Verse 4)</H2><P>Although the individual epistles were written to seven individual churches, John sent the entire book to each of the seven churches in Asia at the same time. Seven is the number of completion. The seven churches represent all of the churches. Therefore, this epistle is related to us also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. "Grace to You and Peace"<br>(Verse 4)</H2><P>The word of greeting here is the same as that used by Paul (1 Cor. 1:3), but the name of the Triune God here is quite different from that used in other epistles.</P><P>(1) "From Him who is and who was and who is coming." Here the name of God is mentioned. He is the One who is, who was, and who is coming. He never changes. Everything in the world is changing, and the world itself is changing, but God never changes. Therefore, grace and peace will never change either.</P><P>(2) "And from the seven Spirits who are before His throne." "The seven Spirits" does not mean that there are seven Holy Spirits (Eph. 4:4); it only implies that the Holy Spirit has various kinds of work (Rev. 4:5; 5:6).</P><P>(3) "And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth." This speaks of the Lord's work and victory on earth as well as of the glory He will obtain in the future. Such a Triune God is well able to bestow grace and peace upon us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. EXALTATION<br>(REVELATION 1:5b-7)</H2><P>"To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen. Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him. Yes, amen."</P><P>When John came to this point in his writing, he could not help but begin praising. He praised because of "Him who loves us." The love of Christ has two aspects: (1) that which is in the past—He "has released us from our sins by His blood," and (2) that which is experienced now and will be completely fulfilled in the future—"and made us a kingdom [or, kings], priests to His God and Father." When we consider this, we truly have to say with John, "To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen."</P><P>When John recalled the love he had received, he could not help but begin to praise. Yet at the same time, when he thought of the condition of the worldly people at the time of Christ's second coming, he uttered a word of warning in verse 7. "Behold" means that we need to pay attention. "He comes with the clouds." Just as the Lord ascended to the heavens in the clouds, so also shall He come again with the clouds. This exactly matches what is spoken in Acts 1:9-11. "And every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him. Yes, amen" (Rev. 1:7). This word matches that of Matthew 24:30.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE TESTIMONY OF GOD<br>(REVELATION 1:8)</H2><P>"I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty." </P><P>Here God testifies concerning Himself as: (1) the One who never changes and (2) the almighty One. The purpose of this testimony is to cause us to depend entirely on Him in the midst of tribulations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. JOHN'S DESCRIPTION OF HIS OWN CONDITION<br>(REVELATION 1:9-10a)</H2><P>"I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in spirit on the Lord's Day." </P>
