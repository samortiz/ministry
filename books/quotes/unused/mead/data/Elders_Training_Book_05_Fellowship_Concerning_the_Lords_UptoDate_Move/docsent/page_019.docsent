   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX HOW THE BELIEVERS SHOULD MEET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Strictly speaking, six verses in the New Testament say something about how the believers should meet Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23 and 26; Hebrews 10:25; and Matthew 18:20.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 20:6-12 there is an account of a meeting in Troas in which the Apostle Paul gave a message, but this passage of Scripture cannot give us a hint concerning how the church should meet locally since the local church meeting is different from a meeting for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 10:25 says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse gives us a little window to show us how the saints met in the early days of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They met to exhort one another, and they were to exhort one another even more as they saw the day drawing near.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the saints meetings they did not have a big speaker, but they assembled themselves together to mutually exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hebrews 10:25 shows us the mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of the six verses we have referred to show that in the early days the believers always met in the way of mutuality in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you compare such a view with the practice among all the Christians through the centuries, you can see that their practice is really off from what the Bible reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They deviated from the proper way to meet because they took the natural way and the easy short-cut way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>RELATIONSHIPS IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew 18:20, strictly speaking, is the only verse in the Gospels which tells us something about the believers meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse says, For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, in My name should read into My name since the Greek word here is eis meaning into.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our translation we should have the boldness to take care of the spiritual significance of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also, the word for in this verse indicates that it is a continuation of the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The heading for Matthew 18 in the outline of the Recovery Version is Relationships in the Kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the kingdom there are the relationships between the kingdom people, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The entire thirty-five verses of Matthew 18 deals with our relationships with one another in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matthew 18 unveils four major points concerning this topic: 1 to be humble vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1-5 ; 2 not stumbling anyone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>6-10 ; 3 recovering the backsliding saints vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>12-20 ; 4 forgiving up to seventy times seven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>21-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for a proper relationship to be maintained between the believers, these four items are absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers should exercise to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the proud ones would be a stumbling block to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One who is humble would not stumble others, would take care of the sinning ones, the backsliding saints, and would always forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verses 15 through 17 say, Now if your brother sins, go, reprove him between you and him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he hears you, you have gained your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as the Gentile and the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must try to recover the sinning brother with frankness, with reproof.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he does not hear you, you should take with you one or two more that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that these two or three are not the church, but they are part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They need to tell this matter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the sinning brother refuses to hear the church, the Word tells us to let him be to us as a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean to exclude him, to excommunicate him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word says to let him be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let him be what he is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the 1984 elders training I pointed out that I was strongly against the practice of excluding brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To drive a backsliding brother out of the church is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a brother does not listen to the church, let him be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This matter is up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church like the Gentile, the heathen, and the tax collector, the sinners who are outside the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 18 says, Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse indicates that on the one hand you let the brother be what he is, but on the other hand you have to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not exercise the visible authority, but the spiritual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verses 19 and 20 continue, Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When verse 19 says if two of you agree on earth concerning anything, this, no doubt, concerns the dealing with such a sinning brother who is not willing to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the context, the two or three are gathered together into the Lord s name for the purpose of praying for the sinning one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When these two or three are gathered together in such a way, the Lord is there in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then Peter proceeded to ask the Lord how often he should forgive his brother when his brother sins against him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter thought that perhaps seven times was the maximum amount.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus said to him, however, I do not say to you until seven times, but until seventy times seven v. 22 . After this, the Lord gave a long illustration showing how we have to forgive our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is in such a context that the matter of the believers meeting came out of the Lord s mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Matthew 16 the Lord spoke about the church and in Matthew 18 He speaks about the church again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church referred to by the Lord in Matthew 16 refers to the universal aspect of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord told Peter that He would build His church upon this rock, which means that the universal church, the unique church, would be built upon the proper revelation of Christ which Peter had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What Peter had seen as a direct revelation from the Father was the rock, the foundation, upon which the Lord would build His church, His universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To build up the universal church there is the need of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matthew 18 affords us a small window to see something concerning the building up of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this context the Lord picks up something concerning the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have some problem, we can go and tell the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is surely the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To build up the local church, there is the need of the proper relationship toward the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The proper relationship involves humility, no stumbling blocks, and a situation which is full of the recovery of the sinning ones and full of forgiveness to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is only by these four factors that a good relationship can be maintained between the believers for the building up of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I doubt whether there is a church today on this earth which is full of these four items humility, no stumbling blocks, full of recovery of the sinning ones, and full of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even all the leading ones in the churches need to check with themselves as to whether they do not have any pride or still hold on to something that is a stumbling block to others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do you love all the sinning ones and try your best to recover them?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Have you forgiven all those who have offended you from your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Charles Spurgeon, who was a master at using illustrations to prove a point, once said that when many Christians forgive others it is like a person burying a dead dog and leaving the tail of the dog standing up out of the earth, visible for all to see.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You may be offended by a certain brother and forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then you would go to two other brothers and say, That brother offended me to the uttermost but I forgave him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this kind of forgiveness the dog tail can still be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many of us hold the dog tail secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For an elder not to be offended is the greatest miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To be an elder means that you become a target of others criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many of the brothers love the elders, but at the same time some have a bow and arrow pointed at the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Also, all the elders must admit that humanly speaking they all love to see everybody respect them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we expect others to respect us, we are ready to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once an elder gets offended, it is hard for him to forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Not to forget the offense is to hold the tail of the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>From my youth I have been studying the truth concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Quite often I ask myself, Could I really be there in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After reading Matthew 18 once more, I asked myself, Have you forgiven all the ones who have offended you?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you do not forgive your brother, according to the Lord you shall by no means be forgiven in the millennium until you have paid the last quadrans Matt 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In other words, you will not be forgiven until you forgive your offending brother from your heart Matt 18:35; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Luke 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I doubt whether we really forgive every offender from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Generally speaking, you forgive, but you may still be holding on to the dog tail.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>All of us need to keep a good relationship with our fellow-believers.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In order to do this, you have to humble yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Do not think that you are somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Rather, you are nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We all need to humble ourselves by becoming as little children Matt 18:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then we have to clear up all the blocks that stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After this, we have to take care of and recover the sinning brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then we have to forgive them even to seventy times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In order to maintain this kind of relationship in the kingdom, there is the need of a gathering according to Matthew 18:20, which gives us another small window to see how we believers should meet.</S>
