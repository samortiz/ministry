We need to see the fulfillment in the New Testament of the typology in the Old Testament concerning God's economy
On the other hand, if we want to know the New Testament, we have to spend the time to look at all these pictures
Saint Augustine said that the New Testament is concealed in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New Testament
Ephesians is a top book and Romans is a basic book in the New Testament, but they do not sing verses from these books
If you look at a picture without the proper definition, you may consider a lion as a tiger or a turtle as a mouse
Although the Brethren saw this, they did not see that the history of the kings in the Old Testament was a typology of God's economy
God's economy is God's plan, God's divine arrangement, for the fulfillment of His good pleasure in His will to be His purpose
Israel's history was not only a type of the entire church, as the Brethren teachers pointed out, but also a type of God's economy
The speaking of the ministry with the utterances and expressions is always improving, not by myself but by the Lord's further revelation
We need to be a person crucified to live by another Person, another life, which is the embodiment of the Triune God mingled with us
All the overcomers of the New Testament are kings who have received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life
The whole Bible unveils God's economy, which is for the accomplishment of His heart's desire for His good pleasure
Before the new testament age, that is, before the Lord's incarnation, God had chosen a people on this earth called Israel
These two peoples are a description of one thing which God has done, and this one thing is the accomplishment of God's economy
After the descendants of Abraham became a people, they eventually became fallen into the hand of Egypt and its king, Pharaoh
God's chosen people fell into the hand of Satan and Satan's world, so there was the need of God's salvation to save them
God, the just God, the righteous God, formed something judicial to redeem His people by fulfilling His righteous requirements
After God's redemption and in God's salvation, God ordained that His people should have no sin, no leaven, a feast without leaven
She was a type of the church becoming degraded and fallen absolutely into Satan's hand and even mingled with Satan as one
In Revelation 17 the Lord called the degraded church the great whore, the Great Babylon, the mother of harlots
These kings are types of the New Testament believers, because all of the New Testament believers were saved by God to be kings
At the beginning of Israel's history with the priests, there was no king, but they did have the Urim and the Thummim
The kings of the Old Testament were a type, and this type is fulfilled by the New Testament believers being kings
Romans 5:17 says that 'those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life'
Do not forget that when you open your mouth to speak Christ into people, you become God's oracle and God's prophet
At the beginning of the New Testament, when Christ was to be conceived and born, the Holy Spirit is mentioned for the first time
While the Lord Jesus was walking on the earth and ministering for God, Matthew 12:28 tells us that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God
Although the Spirit was with the Lord Jesus in His living and working on the earth, John 7:39 says that 'the Spirit was not yet'
Why near the end of the Lords ministry on this earth did John tell us that the Spirit whom the believers were about to receive was not yet
Before us, Andrew Murray saw that the Holy Spirit of God is something particular, yet the Spirit is something more
Even with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God had not been consummated wholly; that is, He had not been completed in full
When He entered into resurrection, He was wholly glorified by releasing God with God's nature and God's life from within Him
When He was crucified, He brought this man, that is, His humanity, to the cross and died there to terminate humanity
Now, the life-giving Spirit is for God's new creation , for God's producing of many sons , who are the believers
These two spiritsthe divine lifegiving Spirit and our spirit which has been regenerated by the lifegiving Spiritare mingled together as one
In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul said, 'But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit,' indicating that we are one spirit with the Lord
In verse 6 he said that the mind set on the mingled spirit is life and peace, but the mind set on the flesh is death
Apart from the mingled spirit, there is no regeneration, no sanctification, no renewing, no transformation, and no conformation
There are many books written to tell Christians how to do things, such as how to be holy and how to be victorious
The Spirit of God is uniquely one, but to meet the need of the degraded church, this Spirit has been intensified sevenfold
These two will become a couple-the Triune God consummated to be the Husband, and the tripartite man transformed to be the bride
These four constituted together are the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem
The cross brings in resurrection which is not merely a thing but a living person who is the consummated Triune God as the lifegiving Spirit
Now you should be clear that to be a believer in Christ is simply to have your being in and according to the mingled spirit
In your family life, in your daily life, in your church life, and in your social life, you should live by this mingled spirit
Crucifixion always leads you to live in resurrection, and this resurrection is just the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit
The Lord has shown us His economy, and He has shown us the contents of His economy, especially throughout the past thirty-two years
Romans 10:12 says, 'For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him'
The next verse, verse 18, tells us that we have to pray this word, and we have to be watchful concerning this kind of prayer
Timothy 222 says But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness faith love peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
Our practice of living the life of a God-man is a constitution of Christ as righteousness, faith, love, and peace
All these things have been gradually unveiled to us by the Lord in the past years, and they have even been printed in books
Most of the saints who do practice prophesying do not realize what it means to prophesy in the church meetings
Can you say that you do not have the gift to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people?
Your kind of taking the lead among the saints is not according to the spirit, but according to your kind of realization
One famous revival took place in Wales from 1904 to 1906 under the leadership of Evan Roberts, who was a coal miner
In a short time, this revival became so prevailing that when people would go to Wales to preach the gospel, no one would be saved
Where is the model of living Christ and magnifying Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ?
We are not that rich in the Lord's recovery because we do not have the genuine, living practice of calling on the Lord
In all the churches there should be groups of ten or fifteen saints who come together often to call on the Lord
When you open your mouth with the exercise of your spirit to call on the Lord, right away you are under His shining
You make a thorough confession of your sins, failures, mistakes, defects, trespasses, transgressions, and wrongdoings
The urgent need today is the practice of a kind of living that belongs to God-men, and the God-men are the very components of God's economy
Out of these revivals the private churches, such as the Baptist church, the Presbyterian church, and the Methodist church, were produced
Watchman Nee considered the Brethren revival as a fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3, and D
Panton, a student of Robert Govett, said that the influence of the Brethren revival was greater than that of Luther's reformation
At the beginning of the twentieth century the Welsh revival took place, which was quite prevailing but only for a short time
As Brother Nee said, to the Lord's move China was a virgin land not touched fully by the deformed Christianity
At his time a number of groups of believers were suffering persecution by the Catholic Church and the state churches in northern Europe
Many of these persecuted believers fled to Zinzendorf's estate in Saxony in southern Germany, and Zinzendorf received them
They signed an agreement to keep the oneness among them and to lay aside their differences in doctrine and in their religious backgrounds
On that day, history tells us, while partaking of the Lord's table, they experienced the outpouring of the Spirit
Brother Nee stressed two things: Christ as life to produce the church and the church as the Body of Christ to express Christ
They stressed matters such as leaving the denominations, baptism by immersion, head covering, and the way to practice the Lord's table
According to my knowledge, the first divine revelation discovered by the church fathers was the revelation of the Triune God
In the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament held by the Jews, it is difficult to find out anything concerning the Triune God
Although 2 Samuel 7:14 does say that God has a son, referring to Christ, the Jewish rabbis do not understand this word
After the New Testament was written, the first group of Bible students after the apostles were the church fathers
The Lord spoke the word in Matthew 28:19 after His resurrection, while He stayed with His disciples for forty days prior to His ascension
Before the Lord's resurrection, not only was the Spirit not yet, but even the firstborn Son of God was not yet
They had Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 and no doubt had read these verses again and again, but none of the Jews understood them
When the church fathers read all these things in the Scriptures, they considered them and eventually invented a word in Latin: triune
Before us, no one ever discovered God's economy with Christ as its centrality and universality and all its reality
It was not until the last ten years that we put all these things together to have a full picture of God's economy
Now we are living Him so we should remain in His crucifixion to be conformed to the mold of His death every moment in every part of our life
A God-man is a man who is regenerated and transformed to be one with God, taking God as his life, his person, and his everything
We all need to live such a life-the older ones and the young ones, the brothers and the sisters, the elders and the common saints
Our living the life of a Godman will save people edify others and build up the local churches even to the building up of the Body of Christ
May the Lord bless us with Himself as the life-giving Spirit that we may touch Him in the mingled spirit by these life practices
