   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Gifts Needing to Endeavor</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Develop Their Spiritual Capacity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So That the Church Can Increase and Spread</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who function as a prophet or teacher should endeavor to develop their spiritual capacity so that the church can increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether one is in a local church, in a district, or in a small group, those with the function of a prophet or teacher should endeavor to develop this gift to expand their spiritual capacity so that the church can increase and spread the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Elders Needing to Endeavor to Coordinate</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>with the Gifts for the Propagation</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>in Their Administration</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of General Affairs</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders need to endeavor to coordinate with the gifts for the propagation in their administration of the general affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the small groups provide an environment for everyone to exercise his or her talents, the gifts of many saints will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the development of these gifts, many people will be saved and there will be much propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within a very short time a small group will double and become two small groups, and the number of people will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the number of people increases to the point that a meeting hall should be built, the elders need to address this matter related to the administration of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the responsibility of the elders to take care of matters such as purchasing land, planning, and drawing up the budget.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elders also need to have insight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once they notice that the gifts in a certain district are developing in a very positive manner and that many people are being saved, they need to quickly purchase land to build a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the administrative side, the elders need to endeavor to coordinate in general affairs as the gifts develop.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Elders Needing to Strictly Oversee</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Move of the Local Churches,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>but Not Intentionally or Unintentionally Restricting the Proper Move</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and Propagation of the Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Elders also need to strictly oversee the move of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders should not think that they can take an extended time of rest, like animals going into hibernation, since there are small groups and since in each small group spiritual gifts are being developed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The elders certainly have suffered very much in the past, even to the point of being worn out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now that the burden can be shared among four hundred small groups, it seems as if the elders can live in ease and comfort because things have become much simpler.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders must not think in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They must realize that the responsibility of the elders will only increase as the small groups multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the small groups multiply and develop, the saints will increasingly speak of the need for additional meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders cannot be negligent in this matter; they should be like a Combined Logistics Team that supplies the needs of the military.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a war, the military forces should be provided with supplies when they call headquarters for help.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they are not provided with supplies, the Combined Logistics Team is being negligent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Combined Logistics Team cannot replace the military forces in fighting the battle, nor should they restrict the advancement of the military forces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, the Combined Logistics Team needs to be aware of the situation and be swift to respond to the needs of the advancing military forces.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It should consider the interests of the military forces and prepare the needed supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were not so clear concerning this matter in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consequently, the authority of the elders might have restricted the development of the gifts, but some of these gifts also did not stay within the bounds of their measure and encroached upon the duties of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the elders exercise their responsibility for oversight, they should be careful not to restrict the development of the gifts or hinder them from propagating.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders function is not to propagate but to be a Combined Logistics Team ready to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Ephesians 4, there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These ones should endeavor to exercise and develop their capacity, to propagate, to edify others, to lead others, to revive others, and to establish others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then spontaneously the kingdom of God will spread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This relates to spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, in relation to general affairs, there is the need for local administration in order to respond to various practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not the responsibility of the gifts but of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the elders notice that a certain small group is not on the track of God s New Testament economy, they should both oversee and intervene.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders should strictly oversee the move of the local churches so that they progress in a proper way according to God s New Testament economy and are not led astray by different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, they should be careful to not restrict or kill the proper move and propagation of the gifts either intentionally or unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should each remain in our proper place; the gifted ones should go out to propagate, and those in the eldership should actively coordinate with them in general affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There presently is a need for a meeting hall for the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The small groups are being promoted, and I believe that the capacity of our meeting halls will not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the elders must keep their eyes wide open, their view must be broadened, and they must quickly purchase land and build a bigger meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This requires long-term plans.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, they can fellowship with the gifted ones to discuss future plans and a budget.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once these have been completed, they can report to the saints so that everyone can begin to make regular offerings to meet the demands that will develop from the positive results of our future propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not raise money at the last minute but begin making preparations in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a matter for the elders to address.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The elders need to constantly watch the development and propagation of the gifts so that they can be prepared to coordinate in a timely manner.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should be clear concerning gifts and offices: In terms of gifts there are first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In terms of offices there are first apostles, then helps deacons , and then administrations elders .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In a meeting there are only prophets and teachers who release revelation as well as teach to edify and establish those who attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the meetings those who have the function and office of apostles, elders, and deacons are only brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who are gifts should endeavor to develop their spiritual capacity so that there can be a continual propagation and so that those who have been gained can be established.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This will bring in the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who have responsibility for administration should broaden their view and actively prepare to coordinate in general affairs related to the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, no one will overstep, and no one will restrict others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the past, due to the lack of a clear understanding, there was an overstepping in some areas that caused both sides to be restricted in their function.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that in the future the gifts will be developed even more, and the offices will be strengthened even more so that the church may gain increase in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This fellowship is like our house rules.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When there are house rules, the father, mother, and siblings in the family know what is expected of them and thus are able to fulfill their family duties.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we carry out our responsibilities in an orderly way, the church will spread step by step, and the Lord will have a way to go forward.</S>
