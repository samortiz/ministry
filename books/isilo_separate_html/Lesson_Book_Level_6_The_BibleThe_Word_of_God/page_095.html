<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The apostle Paul wrote this book (1:1) about A.D. 60, prior to the writing of the book of Romans (see Acts 20:1 footnote 1 and 20:3 footnote 1). It was written in Macedonia (2:13 and footnote 2; 7:5-6; 8:1; 9:2,4) &ldquo;to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia&rdquo; (1:1).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the New Testament ministry and ministers.</p>
<p>C. The background: [Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians as a loving father. In his first Epistle Paul disciplined the Corinthians. Parents know that in disciplining children we run the risk of alienating them. If a parent disciplines a child without limitation, the child may want to run away from home. After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul was concerned about how the believers at Corinth would react to his discipline. Paul was not at rest about the matter, and he even regretted somewhat writing that Epistle. He was concerned that the entire church in Corinth would be alienated from him. Because of his deep concern, he was eagerly awaiting Titus to bring him news of the response of the Corinthians to his first Epistle. In chapter two Paul did not have rest in his spirit, for he did not find Titus. But we see from chapter seven that Titus came with good news.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s first Epistle had caused sorrow to the Corinthians, but this sorrow produced repentance unto salvation. That salvation was a full reconciliation. When Paul heard this good news, he was beside himself with joy. As he says in 7:13, &ldquo;We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus.&rdquo; When he wrote his second Epistle, Paul was in such an atmosphere of encouragement and joy. Thus, as we read chapter seven, we can touch the feeling in Paul&rsquo;s spirit, a feeling of deep concern for the church in Corinth.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [First Corinthians reveals the matter of living Christ for the church. If we read this Epistle in a thoughtful way, we may wonder if there is a pattern of living Christ for the church. We may say as we read this book, &ldquo;Paul, show us a pattern. We have seen many things in our parents, relatives, neighbors, friends, and colleagues, but we have never seen a person living Christ for the church. We would like to see a pattern, for a pattern is much better than thousands of words.&rdquo; Realizing the need for such a pattern, Paul presents this pattern in 2 Corinthians.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [The first Epistle to the Corinthians was the apostle&rsquo;s argument, an argument which defeated and subdued the distracted and confused Corinthians. Now the second Epistle brings them back into the experience of Christ, who was the subject of his argument in the first Epistle. Hence, the second Epistle is more experiential, more subjective, and deeper than the first. In the first, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, the church, and the gifts are covered as the major subjects. In the second, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are further developed, but the gifts are not even mentioned. They are replaced in this book by the ministry, which is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross. The second Epistle gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ. These constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant. The first Epistle deals negatively with the gifts; the second speaks positively about the ministry. The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts. The ministry is to minister Christ whom we have experienced; the gifts are just to teach the doctrines concerning Christ. Not the gifts, but the ministry produced and formed by the experience of the sufferings, the afflictions, of Christ, is the proof that the apostles are ministers of Christ.]</p>

The sections: 1) introduction (1:1&mdash;2:11), 2) the ministry of the new covenant (2:12&mdash;3:11), 3) the ministers of the new covenant (3:12&mdash;7:16), 4) the apostle&rsquo;s fellowship concerning the ministry to the needy saints (8:1&mdash;9:15), 5) Paul&rsquo;s vindication of his apostolic authority (10:1&mdash;13:10), and 6) conclusion (13:11-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. GALATIANS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to the churches of Galatia (1:1-2) around A.D. 54, during his third journey of ministry. At this time he had passed through Galatia (Acts 16:6) and arrived in Corinth (Acts 18:1) for the first time. He stayed there for one year and six months (Acts 18:11).</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ replacing the law and versus religion and traditions.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The churches in Galatia had been bewitched by the Judaizers (3:1). They had been distracted from Christ to Judaism. A good number of the New Testament believers in the churches of Galatia had turned back to the old Jewish religion and were endeavoring to keep the law with the ordinance of circumcision. This was the background that gave Paul the opportunity to write this wonderful book.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The book of Galatians is focused on Christ replacing the law. It is not God&rsquo;s intention to keep His people under the law. His intention is to dispense Christ into them. Thus, Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s economy must replace the law. Because the Judaizers were misusing the law, the Epistle to the Galatians was written to reveal Christ as the replacement of the law. Yes, the law was given for a specific purpose, but God did not intend for the law to be permanent. Christ has come to replace the law with Himself. This is the focal point of Galatians.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [In chapter one Paul shows that God is pleased to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, in us (1:15-16). In chapter two we see that we should live this Christ, not the law (2:19-21).] [In chapter three, the Spirit is mainly for us to have the divine life. In chapter four, the Spirit is for us to be born of God. In chapter five, the Spirit is for us to live and walk.] In [chapter six, the Spirit is for our aim, our goal. In the first two chapters of Galatians we have the revelation of Christ as the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy, but in the last four chapters we have the Spirit in our experience.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;the will of God to rescue us out of the evil religious age (1:1-5), 2) the revelation of the apostle&rsquo;s gospel (1:6&mdash;4:31), 3) the walk of God&rsquo;s children (5:1&mdash;6:17), and 4) conclusion&mdash;the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be with our spirit (6:18).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_094.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_096.html">Next</a> </body></html>
