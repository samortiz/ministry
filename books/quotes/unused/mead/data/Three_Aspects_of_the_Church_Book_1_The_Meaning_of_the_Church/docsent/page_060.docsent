   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 10 THE TEMPLE 2 The Way to Build The Design</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Moses built the tabernacle, he built it according to the pattern that was shown to him in the mountain by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This pattern was not according to man s opinion or imagination but was according to God s revelation Exo 25:40; 39:42-43; Heb 8:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building of the temple was carried out according to the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Chronicles 28:11-19 indicates that the Spirit of God inspired David with the design for the construction of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although God desired that man build the temple, the design of the temple was from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did not give man any ground to make decisions in regard to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God revealed to Moses the blueprint for building the tabernacle, and He revealed to David the blueprint for building the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though Solomon was the one who built the temple, he did not receive revelation directly from God; rather, he received it indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection, and David typifies Christ in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The blueprint for the building of the church was not revealed at the time of Christ s resurrection; rather, God revealed the blueprint for building the church while Christ was passing through suffering on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The design for building the temple was revealed to David, not to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not wait until the time of Solomon to reveal the design for building the temple; rather, He revealed it while the tabernacle was wandering on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, God did not wait until after the resurrection of Christ to reveal the principles for building the church; rather, He revealed them while Christ was passing through suffering on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From Christ s speaking in Matthew 16, we can clearly see what the church should be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout two thousand years of church history, the Roman Catholic Church has been involved in great controversies with regard to Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even before the papacy was introduced into Catholicism, there were sharp contentions concerning the design of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even today, there are different understandings in Roman Catholicism and Protestantism concerning the matter of the building of the church as revealed in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each side builds according to its own understanding of Matthew 16, which occupies an extremely important position in defining what the church should be like on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our intention in this chapter is not to expound Matthew 16; rather, by using the Lord s words, our desire is to declare to the saints that the Lord Jesus revealed the proper blueprint of the church to His disciples before His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not wait until after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This matches the type of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The design for the building of the temple was revealed to David, not to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though the design for building the temple was revealed to David, the execution of that design was carried out through the hands of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>David was given the design for the temple, and Solomon carried out the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that Christ revealed the blueprint of the church while He was on the earth, and now Christ is executing the blueprint of the church in resurrection in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew 16 contains the revelation, and Acts 2 reveals the execution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The revealing One is Christ, as typified by David, and the executing One is Christ, as typified by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must pay attention to how the church should be built.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The building of the church was revealed by Christ on earth and is being carried out by Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we live in resurrection and allow the resurrected Christ to have the ground in us, the blueprint revealed in Matthew 16 can be fulfilled, and when we live in resurrection, the blueprint of the church can be carried out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The controversy between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church is doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Having received mercy from God, we need to realize that the building of the church is not merely a matter of doctrine but also of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we continue to live in ourselves and continue to be natural, the design of the temple will remain a doctrine to us and not be our practical reality, even though we may have a proper understanding of Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, if we live in resurrection, allowing God to deal with us, learning to reject ourselves, knowing the resurrected Christ, and allowing the Spirit of Christ to have ground in us, then our spiritual condition will match Matthew 16, even if our comprehension of Matthew 16 is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Throughout the centuries, the endless controversy between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church concerning Matthew 16 has been with respect to the position of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dealing with this issue on a doctrinal level is an endless matter with no hope of a resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If men had been willing to judge their flesh and themselves, the pope and archbishops would not have come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We acknowledge that there is authority in the church and an order in God s house, but no one can be the authority in the church in his natural man, in himself, and in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is not a worldly organization and cannot make decisions concerning responsibility and authority in the church based merely on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we base our decisions merely on doctrine, the church will have many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The blueprint of the church is not in doctrine but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must see that Matthew 16 is the revelation and that Acts 2 is the execution.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The group of people who prayed in the upper room in Jerusalem was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They left everything behind; they forsook everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were able to pray in one accord because they rejected themselves, put themselves aside, and allowed Christ through the Holy Spirit to have a prominent position in them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may have forgotten about Matthew 16, but they expressed the condition described in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the evening of the day of Christ s resurrection, His Spirit entered into them, enabling them to pray in one accord for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They lived in the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, on the day of Pentecost, God was able to produce the church through them and thus fulfill the word spoken in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even though the Protestant Church has a doctrinal understanding of Matthew 16 that is more proper than the Roman Catholic Church, both replace Christ with man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to understand that the blueprint of the church can be executed and fulfilled only in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although we may know the principles of authority, we should not rely on doctrines and human arrangements; rather, we should live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every one of us should check, when we bear some authority, Am I acting in myself or in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Am I acting according to my disposition or according to the Spirit of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not live in the resurrected Christ and allow Christ to have the ground within us, the blueprint of the church will be altered among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the local churches we have elders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the light of the truth, they are the authority in the church, and the brothers and sisters should submit to them Acts 15:2; 1 Thes 5:12-13; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if the elders act like high government officials when the brothers and sisters visit them, it will give people an uneasy and uncomfortable feeling in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The elders may be right doctrinally, but their being is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They may be right according to revelation but not according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This can be likened to having the design of the temple, which was revealed to David, but the building of the temple carried out by someone other than Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The doctrine is in Matthew 16, but the reality is in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes the brothers and sisters submit themselves to the elders as if they were students submitting to a school principal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This makes people feel uneasy and uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the principal is not in sight, the students run around like mice, but when the principal comes, they freeze and dare not move, just as mice do when they see a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a strange phenomenon in the church, and it carries a flavor that is totally worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In terms of doctrine it cannot be considered wrong, but in terms of life it is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every one of us should learn to reject ourselves and to live in the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the presence of the older brothers, we should live before God, and when they are absent, we should live before God in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should submit to the elders because of life, not because of regulation; we should submit to them in the Spirit of resurrection, not based on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As brothers and sisters in the church, we should submit to the elders, who are the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not submit, we are unlawful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if we simply act according to doctrine without living in the Spirit of resurrection, there is not much profit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The revelation seen by David was executed by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that the revelation of the church unveiled in the Scriptures can be carried out only by the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If there is no Spirit of resurrection in the church, the church will certainly become deformed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The blueprint of the church altogether depends upon the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The church is where the Spirit of resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Simply put, the blueprint of the church is the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we live in the Spirit of resurrection, the reality of Solomon s building of the temple is fulfilled within us; that is, the reality of David s design for the building of the temple is executed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All of the problems in the church are due to the fact that we have David s design without Solomon s execution.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have revelation and doctrine but not much expression of the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In some local churches the saints may argue among themselves, and their arguments may be scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One group of brothers may say that they do certain things according to the principle of Antioch, and another group of brothers may say that they do certain things according to the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The principle of Jerusalem is correct and so is the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>These two principles can be compared to the design that was revealed to David.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The problem is not related to the design but to who carries out the design.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Is this design carried out by man or by the Holy Spirit, by the flesh or by Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should not merely hold on to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must allow the Lord as the Spirit of resurrection within us to break us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We cannot take a doctrine merely as written instructions, nor can we merely take the basis of the Scripture as a safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If our person and our life are not right, the doctrine concerning the line of Jerusalem will not be realized among us, even though the doctrine itself is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This means that the design cannot be carried out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>From the types revealed in the Bible, we can see that the design revealed to David must be executed by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All the revelations in the Bible can be fulfilled only in the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we live in the Spirit of resurrection, we will not have contentions in serving the Lord and in the church; instead, we will have the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In general, for the last twenty years there has not been much contention among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The underlying reason is that the brothers have received mercy to touch the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is not a matter of doctrine but of person.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We may contend for a correct doctrine, but if our person is wrong, we are still wrong even though our doctrine is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we were enlightened, we would see that it is not our doctrine that is wrong but our person.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We would see that we still speak in ourselves and act in our flesh and that we have not been broken and do not act in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We allow ourselves to have the ground instead of giving the ground to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In everything we do, we are the ones who are acting, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>These words should become a lamp shining within us, causing our outward contentions for doctrine to completely collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we have been broken, we will not be able to argue, even if we want to, and consequently, we will be able to see the execution of the blueprint for the church, in the expression of the true church.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we are willing to submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, as soon as we begin to argue, we will realize our self and our flesh and be willing to submit, saying, O Lord, I am about to argue, but my person is not right, so I will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This may seem unpleasant, but at this point the blueprint of the church will be shown in us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is Solomon s execution of what was revealed to David, and this is what the Lord was referring to when He said, Upon this rock I will build My church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Through these experiences, Matthew 16 will be expressed in us to a great extent.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>However, if we insist on our own view regarding doctrines and take the Bible only as a basis for argument and debate, we will build upon ourselves and our contentions, not upon Christ, even if our doctrines are correct.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This will make us comparable to the Peter of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The real blueprint for building the church is fulfilled in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The blueprint for the temple was revealed to David and executed by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In the matter of building the church, no one can bring in his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Solomon built the temple according to David s design, which came from the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>There was no room for human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Those who serve in the church and have a part in building up the church must learn to put their opinions aside, to receive revelation in spirit, and to see the blueprint for the building from God.</S>
