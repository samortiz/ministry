<h2 class="head2">N. Considering It</h2><p>In addition to musing upon the Word of God, the psalmist also considered it (119:95). In our spiritual experience we also consider the Word of God. Throughout the day we may consider what we enjoyed in our musing upon the Word in the morning. By recalling our enjoyment of the Lord in the Word, we receive further nourishment from the Word.</p><h2 class="head2">O. Esteeming It<br />Right concerning All Things</h2><p>The psalmist also esteemed God&rsquo;s Word right concerning all things (v. 128). The word &ldquo;right&rdquo; here does not mean right as opposed to wrong. It means upright, straight, strict in all things. When we muse upon the Word and consider it, we shall regard it upright in all things.</p><h2 class="head2">P. Entering into It</h2><p>Verse 130 says, &ldquo;The entrance of thy words giveth light.&rdquo; When we enter into God&rsquo;s Word, we see light. The Hebrew word for entrance means an opening, a gate, and it implies entering in. God&rsquo;s Word has an entrance through which we may get into it. Let us learn to enter into the Word of God. Light is not outside the Word; it is in the Word. When we enter into the Word of God, we shall be in the light that shines there.</p><h2 class="head2">Q. Learning It</h2><p>After we enter into the Word, we learn the Word. Verse 73 indicates that God has created us in such a way that we may have understanding of His Word and learn His commandments. Verse 71 says, &ldquo;It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.&rdquo; This verse indicates that God raises up circumstances to discipline us so that we may learn the Word. Through suffering and affliction we learn His law. Inwardly we have faculties created by God by which we can understand His Word, and outwardly we have the environment and the circumstances by which we are disciplined. God allows us to be afflicted so that we may learn the Word of God.</p><h2 class="head2">R. Treasuring It</h2><p>The psalmist also treasured the Word of God. He treasured it as great spoil (v. 162), as all riches (v. 14), above thousands of gold and silver (vv. 72, 127), and as a heritage forever (v. 111). Spoil refers to valuables taken away from an enemy. If we muse upon the Word, the enemy will be defeated, and we shall gather much spoil. Then we shall become rich and possess gold and silver, which will become our heritage. In ancient times, when a king conquered his enemies, he seized the gold and silver. Likewise, when we enjoy the Word and defeat the enemy through the Word, we shall gain spoil from the conquered enemy. Then we shall have the riches, the gold and silver, and the heritage.</p><p>Some may complain that what I have said about treasuring the Word of God is too experiential. If we do not understand the matter in this way, how should we treasure the Word as our spoil? We need to muse upon the Word and experience victory over the enemy through the Word. Then we shall have the spoil, the spoil will be our riches, the riches will be our gold and silver, and this will become our inheritance. I can testify that, for the most part, my inheritance has come to me in this way. When the enemy is defeated through the Word, I gain gold and silver as my heritage.</p><h2 class="head2">S. Hiding It in Their Heart</h2><p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.&rdquo; Treasure should be hidden. However, many people like to display their wealth instead of concealing it. This way is not the biblical way. According to the Bible, we should hide our treasure. We should treasure God&rsquo;s Word and hide it in our heart.</p><h2 class="head2">T. Remembering It and Not Forgetting It</h2><p>Verse 52 indicates that the writer of Psalm 119 remembered God&rsquo;s Word. If we hide the Word in our heart, we shall remember it. To remember the Word is to call back, to recall, our enjoyment of it. The psalmists certainly were busy in handling the Word of God. They mused upon it, considered it, hid it in their heart, and remembered it.</p><p>In verse 16 the psalmist declares, &ldquo;I will not forget thy word,&rdquo; and in verse 93 he says, &ldquo;I will never forget thy precepts.&rdquo; We need to exercise ourselves not to forget the Word of God. It is difficult to remember the Word, but it is easy to forget it. We may hear many rich messages from the Word and in a very short period of time forget them all. Therefore, we need to exercise ourselves to remember God&rsquo;s Word and not forget it.</p>
