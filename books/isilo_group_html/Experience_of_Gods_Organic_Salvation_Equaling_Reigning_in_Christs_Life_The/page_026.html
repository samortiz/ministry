IN PRESENTING OUR BODIES<br />TO LIVE THE BODY LIFE</h2><p>By reigning in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness and taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness, we are able to present our bodies to live the Body life (Rom. 12&mdash;13).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Exceptionally Practical<br />in Presenting Our Bodies to Live the Body Life</h2><p>In presenting our bodies to live the Body life, we need to be exceptionally practical. Living the Body life is something very practical; it is neither vain nor empty. All the other things that the worldly people are doing will eventually be vanity and emptiness. Only the work which we are carrying out in God&rsquo;s eternal economy is not a vain concept or an empty doctrine or belief; it is practical and substantial.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Exceptionally Abounding<br />in Presenting Our Bodies to Live the Body Life</h2><p>In presenting our bodies to live the Body life, we need to be exceptionally abounding. The Body life is neither poor nor monotonous but rich in content and reality. The following seven items are ways for us to be abounding in the Body life.</p><h2 class="head3">1. To Present Our Bodies</h2><p>To live the Body life in a practical and abounding way, first, we need to present our bodies (12:1). We human beings exist in time. When we present our bodies, naturally we present our time and offer our entire being.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Be Renewed in Our Mind</h2><p>After presenting our bodies, we need to have our mind renewed (vv. 2-3). The renewing of the mind is the base for the transformation of our soul; it makes us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the practice of the Body life.</p><h2 class="head3">3. To Exercise Our Gifts</h2><p>Romans 12:4-8 shows us that in the Body of Christ we have received gifts different from one another; there are those who prophesy, those who serve, those who teach, those who exhort, those who give, those who lead, and those who show mercy. Although our gifts are different, we all function according to our respective gifts as normal, proper, rich, organic, functioning members. Thus, the Body life is exceptionally abounding and intensified.</p><h2 class="head3">4. To Live a Life of the Highest Virtues</h2><p>Romans 12:9-21 is a long section in which a life of the highest virtues is described. We need to live out the highest virtues of Christ in our dealings with others, with God, with ourselves, with the persecutor and enemy, and in general, before all men. Such a complete and proper life is a life of surpassing quality with an excellent issue.</p><h2 class="head3">5. To Be Subject to Authorities</h2><p>Romans 13:1-7 deals with subjection to authorities. Man is rebellious in his natural character, but a transformed person is submissive. Apparently, subjection to authorities is related only to the government, but as those who live the normal church life, we should have a proper relationship with the government that we may live the church life in peace and security.</p><h2 class="head3">6. To Practice Love</h2><p>We must also practice love in presenting our bodies to live the Body life (vv. 8-10). Only love prevails. We love, however, because God first loved us. The love of God is wrought into us that we may live it out (1 John 4:10-11).</p><h2 class="head3">7. To Live a Watchful Life</h2><p>We live a watchful life in the Body life (Rom. 13:11-14). We do not live a befuddled and confused life; rather, we have been raised from sleep to be those who are watching and waiting.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of God's Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ's Life &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
