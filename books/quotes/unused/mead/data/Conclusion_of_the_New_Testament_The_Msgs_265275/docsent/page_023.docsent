   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, "heart of the earth," "lower parts of the earth," "Hades," and "Paradise" are synonymous terms, referring to the one place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see that Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people Deut 18:15, 18 , is greater than Jonah the prophet.</S>
