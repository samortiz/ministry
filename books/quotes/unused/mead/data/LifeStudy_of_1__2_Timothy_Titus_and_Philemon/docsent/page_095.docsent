   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Philemon 16 makes this relationship very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Onesimus Paul says, "No longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through regeneration Onesimus had become more than a slave and even more than a free man, for he had become a beloved brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now Onesimus had a relationship with Philemon "both in the flesh and in the Lord": in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the flesh Onesimus was a brother as a slave, and in the Lord he was a slave as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Philemon, therefore, had to receive Onesimus and embrace him in a loving, intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, he was to receive him not in the old man, the old social system, but in Christ and in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Onesimus was still Philemon's slave, in Christ he had become Philemon's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now, in the new man, Philemon had to receive Onesimus as a brother and one of equal status.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see Paul's recommendation of a brother for acceptance in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the book of Philemon there is no mention of the expression "the new man."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as we examine the situation portrayed in this book, we see that Paul was recommending a brother not to a local church in the city where he was at the time, but to a local church in a remote city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that Paul's recommendation took place within the sphere of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have already indicated, this can be proved by Colossians 3:11, where we are told that in the new man there is no bond or free.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Paul was writing to Philemon, he may have been thinking something like this: "Onesimus has become a dear brother in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now I wish to recommend him, a slave, to a brother who is a free man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I want to help them both realize that as brothers they are equal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One should be received, and the other must be willing to receive him."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what I mean in saying that the Epistle to Philemon is an illustration of the equal status of the believers in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as we see that the believers have an equal status in the new man, there will be no problems among us concerning social rank, nationality, or race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We shall have no problems with different peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who discriminate among people in any way do not practice the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would have the genuine church life, we must receive all the saints regardless of race, nationality, or social rank.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a fact that in many places believers are not willing to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, they cannot have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should never speak of a church according to race or color there is no white church, yellow church, black church, or brown church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church has only one color, and that color is heavenly blue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After you come into the church life, there must not be deep in your being any discrimination between believers on the basis of race or color.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as such a discrimination exists within you, as far as you are concerned, you are nullifying the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The colors which represent the different races have already been nullified by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we must be willing to pay the price to have them nullified in the real and genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In society distinctions are still made on the basis of color, nationality, or social status.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But no such distinctions can exist in the church, in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The old man has been divided by these distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in the new man distinctions on the basis of color have been nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul strongly taught this, and we must consider it part of the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Again and again we have pointed out that in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus the full knowledge of the truth concerns the content of God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we still make distinctions on the basis of color, race, or nationality, in this matter we are reprobate concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not hold the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a Jew, it was not easy for Paul to say that in the new man there cannot be any Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But because this was part of the full knowledge of the truth, he declared it plainly and taught it clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the full knowledge of the truth, in the universe there is one new man, one Body of Christ, and one church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, there should be only one local church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all need to realize this aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Lord's sovereignty, the Epistle to Philemon was written before the Epistles to Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in the arrangement of the books in the New Testament, Philemon was placed at the end of this group of four books.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These books reveal the practice of God's New Testament economy, and Philemon shows us a particular aspect of that practice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the practice of the economy of God, it is crucial that all social ranks and differences among races and nations are swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If these ranks and distinctions are allowed to exist in the church life, the new man will be nullified, and the proper church life will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How wonderful that in the New Testament there is a little book which tells us about a slave who was brought to the Lord and brought into the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this book had told us that Caesar Nero had been saved, I would not appreciate it as much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this book tells that a slave, one regarded by the Roman social system as little more than an animal with no legal rights, was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may think that it was not worthwhile for Paul to even write about him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Others may say that it is sufficient for a slave to be saved and to have the assurance of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul, however, exercised great wisdom in writing this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Never has there been another letter written in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why did Paul exercise such a loving concern over a slave who had been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did so because he was burdened to illustrate that among all the saints and all the local churches, the believers are equal in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Onesimus and Philemon are a good illustration of this equality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Surely it was sovereign of God that Onesimus was saved in prison through Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was the salvation of Onesimus that afforded Paul the opportunity to give such a marvelous illustration concerning the life of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He could point out that a slave, then in Rome, and his master, far away in Colosse, were equal as believers in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul knew that, for the sake of his conscience, he had to care for Onesimus in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul knew Philemon and his family very well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps Paul said to himself, "Now Philemon's slave has been saved through me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What shall I do with him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Shall I send him back to his master?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And what shall I say to Philemon about Onesimus?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, this was a very important matter, arranged sovereignly by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No other illustration could better portray the nullification of the difference of status in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The case of Onesimus and Philemon illustrates to the uttermost that in the new man all the believers have an equal status.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Oh, it is crucial that we see this!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Praise the Lord for the salvation of Onesimus, and praise the Lord for this illustration of our equal status in the new man!</S>
