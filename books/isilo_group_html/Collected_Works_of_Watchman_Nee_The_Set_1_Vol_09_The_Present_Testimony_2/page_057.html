For now, we only need to know how our sins and unrighteousness are forgiven before God, and how they are absolved and forgotten. Brothers and sisters, we have to know the difference and the distinction between the sins before God and the sin within us. Let me illustrate: Romans 1 through 5:20 is about our sins before God. The sin within man is not mentioned in this portion. Although chapter five mentions the sin of Adam, it is not significant. The whole of Romans 1 through 5 covers our sins before God. This is why it mentions the blood; the blood cleanses us from our sins before God. However, from the last verse in chapter five until chapter eight, the sin within man is detailed. Therefore, this portion never mentions that the blood cleanses our flesh or the sin in our hearts. Instead, it says that the cross has crucified our old man and that the body of sin is unemployed, so that we are no longer slaves to sin.</P><P>We are not speaking about overcoming sin. This is not my topic today. I am just briefly mentioning our sins before God. This sin gives us no peace and gives us a hard time. When we think about this sin, we begin to wonder if we are accepted before God and if God has forgiven us. We begin to wonder if a person who sins as much as we do can stand before God. This sin is completely different from the sin within us. The sin within us can tempt us and snatch us away to sin. It is a law, a power that will seize us and force us to do what we do not want to do. If we do not have the strength to oppose it, we will be blown down like feeble grass in the face of the strong wind and tossed back and forth. We will be captured by something in our heart and forced to do something against our will. We cannot escape its hand. Many Christians doubt if they are even saved because of this experience. Since they still practice many filthy sins, they wonder how they can be saved. They feel this way because they have failed to realize the distinction between the sin within man and the sins before God. Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus is fully cleansed of their sins before God and forgiven. But the sin within them is as filthy and evil as before. The two things are different. The Lord's blood can cleanse us from our sins before God, but it cannot remove the sin within us.</P><P>We have said before that the blood is objective while the cross is subjective. The blood can only redeem us from our sins before God. It takes the cross to deal with the sin within us. As those who have been the slaves of sin, we surely know about the power of sin. When we believe in Jesus as our Savior, the sins we have before God are washed away by the blood of the Lord. But we are still easily tempted to commit the worst sins. This causes us to doubt whether or not we have been saved.</P><P>The Bible clearly separates these two aspects of sins. We have said before that the sin within us was dealt with when the old man was crucified. As long as we stand on this fact by faith, we will fully overcome sin. But now we are speaking of the forgiveness of our sins before God. We all have to admit that we are unclean sinners. If we do not acknowledge that we are sinners, we have never been enlightened by the Holy Spirit. This is the reason that some do not feel the need for salvation. The first thing that the prodigal son said to the father when he returned home was not that he had sore hands or feet, or that he was cold or hungry, or that he had gone through many hardships. The first thing that he said was a confession. He said that he had sinned against heaven and against his father (Luke 15:21). He had a sense of sin. When we are saved, the first thing that we tell God is not that we are poor and deprived, but that we have sinned against Him. Unless the Holy Spirit works in our hearts, we will not know how pitiful and evil we are, and what sinful and wicked sinners we are. We will not realize our dangerous and pitiful position. Only when we pass through God's enlightening work will we admit that we are sinners. Then we will realize that we are in a dangerous position. Before we were saved, we all felt that we were better and stronger than others. We felt that others were black, but that we alone were white. We have to be enlightened before we will realize that we are great sinners. Only then will we deeply regret our past acts, and only then will we be filled with self-condemnation and remorse, hating and abhorring our own lives. Only then will we know what sin is and how evil it is. We will realize that there is a barrier between us and God, and that we cannot draw near to God or communicate with Him. We are contrary to God, and we do not know how to be reconciled to Him. We only know that we are sinners. Every saved person has to pass through this point. Only then will we receive the gospel when it is preached to us. After this, when we believe and receive, we are saved.</P><P>Before a man is saved, he surely feels the heavy and unbearable burden of sin. He surely realizes the terrible punishment for sin and the seriousness of his own sins. When the Holy Spirit begins to work in his heart, he realizes that something has gone wrong between him and God, and he readily believes in Christ. The gospel he hears may not be that clear, and he may only know that he is saved if he believes in Jesus. He may not hear a detailed explanation from others until after he is saved. But the one or two words that he hears begin to work within him and cause him to realize that this is salvation and this is the gospel. The words cause him to believe and receive. Even though he may not fully understand this teaching, he is willing to commit his whole being to the word of the truth and trust in it for his salvation. Later, after much studying, learning, and research, he begins to understand the process and procedure of salvation. He begins to understand the preciousness and wonder of this teaching. This is the experience of most of us. When we first believed, we may not have understood how a man could be saved just by faith, and we may not have understood many other truths in the Bible. But after we were saved, and after passing through a long period of time, we become clear about how a man is saved by faith.</P><P>According to His holy nature, the righteous and holy God has to judge sin. His righteous life makes it mandatory for Him to judge and condemn all unrighteousness. His word says that all those who sin will die and that those who do such things cannot live. Now we have sinned and committed unrighteousness, and He has to condemn us according to the law. As far as His nature is concerned, He is a holy God and cannot allow anyone who has sinned to live. As far as His acts are concerned, He is a righteous God, and He will make sure that all who have sinned will die. As far as God Himself is concerned, He is a God of glory and sinners cannot draw near to Him because they will die. God has to act according to His principle of righteousness, holiness, and glory. God Himself is glorious and beyond the description of human language. This is the reason that it only says in the Old Testament when God entered the temple, that His glory filled the temple. When God's glory is manifested, we have to stand back because we are filled with defilement, and God is absolutely holy. We cannot draw near to God. In the Old Testament the Israelites could only enter the tabernacle when they were atoned by the blood. When God acts according to His principle of righteousness, holiness, and glory, no one can come near to Him. Thank and praise the Lord, the blood has come, and we can now draw near to Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
