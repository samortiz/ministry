   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ECONOMY 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:23, 14-15; 2 Cor 1:21; 1 John 1:20-27; 5:6; John 14:16-20; Phil 1:19b-21a; Rom 6:5; Col 2:12; Eph 3:16-19; 4:3-6; Rom 6:19b, 22b; 15:16b; 1 Thes 5:23; 2 Pet 1:4b; Titus 3:5; Eph 4:23; Rom 12:2a; 6:4; Hosea 14:8</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, because He has been compounded with the elements of divinity, humanity, Christ's death with its effectiveness, and Christ's resurrection with its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible tells us that, after passing through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His becoming a life-giving Spirit is the consummation of all the processes He has passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At least four thousand years after He created man, the complete God entered into a "tunnel," a process.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This "tunnel," this process, was quite long and had at least four sections.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first section of the "tunnel" was incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Incarnation, as Isaiah shows us in chapter fifty-three, included His human living and lasted thirty-three and a half years in addition to the nine months He was in the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second section was His all-inclusive death, which, strictly speaking, lasted only six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the preparation for His death lasted at least one week.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before His crucifixion, He went to Jerusalem voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the types and prophecies in the Old Testament, He had to be cut off on the day of the Passover Exo 12:3-6 and in that particular year Dan 9:25-26 .</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>24-27 could not have been properly fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He knew the year, He knew the month, and He knew the day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, He went to Jerusalem according to the foreordained date.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He entered into Jerusalem and stayed there for one week, including the day of His death John 12:1; see note 1 in Mark 12:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, it took Him at least one week to pass through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In those six days prior to His death, He was dying there; He was being slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To kill Him was not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before being arrested, He was tested by several groups of people, including the chief priests, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Herodians, the scribes, and the elders.</S>
