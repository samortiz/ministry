<h1 class="title">THE THREE SUBSTANCES OF THE POWER<br />
IN THE RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 1:8; 4:31; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<p>The book of Acts begins with the one accord and stresses the one accord. The early disciples could not have maintained or kept this one accord, however, if they had had different ways, means, agents, or substances for them to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth. If we read through the entire book of Acts, we can see that the way they took to carry out God&rsquo;s move on this earth to fulfill His New Testament economy was entirely by three main substances&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Not only in Acts but also throughout the entire New Testament, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word were used for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. The different groups in Christianity today use many other ways. This is why I do not feel that it would be a profit to the move of the Lord in the recovery to establish schools or other things like this. This might be a distraction that keeps the churches somewhat different. If we have different ways to do things, it is hard to keep the one accord. In order to maintain the unique one accord we all have to learn to do the same thing by the same way. The substances which constitute the unique way for the Lord&rsquo;s move are prayer and the Spirit, which result in the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD GROWING AND MULTIPLYING</h2>
<p>Acts never tells us that the Spirit grew and multiplied but that the Word grew and multiplied. There are three sections in the book of Acts concerning the move of the Lord through His Word. Chapter six is the end of the first section where it says the word of God grew (v. 7). Chapter twelve is the end of the second section and tells us that &ldquo;the word of God grew and multiplied&rdquo; (v. 24). Then Paul&rsquo;s ministry began in chapter thirteen. Finally, chapter nineteen is the end of another section, telling us that &ldquo;the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord&rsquo;s move eventually is not to have something resulting in the Spirit. What we do actually is to carry the Word to people. The Word is the real contents, the real constituents of the New Testament economy of God. God&rsquo;s Word constitutes the New Testament Bible and also constitutes the very New Testament economy of God. We should pray that we may have the Spirit as power to spread the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GETTING CONSTITUTED WITH THE WORD</h2>
<p>We have to pick up the Word to an even greater extent than Peter did. Peter probably did not have a share, as we do, in the fourteen Epistles written by Paul and in the book of Revelation written by John. This is why he charged the saints in his later ministry to take whatever the Apostle Paul wrote (2 Pet. 3:15-16). In John 16 the Lord told Peter and all his companions that He had many things to say to them which they could not have borne at that time. He said that they had to wait for the Spirit of reality to come for further speaking (vv. 12-13). Mostly, the Holy Spirit spoke in continuation of the Lord Jesus through Paul on the New Testament economy of God. The word spoken by the Lord Himself directly to Peter is mostly in the four Gospels. After Pentecost, the Lord spoke to all His people mainly through the Apostle Paul in his Epistles. Peter with all his companions had to pick up mainly what was recorded in the Gospels, but today we have to pick up much more. We have to pick up the words of the Lord from the four Gospels and especially from the fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul. After giving Life-study Messages on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, the first thing we published in collective volumes was our Life-studies on Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles because we consider that his Epistles are more crucial for us to know God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>For us to know the Lord Jesus in His earthly ministry we surely need the four Gospels. To know His birth, His youth, His living and ministry on this earth, His death, resurrection, and ascension we have to pick up the record in the four Gospels. But for us to know the definition, the full revelation, of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning the Body of Christ, we surely have to pick up the fourteen Epistles of Paul. The four Gospels show us the Head, while Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles show us the Body and reveal the Head to us in an even deeper way. Because we are living in the Body today under the direction of Christ as our living Head, these fourteen Epistles are more crucial to us.</p>
<p>I charged the new full-timers in Taiwan to spend half a day, every day, in the Word. This is a must. Even when they were out preaching the gospel to the villages, they still spent the first half of the day praying together in the Word. They even brought their Life-studies with them. They always study the Word regularly according to their schedule. If these young ones do not have an adequate constitution of the Word, they will have nothing to present to others regardless of how much they pray. But the full-timers in Taiwan have something when they open up their mouth because they have been studying the New Testament in the Recovery Version with all the notes and the Life-study Messages. They are full of the divine revelation. They are full of the divine Word. They have much to say, and this is quite convincing when they meet other Christians. They open up the Recovery Version and give away some booklets and Life-studies; thus, many get attracted and would even like a copy of the Recovery Version for themselves.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 07: One Accord for the Lord's Move &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
