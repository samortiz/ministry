   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Present Meetings and Services Creating Unlimited Opportunities for the Saints to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The meetings and services in the past did not create enough opportunities for the saints to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past, on the one hand, we brought people to be regenerated and to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, we took away their opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today, everywhere abounds with opportunity, from preaching the gospel by visitation, through the home meetings, to the small group meetings and the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time, the Lord's grace is waiting there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not know how to take care of a home meeting or a small group meeting, the church has the direction, and everyone can learn together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the district meetings, everyone can prophesy, speaking the Lord's word and speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if you say that you cannot do it, there is grace waiting for you to learn and to pick it up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, many brothers and sisters who have been saved for only half a year have been standing up to prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words they release are very fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At present, opportunity to serve abounds everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The practice of the new way also affords the saints a chance to let out a breath of life, which is their desire to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young, it was difficult to find an opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I attended worship services from my youth until I was twenty-six years old.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During that time, no one ever asked me to pray, and I never dared to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was twenty-six, I attended a Bible study meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An older brother there who knew me realized that I loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During one of the meetings, he called my name and asked me to offer a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, I was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the other hand, I felt privileged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every one of us who is saved and loves the Lord has a desire to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a breath which we are ready to let out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now the practice of the new way enables us to let out this breath of desire for serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>MEETING THE LORD'S PRESENT NEED</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to meet the Lord's present need, we must first recall our past experiences and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe all of you have had some experiences and some vision in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we have to recall them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, we have to respond to the Lord's attraction and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fact that you are here today proves that the Lord has attracted you from within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this attraction there is a calling that calls us to meet the need of the Lord in the new way today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, we have to renew our past commitment and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past, many of us have had a heart for the Lord and have consecrated ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we need to have these renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fourth, we need to set aside some time and specifically budget our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to set down some guidelines for our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our daily lives, we should set aside some time for the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fifth, we have to meet the different needs of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are the following four needs:</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1 Visit people to preach the gospel and to gain new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The practice of knocking on doors to visit people for the preaching of the gospel is absolutely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It should not be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only problem is that in the past few years we have knocked on too many doors and have saved too many people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need a time of digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2 Regularly and consistently help the new ones in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To help the new ones to have home meetings is a work that needs to be done regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should visit them at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3 Diligently learn to help the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All who have worked in the communities know that it is not easy to conduct a home meeting or a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Especially the young saints, whose experience in the human life is not rich, find it hard to help others when family and marriage problems are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to learn all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this purpose, the church also should give training of all kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4 Pursue seriously functioning and prophesying in the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This also requires a lot of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now that we have the New Testament Recovery Version, it should help us somewhat in prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, in the Chinese Recovery Version there is a footnote to John 3:16 for the word "world."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day I came across this footnote and was very much impressed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This note describes man from his fall, with the poison of the serpent injected into him, until the New Jerusalem, where he becomes God's eternal expression.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should first study such a note at home and digest it a little.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then practice speaking it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way, you will be able to function and to prophesy when you come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our life is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our goal is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The result is the reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the glorious life and the glorious goal for those saints who practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on May 22, 1988</S>
