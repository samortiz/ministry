   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One Locality with One Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, we must see clearly before God that in the Bible there is one locality with one church, or in short, one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we study the matter of the church, we must be able to understand this principle of one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every mistake comes from violating this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One locality, one church is the pendulum.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When it swings to one side, it is wrong because it causes three or four localities to have one church or the whole world to have one church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When it swings to the opposite side, it is also wrong because it causes one locality to have several or many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is something abnormal in connection with the locality, or there is something abnormal in connection with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible there is one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time of the apostles, the population of the city of Jerusalem was about one million.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was one of the most highly populated cities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many localities in China today are still not as highly populated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time three thousand people were saved and then five thousand Acts 2:41; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The number of the saved eventually reached several tens of thousands of people 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was really unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since there was no place large enough for them to meet together, they met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the Bible does not speak of "the churches in Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I doubt whether they could easily find a meeting place large enough for three to five thousand to gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It may be that all these people did not meet together even once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It could be that they met in the wilderness; we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the city was very large and there were many believers, they were still one church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the Bible shows us one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen clearly that the Roman Catholic Church has swung to one side with the principle of having one church with many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another group of people are on the other side with the principle of one locality having many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same locality, you are one church and others are another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is congregationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is enough to love those in the same congregation and not care for the other congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Open Brethren have gone in the direction of the congregational church; the Closed Brethren have gone in the direction of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we face a huge problem in China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must maintain a testimony against the work of the Roman Catholic Church on one hand and the work of congregational churches on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are just a little careless, congregationalism will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are clear that there is one locality, one church, then we will be clear about Roman Catholicism and congregationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, Sian is a locality; therefore, there should be one church there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless of whether the church in Sian is good or bad, it is the one church there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I am right with the brothers in Sian, I am in the church in Sian; if I am not right with the brothers in Sian, I am still in the church in Sian.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now let us see the consequences of congregationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I am a believer of congregationalism and I am right with the brothers, then I will break bread with them; if I am not, we will break bread separately because you love your group and I love my group.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of breaking of bread costs nothing; it is unnecessary to hire a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can just set up a table as we like and break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can form another church, love one another, wash one another's feet from morning to evening, have a love feast at every meal, and have very good fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Bible says one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible says that "we the saints in the same locality who are many are one bread" 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You, being few, are two loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You say, "We are one loaf and you also are a loaf" this is congregationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a dreadful situation for the church once congregationalism appears.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Roman Catholicism over a period of eleven hundred years had but one church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If congregationalism exists for a period of eleven hundred years, there may be hundreds and thousands of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who like contentions always seek causes of contention.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose I am contentious and have found a brother to contend with.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The contention will end in a division.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then I will suffer because I will have no one to contend with; so I will look for someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is appalling; the church will not only be divided into many pieces but will also advocate divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the principle is wrong, difficulties will follow: once a disagreement occurs, you will set up a table and another will set up another table.</S>
