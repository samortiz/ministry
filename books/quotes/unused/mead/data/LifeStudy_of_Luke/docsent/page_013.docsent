   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Praising God s Mercy and His Mighty Doings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:48-50 Mary says, Because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed; because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name; and His mercy is unto generations and generations to those who fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both Mary and Zachariah stress God s mercy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>54, 58, 72, 78 , realizing their low estate v. 48 and humbly v. 52 recognizing that they are not worthy of being favored by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both God s mercy and His grace are the expression of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy first reaches us and brings us into a situation where God is able to favor us with His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, 15:20-24 tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is mercy, as expressing the father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is grace, which also manifests the father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s mercy reaches further and bridges the gap between us and God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a sense, Mary was more knowledgeable of God than many believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In her praise she speaks of God s mercy, but she does not mention His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to receive God s grace, we need to be in a suitable condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Mary realized that she and all the people at that time were in a poor condition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because they were in a pitiful condition, they needed God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mary praised God for His mercy and His mighty doings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verses 51 and 52 she says, He has done mighty things with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He brought down potentates from thrones and exalted the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God did mighty things in taking care of His people in their low estate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because their estate was so low, they needed God s mercy to reach them, for His mercy extends further than His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1:53-55 Mary says, He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He sent away empty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has succored Israel His servant to remember mercy, even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 55 refers to God s faithfulness in keeping His word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both Mary and Zachariah emphasize not only God s mercy but also His faithfulness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>70, 72 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s mercy takes care of their condition, and His faithfulness takes care of His position so that He can favor them with His gracious doings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were His faithful word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now God was visiting His people according to those promises.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should appreciate Mary s praise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When she uttered this praise, she was a young woman, probably still in her twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though she was so young, she could offer up a praise that was a composition of quotations from the Old Testament related to her own experience of God as her Savior and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She could speak concerning God s mercy and His mighty doings in caring for His people according to the faithful promises given to the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we consider Mary s praise, we can see something of the reason she was chosen by God for the conception of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt Mary also taught the Lord Jesus many portions from the Scriptures as He was growing up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Mary s praise is not doctrinal; on the contrary, it is experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She praised God from her experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Mary said that her spirit exulted in God her Savior and her soul magnified the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was based on experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then she went on to praise God in His mercy and in His faithful doings in taking care of His people, who were in a low estate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s doings were according to His promise, according to His faithful word given to the fathers.</S>
