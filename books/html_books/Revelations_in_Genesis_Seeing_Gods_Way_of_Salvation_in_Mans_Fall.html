<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>For three months, beginning from October 1954, Brother Witness Lee conducted a life training in which one of the classes considered the line of life in the whole Bible. The messages in the first part have been published in the book <em>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God&rsquo;s Desire and Purpose in Creation.</em> This book is a collection of edited records from the second part of that study of Genesis.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:16&mdash;3:6</h1>
<p>The record of God&rsquo;s creation in the first two chapters of Genesis reveals God&rsquo;s desire and purpose, and it reveals the procedure with which God achieves His purpose. These two chapters can be considered as a picture of the whole Bible. When God spoke the content of the Bible, He first presented a picture to show His eternal purpose, the procedure of His work, and the issue of His work. After this, Genesis 3 can be considered the beginning of the official narration of man&rsquo;s history in the Bible. Regrettably, however, this narration begins with the fall of man. Immediately after presenting a picture of His creation, God presents the fall of man.</p>
<p>We will first consider the source of man&rsquo;s fall, that is, the cause of the fall of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAUSE OF THE FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Serpent&rsquo;s Temptation</h2>
<p>The first cause of the fall of man was the serpent&rsquo;s temptation. Without the serpent&rsquo;s temptation and deception, man would not have fallen. The serpent that tempted man was the incarnation of Satan. Apparently, he was a serpent; actually, he was Satan. Satan hid in the serpent in order to tempt man. Therefore, Revelation 12:9 says, &ldquo;The ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Genesis 3:1, the serpent was made by Jehovah. We should not think that because the serpent is bad, he was not made by God or that what God made cannot become the incarnation of Satan. In the universe only God is life. Anything that is not of God or is severed from God, even though it was made by God, can be in the principle of the serpent; that is, it can be usurped by Satan to be his incarnation.</p>
<p>Some thank and praise the Lord for blessing them, for giving them an education, or for giving them intelligence. Others thank and praise the Lord for giving them a good spouse and good children. We should acknowledge that such things are from the Lord, but we must not forget that if these God-given persons, matters, and things are severed from God, they can be an embodiment of Satan and can be used by Satan.</p>
<p>The serpent was made by God, but in Genesis 3 the serpent was used by Satan, who hid within him, thus making the serpent the incarnation of Satan. This serpent was not only attractive but also cunning. Anyone who is cunning and clever is crafty. Dull people are not crafty, but clever people are inevitably crafty. Nearly every clever person is crafty. Being attractive, cunning, and clever are related to being crafty. Some people are very clever and considerate of others, but they are like &ldquo;sly old foxes&rdquo; and may have poison in them. Therefore, we must be watchful and guard ourselves against things that are attractive to us, for they can be the embodiment of Satan. Satan often hides within these things to tempt and deceive man.</p>
<p>How did the serpent tempt Eve? The serpent might have wrapped himself around the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in order to tempt Eve. When Eve noticed the serpent, she also noticed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The serpent tempted Eve by asking a question, which caused her to doubt God&rsquo;s word. The first question in the Bible came out of Satan&rsquo;s mouth. A great American evangelist, Dr. Haldeman, once said that when the serpent tempted Eve that day, saying to Eve, &ldquo;Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?&rdquo; (v. 1), he might have shaped himself into a hook, a question mark. This is quite meaningful. All questions originate from Satan. When man accepted that question, he fell into the hand of Satan and became fallen.</p>
<p>The serpent asked a question, which caused Eve to doubt God&rsquo;s word. God commanded man, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (2:17). However, Satan asked, &ldquo;Did God really say...?&rdquo; (3:1), and then said, &ldquo;You shall not surely die!&rdquo; (v. 4). Man accepted Satan&rsquo;s question, doubted God&rsquo;s word, and dared to take the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and to eat it. To this day Satan uses this method to tempt man to sin or to instigate man to reject God&rsquo;s salvation. Man needs to know how steadfast the Lord&rsquo;s word is: &ldquo;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away&rdquo; (Luke 21:33). The Lord&rsquo;s word is not yes and no (2 Cor. 1:19-20).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the serpent&rsquo;s question caused man to doubt God&rsquo;s heart. The serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil&rdquo; (Gen. 3:5). The serpent wanted the woman to believe that God was deceiving them by forbidding them to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lest, like God, they would know good and evil. This is another of the sinister schemes that Satan often uses. People are far away from God and will not come to God, because they have been fooled by Satan to misunderstand God&rsquo;s love and not know God&rsquo;s heart.</p><h2 class="head2">The Woman&rsquo;s Assuming of the Headship</h2>
<p>In addition to the serpent&rsquo;s temptation, there was another cause of man&rsquo;s fall: the woman&rsquo;s assuming of the headship. Did God create one man or two? Some say that God created two people. This is not correct; God created one man. Eve was built with Adam&rsquo;s rib (2:22); hence, Eve&rsquo;s head was Adam. Therefore, there was only one head, not two. God did not create two people when He created man; He did not take one lump of dust to create Adam and another lump to create Eve. He created one man, Adam, from one lump of dust, took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side and built it into Eve, and put the two together to be one flesh (vv. 7, 21-24). Thus, there were not two but one.</p>
<p>Weddings are held all over the world, but few people understand their significance. Whether a wedding ceremony is modern or traditional, Chinese or Western, there is only one head. Why is only one head exposed when there are two people? Why does the woman cover her head? In my childhood I saw traditional Chinese weddings in which the bride covered her whole head. When the couple bowed to heaven and earth, I saw only one head, not two. Today people are accustomed to modern wedding ceremonies, but most brides, whether Chinese or Western, wear a veil. They wear a veil to declare that henceforth, in this new household, there are not two heads; rather, there is only one head. If both the husband and the wife are heads, they will fight and then divorce. Just as a country cannot have two rulers, a household cannot have two heads. When a sister gets married, she must let her husband be the head. Please do not misunderstand me and think that I am advocating men&rsquo;s rights for the brothers. This is not the case. I want you to know God&rsquo;s ways.</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese weddings the bride cannot tread on the ground when she goes from her household to her groom&rsquo;s household. The bride is usually carried from her room by her older brother to her bridal sedan chair. When she arrives at her groom&rsquo;s household, a felt carpet is spread for her as she gets out of her sedan chair. The groom may tread on the ground, but the bride may not. Although this practice is a Chinese tradition, it is very meaningful. The bride cannot tread on the ground, because she has no position on earth. Eve&rsquo;s position was in Adam; her position was Adam&rsquo;s side, and Adam was her head.</p>
<p>This word may anger the sisters; they may think that I am belittling the position of women. In this age of respecting women&rsquo;s rights in the twentieth century, to say that women have no position and that the man is the head of the woman sounds like a backward theory. I hope the sisters understand that this is not my word; this is the word of the Bible. There are many examples of this in the Bible. In Numbers 1 the children of Israel were numbered, but the Bible does not say how many males and how many females there were; it gives only the number of males, not females (v. 2). In the Gospels the Lord Jesus fed the crowd with five loaves and two fish. The Bible says that there were about five thousand men, apart from women and children (Matt. 14:19-21; Mark 6:41-44). In God&rsquo;s household registration there are only men, not women, because on the wedding day the woman&rsquo;s head is covered when she is given to the man, and the man becomes her head. The most beautiful condition between a couple is the husband being the head and the wife submitting to the headship. Such a household is sweet and will last. Everything has its God-given position; this is not a matter of equality or inequality.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago I met an educated sister who was not convinced concerning this matter, even though she had read it in the Bible and heard messages related to it. She said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, does this saying in the Bible not value the male and belittle the female? Is this not gender inequality?&rdquo; I answered her with a smile, saying, &ldquo;The eyebrow is above the eye, and the eye is below the eyebrow. Would the eye say that the eyebrow is valued but the eye is belittled? Would moving the eye above the eyebrow be equality?&rdquo; She smiled when she heard this. I said, &ldquo;Sister, do not contend over this matter. The eye has its position, and the eyebrow has its position. The positions that God has arranged are beautiful. Would it look good for the eye to be moved above the eyebrow?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;This is an arrangement that we are accustomed to. Later we may discover that it looks better.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The eye is below the eyebrow not only for good looks but for use. I know this because I sweat a lot. Without these two &lsquo;sweatwalls,&rsquo; I would not be able to open my eyes. Even if I sweat profusely, sweat will not get into my eyes. Even if I do not wipe away my sweat for two hours, sweat still will not enter my eyes. If we moved the eyes above the eyebrows, we would not be able to open our eyes when we sweat. Do you think being a woman is low? The man is often the &lsquo;sweatwall&rsquo; for the woman. The man has his position and function, and the woman has her position and function. When we keep our position, it is beautiful, good, restful, and secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman who does not keep her position is dangerous. Man&rsquo;s fall was caused not by Adam but by Eve. She acted presumptuously and assumed the headship; thus, she made Adam fall and suffered loss herself. Man&rsquo;s fall was due not only to the serpent&rsquo;s temptation but also to the woman&rsquo;s assuming of the headship. The serpent was successful because Adam was not with Eve. Countless disasters in world history were brought about by women, because men were not around. The Lord has shown us how dangerous it is for women to assume the headship. We do not know where Adam went, but he was not with Eve. Had Eve known her position when the serpent spoke to her, she would have said, &ldquo;Hold on, let me get my husband.&rdquo; Eve did not fall when she ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; she fell when she assumed the headship. The serpent was aware that Eve would fall under his control as soon as she assumed the headship. It is a terrible and uncomely thing for a woman to assume the headship.</p>
<p>The sisters should not be angry about this, because even the brothers are women. Before God we all have the position of a woman. Thus, the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship has a symbolic meaning as well. Men are not the head; our head is Christ, God. It is dangerous for us to do something apart from Christ, apart from God. This is the principle of the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship.</p>
<p>Eve was a woman; Adam was a man. Adam was the head; the woman was under the head. This is a symbol, a shadow, that shows the relationship between God and man. The unique Head in the universe is God, and we should be under His authority. Whenever we set God aside, set Christ aside, to deal with anything, we are setting our Adam, our Husband, aside and are assuming the headship. When Satan tempts us, he is afraid of our retreating into the Lord and letting the Lord assume the headship. This is the secret to overcoming. When we retreat and let God be our &ldquo;sweatwall,&rdquo; we overcome. We must remember that when we go beyond God, set God aside, and assume the headship, we have fallen into the hand of the evil one.</p>
<p>This is a great principle. The first fall of mankind involved man&rsquo;s assuming the headship and setting God aside. Contacting something outside of God is the greatest cause of man&rsquo;s failure. We must be watchful, because we are all women. We must not assume the headship in anything; instead, we must let God have the headship. When we retreat into God, we are preserved and we overcome. This is the secret to being preserved and overcoming.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the process and the result of man&rsquo;s first fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF MAN&rsquo;S FIRST FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Not Being Exercised</h2>
<p>The first step in the process of man&rsquo;s first fall was failing to exercise the spirit. Eve assumed the headship and went beyond God because she did not exercise her spirit. God created man with a spirit to contact Him (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8). After man was created, he should have used his spirit to contact God and live before God. Man is preserved by God when he lives according to his spirit, but in the garden man did not exercise his spirit to contact God. Instead, he went beyond God and fell into the hand of the evil one. If man had remembered God&rsquo;s right and authority over him and exercised his spirit to ask God about Satan&rsquo;s words, he would not have gone beyond God and would not have fallen. Therefore, the first step in man&rsquo;s fall involved setting God aside by not exercising the spirit. Going beyond God to contact something outside of God is the first step of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; By saying this, God was making known that man should only pay attention to God, contact God, receive God, and gain God. Man should not pay attention to, contact, receive, or gain anything other than God. Whenever man pays attention to things other than God, he gets into trouble and falls into the hand of the evil one, Satan. Man fell because he neglected this matter, went beyond God, and paid attention to something other than God.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything other than God. God&rsquo;s forbidding man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a serious warning and reminder that man should contact only God; otherwise, his end is death. Man violated this principle in the first step of his fall by going beyond God and paying attention to something other than God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Soul Being Exercised</h2>
<p>The second step in the process of man&rsquo;s first fall was the soul being exercised. When Eve spoke and reasoned with the serpent, she exercised her mind first (3:2-3). This was the second step in her being deceived. Verse 6 then says, &ldquo;When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make oneself wise, she took of its fruit and ate.&rdquo; All these are matters related to the soul. <em>To be desired</em> indicates that her emotion was exercised. <em>To make oneself wise</em> indicates that her mind was exercised, because wisdom belongs to the mind. <em>Took of its fruit and ate</em> indicates that her will, her determination, was exercised. The functions of the mind, emotion, and will in man&rsquo;s soul were all exercised. Thus, the second step in the process of man&rsquo;s fall is the soul being exercised.</p>
<p>The first step of man&rsquo;s fall involved not exercising the spirit. The second step involved exercising the soul. Not exercising the spirit is to go beyond God, and exercising the soul is to assume the headship, because our person is in the soul. In our entire being, the soul represents our person, our personality. When one&rsquo;s soul is exercised, one&rsquo;s person is exercised.</p>
<p>If Eve wanted to contact God, she could not have done so by just exercising her mind, emotion, or will, because the mind, emotion, and will are not faculties for contacting God. Man cannot contact God by exercising his soul; man must exercise his spirit to contact God. If Eve had exercised her spirit instead of her soul, she would not have gone beyond God or assumed the headship. If Eve had said, &ldquo;I will go ask God,&rdquo; when the serpent tempted her, she would have exercised her spirit, not her soul. If she had exercised her spirit, she would not have gone beyond God or assumed the headship. However, because she set God aside, went beyond God, and ignored God, she exercised her soul in her decision to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Man is taking the way of the fall when he uses his soul first, rather than his spirit, in anything. Many people exercise only their soul in their daily living; hence, their way before God is the way of failure. For instance, in the matter of marriage, some young saints do not use their spirit to pray, to have fellowship with God, or to ask God what to do concerning their marriage. They use their soul rather than their spirit. Furthermore, they mainly exercise their emotion, their loving faculty, and then their mind to consider. Only then do they decide. All these are matters related to the soul. A young saint rarely uses his spirit first in order to contact God when proceeding forward in the matter of marriage. If he uses his spirit to contact God first, he will not go beyond God or assume the headship in the matter of his marriage. If he first exercises the faculties of his soul and follows his soul to take the way of the soul&mdash;exercising his emotion to see marriage as desirable, then exercising his mind to consider it as being good, and then determining to proceed according to the resolution of his will&mdash;he will assume the headship and go beyond God. In such a situation, he will fail and fall.</p>
<p>Christians on the proper way should first exercise their spirit in every matter. Once we use our spirit, our soul stops. Once we use our spirit, we contact God and put God first. Rather than assuming the headship, we are safeguarded. This should be the principle not only in our marriage but in every matter, great or small, in our Christian life. Regrettably, many Christians do not live according to this principle; most live according to the fallen principle of exercising only their soul. They begin with their preferences, consider and plan according to their thoughts, and then decide according to their will. All three steps are matters related to the soul. Every time that Satan tempts us, and we exercise our soul instead of our spirit to contact God, Satan succeeds, and we are taking the way of the fall.</p><h2 class="head2">The Body Acting</h2>
<p>The third step in the process of man&rsquo;s first fall was the body acting. Once Eve&rsquo;s soul was exercised, her body responded with action. The soul directs the body. When Eve saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a delight to the eyes and desirable, she decided to take it and eat. Taking and eating the fruit were actions of her body. First, there was a seeing with her eyes. Second, there was a taking with her hands. Third, there was an eating with her mouth. Fourth, there was a giving to her husband. After Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and ate, &ldquo;she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate&rdquo; (v. 6). This may be likened to a wife who plays mah-jongg and brings her husband into playing it as well, or a wife who goes dancing and brings her husband into dancing. Romans 1:32 speaks of such ones, &ldquo;who, though fully knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice them.&rdquo; All sinners not only commit sins themselves but also want others to do the same. If our colleagues like to play mah-jongg, sooner or later they will want us to play mah-jongg. They like it best when we wallow in the same mire. </p>
<p>I came across this kind of temptation when I was young. Some of my friends asked me to play mah-jongg. I did not understand the game at that time, but they said, &ldquo;It does not matter. It is all right if you do not understand.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;What if I lose money?&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;The money you lose is on us; the money you win is yours.&rdquo; Thus, I followed along. It was truly the work of the devil.</p>
<p>I am told that opium smokers also use all kinds of methods to bring others into smoking opium. Sinners all like to bring others along into their sinning. After Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and ate, she gave some to her husband, and her husband ate. Man&rsquo;s first act of sin was then complete.</p>
<p>There are only three steps involved in committing sin. The first step is not using our spirit, that is, going beyond God. Man has three parts: the innermost is the spirit, then there is the soul, and the outermost is the body. We should use our spirit first, let our spirit direct our soul, and then let our soul direct our body. Then we would not sin easily. If, however, we use our soul instead of our spirit, we assume the headship, and our soul is the decision maker. This is the second step. Once the soul becomes the decision maker, it directs the body to do things that offend God. This is the third step. This is the process every time we sin against God. Every offense in God&rsquo;s eyes occurs according to these three steps.</p>
<p>Many Christians do not like to pray about matters in their life. A saint once said to me that he would like to do a certain thing, and he asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do you think I could do it?&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;Have you brought this matter to God first in prayer to see what is His will?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Honestly, I dare not pray. I know that once I pray, God will not want me to do this.&rdquo; Christians have many stories like this, and they are unwilling to pray about many matters. For example, a brother may be unwilling to pray about proceeding with the matter of marriage, because he knows that as soon as he prays, God will not want him to proceed. He, therefore, decides not to pray. Not praying means that he is suppressing his spirit, setting God aside, going beyond God, and assuming the headship. When only his soul, including his mind, emotion, and will, is exercised, he determines the course of his marriage and, as a result, offends God. Without exception, these three steps are involved in all our offenses toward God. This is an ironclad principle.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter a matter, we should ask God reverently from deep within about His feeling, that is, whether there is permission or forbiddance, peace or uneasiness, or joy or sorrow. If the inward sense is one of permission, peace, and joy, then we may do it according to His will. If the inward sense is one of forbiddance without peace or joy, then we should be subdued and, according to His will, not do it. When we are subdued in our spirit, we are subdued before God, preserved from the schemes of Satan, and preserved from falling.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF MAN&rsquo;S FIRST FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Soul Being Corrupted</h2>
<p>The first result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that the soul was corrupted. Even before man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man&rsquo;s soul accepted Satan&rsquo;s words. Satan&rsquo;s words represent Satan himself. When Eve accepted Satan&rsquo;s words by exercising her soul, every part of her soul was exercised, including her mind, emotion, and will. This means that she accepted Satan&rsquo;s words and proposals into every part of her soul. Even though the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had not yet entered into her body, Satan&rsquo;s words, which were Satan himself, had already entered into every part of her soul. Every part of her soul was corrupted and defiled.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s mind was originally pure, and man&rsquo;s will and emotion were pure as well. At that time every part of man&rsquo;s soul was undefiled, unpolluted, and without mixture. Man was simple and pure in his thoughts, emotions, and determinations. However, when Eve accepted Satan&rsquo;s words and opinions, Satan himself entered into man&rsquo;s soul. Thus, man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will were no longer simple but complicated. Furthermore, man&rsquo;s soul was no longer pure; it was polluted and corrupted. The corruption of the soul was the first result of man&rsquo;s fall. Whenever man falls and sins, the soul is the first part that is corrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Body Being Transmuted</h2>
<p>The second result of the first fall is that man&rsquo;s body was transmuted. Once man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the element of that tree entered into his body. Man&rsquo;s body was originally created by God, and it was pure. After man ate of the fruit of that tree, his body was transmuted. To eat is to take something into the body. For man to take in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil means that he took it into his body. Thus, man&rsquo;s body now has the element of Satan in it, which has resulted in its transmutation. Man&rsquo;s body has been transmuted because sin, which is the life of Satan, is in it.</p>
<p>In man&rsquo;s body there is also lust, which is like an addiction. Drinking results in addiction. Smoking results in addiction. Going to the theater and playing mah-jongg are also addictions. As lust, the Bible calls these addictions, which dwell in man&rsquo;s body, sin (Rom. 7:17). Such lust, such sin, dwells in man&rsquo;s body and enslaves man to do many evil things against his desire. I have seen many opium smokers who were miserable beyond description. They knew that they should not smoke opium, and often they determined to never smoke again. Yet their addiction could quickly take over to the point that they were unable to withstand it, and they had no control over themselves. Even though they knew they might die, they could not stop smoking opium. This shows that sin, lust, is in man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>This sin, this lust, entered into man&rsquo;s body when he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Once the element of this tree entered into man&rsquo;s body, his body was changed, transmuted, into the flesh. The body is positive, but the flesh is negative (3:20; 6:19; 7:18, 25). The body is God-created; the flesh is a transmutation of the body.</p>
<p>Once man fell in this way, his body became the flesh. Every kind of corruption is hidden in our body. Therefore, Romans 7:23 says that the law of sin, the power that causes man to sin naturally, is in our members. There is a law of sin in the members of man&rsquo;s body because the element of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil entered into man to corrupt and transmute his body. This is the second result.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being Deadened</h2>
<p>The third result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that the spirit was deadened. The first significance of the spirit being deadened is that it cannot contact God. The spirit was originally an organ for contacting God. Now that the spirit has been defiled and deadened, it cannot contact God. This does not mean that the spirit is gone. The spirit still exists, but it is unable to contact God. For example, man&rsquo;s eyes are able to contact colors, but if an eye is blind, it is dead. Once an eye is dead, it is insulated from colors and unable to contact colors. The spirit is for contacting God. Once the spirit is dead, it is unable to contact God. This is the first significance of a deadened spirit.</p>
<p>The second significance of the spirit being deadened is a loss of function. Once an eye is dead, it is not only cut off from the object of its contact, but because it is blind, it also loses its function. Man&rsquo;s spirit was originally capable of contacting God, worshipping God, having fellowship with God, understanding God&rsquo;s will, and knowing God. When the spirit was deadened, it was cut off from God and lost its function.</p>
<p>In order to know of something&rsquo;s existence, we must have an organ to substantiate it. For example, would a hymnal with a green cover or would a blackboard exist to us if we were blind? We would not sense their existence, because the function of our eyes to substantiate colors has been lost. Although others can see colors, we could not. However, this does not mean that there is no such thing as color; rather, it only means that we cannot substantiate colors, because we have lost the function of our substantiating organ. It is the same with sound. If a person is deaf, he cannot substantiate sound and thus senses no sound. Similarly, if a person loses the function of his nose and tongue, he will not sense the flavor of his food. This does not mean that there is no such thing as flavor but that his substantiating faculties have lost their function. Many people say that there is no God, but this does not mean that there is really no God. It only means that their God-substantiating spiritual sense has been lost because their spirit is deadened. God exists, but they have no sense of Him, just as we will not have a sense of flavor, sound, or color if our faculties lose their function. It is not that these things do not exist but that our ability to substantiate them has been lost.</p>
<p>God is invisible and intangible. God can be contacted only in the spirit. The Bible says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). Man&rsquo;s spirit is dedicated to contacting God, but because man became corrupt, his spirit was insulated and cut off from God. Once it was cut off, its function stopped, and it was deadened.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Constituted a Sinner and<br />
Having a Record of Sin</h2>
<p>The fourth result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that man was constituted a sinner. When man&rsquo;s soul was corrupted, man&rsquo;s body was transmuted, and man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened; his whole person was damaged. This is the condition of a sinner. All the persons in the world are sinners because they have Satan&rsquo;s life within and have been corrupted by Satan. The life of Satan is the sin that dwells in man, the evil that is present with man (Rom. 5:19; 7:17, 20-21). Therefore, man is constituted a sinner.</p>
<p>When man fell and was fully corrupted, God could not ignore this matter. He had to deal with sins because He is not only a Lawmaker but also an Executor of the law. Since man sinned and violated God&rsquo;s commandment, man had a record of sin before Him. Thus, there were two major problems after man fell: first, man had a sinful life, a sinful nature within him, and second, man had a record of sin before God.</p>
<p>In both the East and the West, past and present, many sages have debated whether man&rsquo;s nature is good or evil. Some believe that man&rsquo;s nature is evil, and others believe that man&rsquo;s nature is good. There is a debate because there are indeed two elements in fallen man, a good element and an evil element. Man&rsquo;s good element comes from God&rsquo;s creation; man&rsquo;s evil element comes from Satan&rsquo;s life. Before a person is saved, he has the elements of good and evil in him even though he does not have God&rsquo;s life. Sometimes we really have good thoughts and intend to honor our parents. This is related to the element of good in us. But at other times, our heart is filled with murderous thoughts, envious hatred, and disobedience to parents. This is related to the element of evil in us. This is the reason that sages throughout time have debated about the nature of man.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s shining we know that such a debate is unnecessary, because man has both the good created life as well as the corrupt fallen life. The element within our created life is good, and the element within our fallen life is corrupt. The good element is from God&rsquo;s created life; the corrupt element is from Satan&rsquo;s corrupt life. Although man can still manifest the good element, he manifests the corrupt element much more. Therefore, as a vessel, man has been corrupted.</p>
<p>Not only is fallen man corrupt in himself, he has a record of sin before God. Man&rsquo;s sinning always has these two aspects. For example, a mother may tell her children not to play with their drinking glasses, but when she leaves them alone, they ignore her words, play with their glasses, and break them. When the mother returns, she can tell from their actions that they have violated her word. Thus, the children have a record of sin, a transgression, before her. This transgression, however, does not have anything to do with the physical being of the children. The mother may also tell her children not to drink a substance in a bottle lest they be poisoned, but when she leaves them alone, they may taste the substance out of curiosity. This transgression has a different consequence because now they have taken a poisonous substance into their body. Their drinking not only violates the mother&rsquo;s commandment, which results in a transgression outside their body, but also it has poisoned their body. If it were merely a transgression outside their body, the mother would need only to forgive them. However, since a poisonous substance has entered into their body, the problem cannot be solved by outward forgiveness alone. The mother must seek emergency medical treatment.</p>
<p>The fall of our forefathers in the garden of Eden can be likened to both examples. After man fell, he had both a record of sin before God, having a transgression outwardly, and Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature in his body inwardly.</p>
<p>As Adam&rsquo;s descendants, we all have Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature within us, whether we are Chinese or foreign, educated or illiterate, good-natured or ill-natured. Whether we believe this word or not, the facts speak for themselves. We need to consider all the instances in our lives when we acted against our inward desire and will. Often we have an inward desire to not do evil, to not fall, or to not do devious things, but at a certain point, there is a driving power within us that pushes us to do immoral things against our will. We often do many dishonorable things against our will, and even though this makes us unhappy, we have no ability to refrain from doing them. There is a power in us that takes us captive. This power is Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature. This proves that we have been corrupted inwardly, having a poisonous sinful life with its corrupting element.</p>
<p>Just as an empty vessel is designed to contain something, Adam was made to contain God. However, Satan came into man first. After this, man became complicated and corrupt. Man first acted in violation of God&rsquo;s commandment; therefore, he has a record of sin. However, man also has the activities of the devil within him. When we are careful, the devil may be constricted a little, but the devil can come out with just a little inward stirring. I once aspired to improve myself, and I had great ambitions in my childhood. As I grew, however, the more I wanted to improve, the more of a mess I became, and many devious tricks were manifested in me. I know that many people have even more tricks than I, but all these are the result of the devil coming into man and corrupting him inwardly.</p><h2 class="head2">Bringing In the Curse</h2>
<p>A fifth result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that man was not only constituted a sinner, having a record of sin before God, but he was also cursed by God. God said, &ldquo;Cursed is the ground because of you&rdquo; (Gen. 3:17). Adam was the head of the old creation, and he represented all the old creation. Therefore, Adam&rsquo;s sinning brought in a curse upon the old creation that he represented. Because one man sinned, all creation was made subject to vanity, groaning, travailing in pain, and hoping to be freed from the slavery of corruption (Rom. 5:12; 8:20-22).</p>
<p>God also said, &ldquo;Thorns and thistles will it [the ground] bring forth for you&rdquo; (Gen. 3:18). This speaks of disharmony in creation. Originally, creation was in harmony, but when Adam, the head of creation, sinned and was no longer in harmony with the Creator, all creation lost its harmony as well. This disharmony has produced the killing and the lack of peace in the universe today.</p>
<p>Not only was the ground cursed to bring forth thorns and thistles, God greatly multiplied the pain of the woman in her childbearing and made man eat bread by the sweat of his face (vv. 16-19). These are curses that man brought upon himself when he fell.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cast out of Eden</h2>
<p>Being cast out of Eden is the sixth result of man&rsquo;s first fall. Verses 23 and 24 say, &ldquo;Then Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he was taken. So He drove the man out.&rdquo; God formed man from dust and brought man into the garden of Eden so that he might contact the tree of life and be transformed into precious materials as symbolized by gold, bdellium, and precious stones (2:10-12; cf. footnote 1 on verse 12 in the Recovery Version of the Bible). Regrettably, however, man contacted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was corrupted before he contacted the tree of life. Therefore, until the corruption that man incurred could be dealt with, God could only send him forth to return to the ground from which he came. Man was from the dust of the ground, and to dust he was to return. Henceforth, in his sinful condition man could no longer enjoy the pleasures in the garden of Eden or take of the fruit of the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing In Death</h2>
<p>The seventh and final result of man&rsquo;s first fall is death. God warned Adam that in the day that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would surely die (v. 17). When Adam violated this forbidding commandment and ate the fruit of this tree, he experienced death. Death can be divided into a few steps. First, man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened. This happened when he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. At that time, his fellowship with God was cut off, and he could no longer use his spirit to contact God. Second, his body died. Genesis 5:5 says, &ldquo;All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, and he died.&rdquo; Third, there is an eternal death. Except for God&rsquo;s redemption, Adam would be cast into the lake of fire, along with all those whose names are not written in the book of life. This lake of fire is the second death (Rev. 20:14-15).</p>
<p>Romans 5:12 says, &ldquo;Just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men.&rdquo; Adam&rsquo;s sinning brought in not only sin but also death. Who would have thought that one transgression would bring in such tragic results? All the tragedies in the world of the old creation are due to that one fall of man. The result of sin is indeed dreadful!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the process and issue of man&rsquo;s first fall. Although the issue of man&rsquo;s fall was pitiful, the Bible does not stop there. When there was no way out for man and he was despondent, God came in. When God comes in, there is a way out. Because of His love for man, God prepared a way of salvation to deal with man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WAY OF SALVATION TO DEAL WITH MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking Man</h2>
<p>The first step in God&rsquo;s dealing with man&rsquo;s fall was to seek man. After the fall Adam and Eve felt ashamed and were afraid of God, and they &ldquo;hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden&rdquo; (Gen. 3:8). However, God came to seek them. After the fall, in God&rsquo;s first words to Adam, He asked, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; (v. 9). What a great gospel! After man&rsquo;s fall God&rsquo;s first words to man were the gospel: &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; When we are in sin, corruption, or death, God comes to ask, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; This shows that God is seeking man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Judging the Serpent</h2>
<p>The second step in God&rsquo;s dealing with man&rsquo;s fall was to judge the serpent by cursing him (v. 14). This curse includes two things. First, God cursed the serpent, making him to go on his stomach. This means that the realm of the serpent&rsquo;s activities would be limited; he would be allowed only to creep on the earth. According to this account, the serpent did not go on his stomach until he was cursed by God. This is symbolic and meaningful. After man fell because of Satan&rsquo;s temptation, God cursed and judged Satan, limiting the realm of his activity to the earth. Those who understand spiritual warfare know that when we fall and become earthly and worldly, we enter the realm in which Satan works. However, when our spirit is uplifted, transcendent, and in the heavenly realm, Satan has no influence over us.</p>
<p>Second, God cursed the serpent so that he would eat dust all the days of his life (v. 14). This is another limitation because it limited the type of food that the serpent could eat. First Peter 5:8 says that Satan &ldquo;walks about, seeking someone to devour.&rdquo; The kind of person who is a target for Satan&rsquo;s devouring is an earthy person. Those who are out of Adam are earthy, and such ones are the target of Satan&rsquo;s devouring (1 Cor. 15:47). After Satan was cursed, God limited him to eating dust. In terms of spiritual symbolism, when we live by the life of the old creation, that is, by our flesh and our natural life, we are earthy, and we become food for Satan to devour. But when we are spiritual and heavenly, we are delivered from the realm of Satan&rsquo;s devouring.</p>
<p>Although creeping on the earth and eating dust are limitations to Satan, they are also a dealing to man. Because man fell and became earthy, Satan is able to work in man and to devour man. However, God came to save man and to deal with man&rsquo;s fall by limiting Satan to move only on the earth and to eat only dust as his food. When a person is saved, he is delivered from the earth to the heavenlies (Eph. 1:3) and out of dust to the spirit; that is, he is delivered out of the realm of Satan. God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan is also a way of dealing with man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROMISE OF THE SEED OF THE WOMAN</h2>
<p>When God judged the serpent, He spoke a promise, saying, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (Gen. 3:15). This important verse in the Bible includes four crucial phrases: <em>I will put enmity between you and the woman; between your seed and her seed; he will bruise you on the head;</em> and <em>you will bruise him on the heel.</em> These four phrases are very significant and present contrasts. The first contrast is between <em>you</em> and <em>the woman,</em> the second is between <em>your seed</em> and <em>her seed,</em> and the third is between <em>he will bruise you on the head</em> and <em>you will bruise him on the heel.</em></p>
<p>After being damaged by the serpent, Adam and Eve saw their shame. When God came to seek them, they hated the serpent who had ensnared them, but they were also afraid that God would punish them. They thought that they would surely die after eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, they must have been in fear and trembling, awaiting God&rsquo;s punishment. This was the background of God&rsquo;s giving them the promise. When God came, He first cursed and judged the serpent, but in this judgment God brought His promise and grace to man.</p>
<p>God said to the serpent, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (v. 15). This word was pleasant to Eve&rsquo;s ear. God had charged Adam and Eve not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that they ate of it they would surely die (2:17). Because they had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge, they were deserving of death. In this state of fear, God spoke of enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman. The phrase <em>her seed,</em> &ldquo;the seed of the woman,&rdquo; conveys the light of life, the gospel of life. How could there be a seed if the woman died? For the woman to have a seed meant that the woman would not die. When Eve understood the meaning of God&rsquo;s word, she might have praised Him, saying, &ldquo;I will not die, because I will have a seed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>God also said to the serpent that the seed of the woman would bruise him on the head. By this time Eve should have been clear that although she hated the serpent, she had no way to deal with him. However, she would have a seed who would bruise the serpent on the head. The vital part of a serpent is its head. When a serpent&rsquo;s head is bruised, it is killed. Hence, Eve must have been very happy, because someone would come to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head. Nevertheless, the serpent would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman. Although this bruise would be painful, it would not be fatal. These four points speak of God&rsquo;s promise to man. This promise was revealed in God&rsquo;s word of judgment upon Satan.</p>
<p>Genesis 3:15 contains the first promise in the Bible. The content of this promise is rich and significant. It shows Satan&rsquo;s work throughout the ages among the children of God, and it shows the Lord Jesus&rsquo; annulling of Satan&rsquo;s work. This is the first promise regarding the Lord Jesus as the seed of the woman bruising the serpent&rsquo;s head. Genesis 3:15 is the first promise in the Bible that refers to the Lord Jesus and His work on the cross. Therefore, this promise occupies a crucial place in the Bible. This fact has been acknowledged by Bible expositors throughout the ages. In order to expound this promise, we need to know the record of the entire Bible, because this promise encompasses everything from Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Four Persons in the Promise</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Serpent</h2>
<p>Four persons are spoken of in the promise in Genesis 3:15. The first person in this verse, <em>you,</em> refers to Satan. Although God was talking to the serpent, Satan was in the serpent. The serpent was the incarnation of Satan. Hence, the serpent was Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Woman</h2>
<p>The second person in this verse, <em>the woman,</em> refers to a woman who has several layers of meaning. It is very clear that the woman refers to Eve. However, if we consider the entire Bible, we will realize that this woman refers to much more than just Eve. Some people say that this woman refers to Mary because the Lord Jesus was the seed of a woman and because He bruised the serpent&rsquo;s head on the cross. Hence, they say that this woman must refer also to Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus. Even though we acknowledge that this woman refers to Mary, &ldquo;the woman&rdquo; still refers to much more. This woman is a great, mysterious woman.</p>
<p>This woman includes not only Eve and Mary, because all those who have been created by God and who are of God are included in this woman. The Bible reveals that God is the unique man in the universe. He is the only man in the universe. Everyone who has been created by God and is of God, that is, all those who are redeemed by God, are the woman. This is the reason that the Old Testament refers to the children of Israel as the wife of God (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1; Hosea 2:19). They were a woman before God. Furthermore, the New Testament speaks of all the saved ones being a virgin betrothed to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). In the future the church, a composition of all the saved ones, will be the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:9).</p>
<p>These examples show that God&rsquo;s created and redeemed ones are in the position of a woman. Simply speaking, this woman is the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones throughout the ages. Therefore, <em>I will put enmity between you and the woman</em> means that there will be enmity between Satan and God&rsquo;s redeemed ones. This matter is proved by history. History reveals that Satan is at enmity with whoever turns to God and receives God&rsquo;s redemption. In the vision in Revelation 12 the serpent is called &ldquo;the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan&rdquo; (v. 9). This is the serpent in Genesis 3. This ancient serpent stood before a woman (Rev. 12:4), being at enmity with her and opposing her as her adversary.</p>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 is the woman in Genesis 3. The promise in Genesis is not fulfilled before Revelation 12. Therefore, the woman in Genesis 3 is the woman manifested in Revelation 12. This woman is not an individual woman; rather, she is a universal woman because she is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars is on her head (v. 1). This woman is a great, universal woman. Everything about her is heavenly. The sun, the moon, and the twelve stars are all heavenly. Moreover, they are light-bearers; they are bright, without any darkness. This woman is extraordinary; the light-bearers in the universe are with her and are related to her.</p>
<p>To whom does this universal woman refer? There are only two places in the Bible that mention the sun, the moon, and twelve stars together. One place is Revelation 12, and the other is Genesis 37. We must use Genesis 37 to interpret the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars in Revelation 12. According to Genesis 37:9, Joseph had a dream about the sun, the moon, and eleven stars. These light-bearers represent the entire household of Israel that had been redeemed by God. From the context we can clearly see that the sun refers to Jacob, Joseph&rsquo;s father; the moon refers to Joseph&rsquo;s mother; and eleven of the twelve stars refer to Joseph&rsquo;s brothers. There are twelve stars including Joseph. This was Jacob&rsquo;s entire household. The principle of the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars being together refers to the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones. Hence, this universal woman, who is clothed with the sun, who has the moon underneath her feet, and who has a crown of twelve stars on her head, refers to the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 the holy city, New Jerusalem, is referred to as a bride adorned for her husband, coming down out of heaven from God (v. 2). This city includes all those who have been saved throughout time. Collectively, these saved persons are a woman before God. This woman is heavenly, not earthly, and she is bright, not dark. Undoubtedly, the woman in chapter 12 is the predecessor of the bride in chapter 21. When the days are fulfilled, the woman in chapter 12 will be manifested as the bride in chapter 21. Hence, the universal woman in chapter 12 refers to the totality of those who have been redeemed by God throughout the ages.</p>
<p>The universal woman in chapter 12 is clothed with light-bearers. The sun is for the day, and the moon and the stars are for the night. According to the Bible, day and night symbolize the age of the New Testament and the age of the Old Testament, respectively. When Christ came to the earth, He was manifested as the rising sun (Luke 1:78). Therefore, the birth of the Lord Jesus was the coming of the day and marked the beginning of the New Testament age. Since the New Testament is the age of the day, the Old Testament should be the age of the night. Hence, the sun with which the woman is clothed refers to all those who are redeemed in the New Testament age. The moon underneath her feet and the twelve stars on her head refer to the redeemed ones in the Old Testament age.</p>
<p>The redeemed ones in the Old Testament are divided into two categories. One category is stars, which are scattered, and the other category is the moon, which is collective. If we consider the Old Testament, we will realize that this is exactly the case. The first period of the Old Testament was the period of the patriarchs, from Abraham to Joseph, who were stars. Twelve is the number of completeness. In the eyes of God, the patriarchs were stars in a dark night, drawing near to God. Therefore, they are in the front and upon the head. After the time of the patriarchs, the nation of Israel was formed. This nation is a collective unit; hence, it is represented by the moon.</p>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 has the stars on her head and the moon underneath her feet. Putting something on the head is to exalt it, but putting something underneath the feet is to lower it. The patriarchs, represented by the twelve stars, were living in the principle of grace. They were in the Old Testament age, but they lived in the grace of God, taking grace as their principle of living before God. The principle of grace is the highest principle. This is the reason that the patriarchs are exalted as stars. The New Testament age is also altogether in the principle of grace, which is indicated by the sun. Therefore, the woman is clothed with the sun.</p>
<p>The children of Israel became a collective unit from the time that the law was given at Mount Sinai. When the law was given, the children of Israel were no longer under grace but under the law (Exo. 19&mdash;20). The woman in Revelation 12 has the moon underneath her feet, signifying that the law should not be exalted. The twelve stars refer to the first group of redeemed people, the patriarchs, who lived under grace. The sun refers to the redeemed in the New Testament, who constitute the majority of this woman. Based on this light, we can interpret the vision in Revelation 12. The woman in this vision is the woman in God&rsquo;s promise in Genesis 3:15, and Satan is at enmity with her.</p><h2 class="head3">The Seed of the Serpent</h2>
<p>The third person spoken of in 3:15, <em>your seed,</em> refers to the seed of the serpent, the seed of Satan. In Matthew 3:7 John the Baptist said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?&rdquo; <em>Offspring of vipers</em> refers to the seed of vipers. The Lord Jesus said to the Jews, &ldquo;You are of your father the devil&rdquo; (John 8:44). The apostle John said, &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil&rdquo; (1 John 3:8). These verses reveal that those who offend God, reject Him, and commit sins are full of the nature and wickedness of the devil. As such, they are the seed of the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>In the broadest sense, the fourth person in Genesis 3:15, <em>her seed,</em> the seed of the woman, refers to a group of strong overcomers. Although not all who have been redeemed and saved by grace are strong, there is a group who are not only saved but also strong; they are able to stand on God&rsquo;s side to deal with His enemy. The overcomers throughout the ages, such as Abel, Abraham, David, Daniel, and Isaiah, are faithful to God. They are not only God&rsquo;s redeemed but also the strong ones among God&rsquo;s people. They are the seed of the woman.</p>
<p>Moreover, the woman refers to the man-child in Revelation 12:5, which is the group of overcomers who are produced in the church. Revelation 12 presents a principle: the universal woman gives birth to a man-child, not a woman-child. This is significant. All God&rsquo;s people are female, but she gives birth to a man-child. The man-child symbolizes the strong overcomers. Before the man-child is born, he is inside the woman and is part of the woman. The man-child refers to those who are strong to overcome the world, Satan, and lusts and who are able to testify for God among His people. In the eyes of God, these ones are the seed of the woman. On the one hand, they are the seed of the woman; on the other hand, they are part of the woman.</p>
<p>The seed of the woman refers also to the Lord Jesus. Isaiah prophesied, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (Isa. 7:14), referring to the Lord Jesus. He is the seed of the woman, and He also bruised the serpent&rsquo;s head on the cross. Hence, the Lord Jesus is the true overcomer. He is the true seed of the woman.</p>
<p>The seed of the woman thus refers to the overcomers of God, who stand on God&rsquo;s side, who are strong and powerful, and who stand for God among His redeemed people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Four Crucial Points in the Promise</h2>
<h2 class="head3">There Being Enmity between the Serpent<br />
and the Woman</h2>
<p>Having identified the four persons referred to in the promise, we can understand the significance of Genesis 3:15 as God&rsquo;s first promise in the Bible. The first crucial point of the promise is that there would be &ldquo;enmity between you and the woman.&rdquo; <em>You</em> refers to the serpent who tempted, damaged, and deceived man. The serpent was the incarnation of Satan; hence, <em>you</em> refers to Satan. There will be enmity between Satan and the woman. This is the first aspect of the significance of God&rsquo;s promise. Spiritually speaking, this aspect refers to the enmity between Satan and those who have been redeemed by God throughout the ages.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being Enmity<br />
between the Seed of the Serpent<br />
and the Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>The second crucial point is that there would be enmity &ldquo;between your seed and her seed.&rdquo; Satan has a seed, which is great in number. There are two groups of people on the earth: one group is the seed of the devil, and the other is the seed of the woman. There is enmity between them.</p>
<p>There are also two aspects to this crucial point. First, throughout the ages all those who have followed Satan and are of Satan oppose and have had enmity toward the overcomers, who are of God. Those who do evil always have enmity against the overcomers of God, who rise up to testify for God. This enmity began in Genesis 4. Cain is the first type of the seed of Satan, because the New Testament clearly tells us that Cain was of the evil one (1 John 3:12). In contrast, Abel is the first type of the seed of the woman. Abel was not only the seed of the woman but in the principle of a man. He was a top one, a strong one, among the redeemed ones.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, starting with Abel, numerous people not only were redeemed to become part of the woman, but they also were part of the overcoming man-child. They stood firm in exceedingly great trials and temptations. They did not love their soul-life even unto death (Rev. 12:11). They did not care about persecution or being killed. They testified for God and stood on God&rsquo;s side, putting the enemy to shame. They were overcomers. Today we are saved, and we should also ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I a weak one in the woman or part of the man-child who stands in a strong way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, the enmity &ldquo;between your seed and her seed&rdquo; applies to the Lord Jesus even more. As soon as He was born, those who were of the devil wanted to kill Him (Matt. 2:13-16); eventually, they crucified the Lord on the cross (27:20-26).</p><h2 class="head3">The Seed of the Woman<br />
Bruising the Serpent on the Head</h2>
<p>The third crucial point is that the seed of the woman would &ldquo;bruise you on the head.&rdquo; <em>You</em> here refers to Satan. This means that the seed of the woman would bruise Satan on his head. This particularly applies to the Lord Jesus. Through His death on the cross, the Lord destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), putting him to death.</p>
<p>In the promise of God in Genesis 3:15, the central point is the seed of the woman bruising the serpent on his head. This refers to Christ coming to destroy Satan. This is the greatest point in God&rsquo;s judgment upon the serpent, Satan. God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan speaks of Christ becoming a man to destroy Satan and deliver man from Satan. Therefore, this is the most crucial and central promise in the Bible. This is God&rsquo;s first promise concerning Christ and His salvation, and this is also the first prophecy in plain words in the Bible concerning the Lord Jesus and His work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Serpent Bruising<br />
the Seed of the Woman on the Heel</h2>
<p>The fourth crucial point is that the serpent would &ldquo;bruise him on the heel.&rdquo; <em>Him</em> refers to the seed of the woman. This means that Satan will bruise the heel of the woman&rsquo;s seed. In the fulfillment of the type <em>him</em> refers to the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil on the cross, the devil bruised the heel of the Lord. This bruise on the heel occurred when Christ was wounded by His feet being nailed to the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fulfillment of the Promise</h2>
<p>All the points in this promise are being and will be fulfilled throughout the ages gradually. First, this promise is fulfilled in all those who are of God. Indeed, since the time of this promise, there has been enmity between Satan and those who are of God. This will continue until the Lord comes back (Rev. 12:4, 13-17). Even after the millennial kingdom, Satan will have one last struggle in this matter (20:7-10).</p>
<p>Second, this promise is fulfilled in the overcomers. Starting with Abel, there has been enmity between all those who follow Satan and the strong ones among those who are of God, and it will continue until the end of the age at the rapture of the overcomers (12:5).</p>
<p>Third, this promise was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus. As soon as the Lord Jesus was born, Herod and others who were of Satan had enmity against Him and wanted to kill Him (Matt. 2:13-16). The four Gospels also show that when the Lord Jesus was walking on the earth, those who were of Satan, whether Jews or Gentiles, also had enmity against Him. They persecuted and inflicted harm on Him until they eventually killed Him.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion fulfilled the second half of this promise. On the one hand, through His death He destroyed Satan, bruising the &ldquo;serpent&rdquo; on his head and putting him to death (Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8). On the other hand, Satan also bruised the Lord Jesus on the cross, causing Him to suffer the pangs of death (Psa. 22:12-17). All these were related to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking when He judged the serpent was not only a promise but also a prophecy. Although there are not many words in this promise, its contents are very broad because it speaks of Satan&rsquo;s work throughout the ages, of the enmity between those who follow Satan and those who testify for God, of God&rsquo;s dealing with Satan, and of the Lord Jesus becoming flesh to accomplish His work on the cross. Everything mentioned in the Bible regarding the struggle between God and Satan, from Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation, is related to this promise.</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve heard God&rsquo;s promise, they must have felt much joy, because God&rsquo;s word caused them to realize that God would deal with the serpent, whom they feared and hated, by putting him to death. Therefore, when Adam and Eve heard this word, they had a living hope. When they realized that they had sinned and thought that they would surely die, they were in fear and trembling, awaiting their death. Under these circumstances, however, they heard that Eve would give birth to a seed and that this seed would bruise and put to death the serpent who had damaged them. What a joyful gospel this was to them! They had a living hope. This is God&rsquo;s first promise to man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider God&rsquo;s way of salvation to deal with man&rsquo;s first fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUBDUING MAN WITH SUFFERING</h2>
<p>God dealt with man&rsquo;s first fall by seeking man, by judging the serpent, and by giving a promise to man. He also dealt with man&rsquo;s fall by subduing man through suffering. After judging the serpent and giving a promise in His word of judgment, God said to the woman, &ldquo;I will greatly multiply / Your pain in your childbearing; / In pain you will bring forth children&rdquo; (Gen. 3:16). God&rsquo;s judgment on the woman did not include death or destruction; it involved pain, suffering. This word is still being fulfilled in mankind. Women go through a painful process in childbearing, including pregnancy, delivery, and raising children. This process was arranged by God. However, women also are saved through childbearing, &ldquo;if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:15).</p>
<p>God had another special arrangement for the woman: &ldquo;Your desire will be to your husband, / And he will rule over you&rdquo; (Gen. 3:16). This means that, on one hand, the woman must focus her heart on her husband, and on the other hand, she must be under the rule of her husband. With her heart attached to her husband and her person ruled by her husband, a woman is limited in other inclinations and cannot readily assume the headship, thus saving her from much trouble. If a woman is willing to accept God&rsquo;s arrangement to whole-heartedly love her husband and absolutely submit to the authority of her husband, this arrangement will become a salvation and protection (1 Tim. 2:11-12).</p>
<p>God gave the man a different kind of suffering. A man must toil all the days of his life; that is, by the sweat of his face will he eat bread (Gen. 3:17-19). Before the fall it was easy to work the ground, but after the fall it was no longer easy to work the ground, because it gave forth thorns and thistles. Although most of us are not farmers, we still need to toil, labor, and sweat until we return to the ground. Returning to the ground is the consequence of sin in man&rsquo;s body. Hence, God uses suffering to deal with both the man and the woman.</p>
<p>No one thinks that suffering is good, and no one wants to suffer. Although suffering is not a good thing, it is appointed by God, just as medication is prescribed by a doctor for his patients, even though it may be bitter. God&rsquo;s intention in assigning sufferings to us is to subdue us and save us. After the fall it is good to have sufferings because it is dangerous to be at ease. A person who is at ease commits more sins. If a person works hard every day, he will have no time to sin. The more a person suffers, the less he commits sins, but the more a person is at ease, the more he commits sins.</p>
<p>There are three things that are both good and bad for man: suffering, sleep, and death. No matter how bad a person is, it is unlikely that he will be bad for one hundred and twenty years, for he may die by the age of eighty. Man has this &ldquo;greater&rdquo; death and also a &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; death, which is sleep. If fallen mankind lived an easy life without sleeping or dying, eventually the people in the world would all be old and crafty. No matter how evil a person is, he cannot escape death. There are many evil people in the world today, but we do not fear their evil, because one day they will die. Committing evil shortens a person&rsquo;s life. The more a person commits sin and does evil, the sooner he will die. Those who sin more will die sooner.</p>
<p>It is good that man must die. It would be terrible if there were no death. Suffering, sleep, and death are God&rsquo;s protection. Without death this world would be much more corrupt. The same can be said about suffering. A man who labors and toils to take care of his family and to fulfill his duties at work and does not wander around will avoid many opportunities to sin. If he lives an easy life, however, he will commit many sins and do many evil things. He also needs to stop and sleep every day. Those who like to play mah-jongg are the least willing to sleep. Eventually, however, everyone has to sleep due to fatigue. Sleep reduces the time for playing mah-jongg. The world today is full of evil things. Without suffering, sleep, and death, it is difficult to say what this generation would become. Suffering is a remedy, protection, and salvation.</p>
<p>After World War II many women in Europe and America have not wanted to have children, because they want to enjoy an easier life. This is an offense to God. Women who do not want to have children tend to live dissolutely. One of the best ways to deal with a dissolute woman is for her to have three children; then she will become sober. There was once a woman who was so dissolute that her parents and teachers did not know what to do with her; eventually, however, she was subdued by her two children.</p>
<p>We should not think that God&rsquo;s arrangement is wrong. It is God&rsquo;s arrangement for women to raise a family and for men to sweat in making a living. This arrangement enables human beings to maintain a normal living and prevents fallen people from becoming worse. If suffering does not subdue someone, God will make him sleep. This is as if God were saying, &ldquo;Take a break! You have sinned enough.&rdquo; If this &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; death cannot subdue him, he will still die one day. No matter how much evil a person commits, he will eventually die. This is what it means to be subdued through suffering. Because of suffering, sleep, and death, there is a continuing human history. Without suffering, sleep, and death, fallen mankind would be out of control. Subduing man through suffering is the way to deal with man&rsquo;s fall in order to save and preserve man. God does not intend to destroy man; rather, He wants to preserve man, and He wants to redeem man.</p><h2 class="head2">The Anticipated Redemption</h2>
<p>Even though God came to seek man, to judge the serpent, to give a promise to man, and to subdue man through suffering, Adam and Eve were still sinful and naked. Hence, God provided an anticipated redemption by probably slaughtering a lamb as a sacrifice for them (v. 21). The sacrifice was innocent and sinless, but it was killed as a substitute for the sake of redemption. The meaning of sacrifice is substitution. Adam and Eve might have understood that they were supposed to die because of their sin, but God killed a sacrifice, shedding its blood on their behalf. Hence, Adam and Eve did not have to die. When they saw the substitutionary sacrifice, they surely must have had a sense of peace. God&rsquo;s sacrifice in the garden was an indication that Christ the Lamb, whom God prepared for man, would be killed in order to accomplish redemption for man.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve did not die, but they were still naked. Hence, God made coats of skin and clothed them (v. 21). The coats of skin were to cover their shame. When Adam and Eve first saw their shame, &ldquo;they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves&rdquo; (v. 7). This means that they were trying to be saved by their own conduct and merit. They had offended God, but they tried to have some accomplishment and merit, covering and hiding their transgressions with their conduct. God&rsquo;s way of salvation, however, is not for man to do something. Rather, God killed a sacrifice and used the skin of the sacrifice to cover their shame.</p>
<p>When Adam was clothed with the skin of the lamb, he was identified with the lamb. Adam was the lamb, and the lamb became Adam. The lamb and Adam were identified as one. This symbolizes Christ as the Lamb of God shedding His blood to redeem us from our sins. It also symbolizes God giving Christ to us as our righteousness. For this reason, the Bible says that all those who are saved are clothed with Christ; that is, they have put on Christ (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27). Adam&rsquo;s putting on the coat of skin signifies that those who have Christ have put on Christ and are identified with Christ the Lamb as one.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the Lamb is based on identification. If we are not identified with Christ, His blood will have nothing to do with us. If Adam had not been identified with the lamb, the efficacy of its blood in type would not have been applied to him. The shed blood dealt with Adam&rsquo;s sins before God, but he still needed to put on the coat of skin so that he would not be naked. It was not until Adam put on the coat of skin and was identified with the lamb that the efficacy of the blood shed in the lamb&rsquo;s substitutionary death was applied to Adam. The giving of this anticipated redemption caused Adam to have peace. Of course, this was a type of the coming redemption; it was an anticipated redemption. The accomplishment of this redemption did not occur until after Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. Before Christ came, God allowed man to live before God under this anticipated redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Closing the Way to the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Although God provided man with an anticipated redemption, redemption had not yet been accomplished. Therefore, God closed the way to the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). The tree of life signifies God. God created man as a vessel for Himself. His original intention was for man to choose the tree of life in order to contain Him. However, because God is great and wise, He will not force man to receive Him. Hence, He placed the man whom He created in front of Himself as the tree of life, giving man the freedom to choose. If man loved and chose Him, God would enter into man. Regrettably, Satan, God&rsquo;s adversary, came to tempt man first. God gave man the freedom to choose in order to express His greatness and wisdom. In order to gain man for himself, however, Satan, the evil one, came in to tempt and deceive man to keep man from freely choosing God. As a result, Satan&rsquo;s evil life entered into man as an empty vessel, and man became impure, complicated, and corrupt.</p>
<p>It was not possible for man, as a corrupted vessel, to contain God. Before dealing with the corruption within man, God forbade man to touch the tree of life, drove man away from the tree of life, and closed the way to the tree of life. The tree of life denotes God. Hence, to close the way to the tree of life is to close the way to contact God. Man is a vessel to contain God, but because evil things entered into him, God forbade man to receive Him, by closing the way for man to draw near to Him.</p>
<p>God closed the way to the tree of life not only because man was corrupt inwardly but also because man had a record of sin before God. The tree of life, which the created man was placed in front of, signifies God. However, when man sinned before God, he lost the right to contact God as the tree of life. For this reason, God closed the way that led to the tree of life.</p>
<p>Before man fell, there was nothing between man and God. But after man fell, God drove man away from the tree of life. God closed the way to the tree of life by placing cherubim to guard the way to the tree of life (v. 24). From this point forward, man had to be approved by the cherubim in order to contact the tree of life. The Bible reveals that the glory of God rests with the cherubim (Ezek. 9:3). The cherubim guard the glory of God. Hence, cherubim represent the glory of God. In the Holy of Holies the expiation cover upon the Ark was guarded by the cherubim of glory (Heb. 9:5). Therefore, the cherubim&rsquo;s closing the way to the tree of life means that God&rsquo;s glory closed the way to the tree of life, and the cherubim&rsquo;s forbidding man to contact the tree of life means that the glory of God prevented man from contacting the tree of life.</p>
<p>Why did the glory of God forbid man to contact the tree of life? Romans 3:23 says, &ldquo;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&rdquo; This means that after sinning, man was no longer up to the standard of the glory of God; he could not match the glory of God. For example, when I invite guests for a meal, my house is cleaned, and my children are dressed properly. If one of my children comes in covered with mud after my guests arrive, and we are ready to eat, I cannot allow him to eat at the table, because his condition does not match the condition of the table. The condition of the table is one of glory, but his condition falls short of this glory. Likewise, the life of God is glorious. The man whom God created for His glorious life matched the glory of God originally. But when man fell, he fell short of the glory of God and no longer matched the glory of God. Hence, the glory of God guards the way to the tree of life, forbidding man to come close.</p>
<p>The second item that guarded the way to the tree of life was a flame (Gen. 3:24). In the Bible the flame of fire refers to the holiness of God, and fire is often used to destroy that which does not match the holiness of God. For example, in Leviticus 10 Nadab and Abihu presented strange fire before Jehovah, and fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them (vv. 1-2). Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;Our God is also a consuming fire&rdquo; (Heb. 12:29; Deut. 4:24). God&rsquo;s holiness prevents filthy man from approaching Him and receiving His life. This is the significance of the flame guarding the way to the tree of life.</p>
<p>The third item that guarded the way to the tree of life was a sword (Gen. 3:24). The slaying sword indicates the righteousness of God. God&rsquo;s slaying of a sinful man is according to His righteousness. God is righteous, so He will by no means clear the guilty. He must mete out punishment, and this punishment is death. The sword is for putting man to death, and death is the result of sin. Sinful man would not have to die if God&rsquo;s righteousness did not condemn him. Hence, man has to die not only because of his sin but also because of God&rsquo;s righteousness. After man sins, God&rsquo;s righteousness comes in to convict man with death. Therefore, the sword&rsquo;s guarding of the tree of life means that God&rsquo;s righteousness does not allow sinful man to contact the tree of life.</p>
<p>These three items&mdash;the cherubim, the flame, and the sword&mdash;indicate that the tree of life is surrounded by God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. When the children of Israel came to Mount Sinai, they had a heart to draw near to God. However, the condition of Mount Sinai was terrifying. The cloud, representing God&rsquo;s glory (Exo. 24:15-17), the fire, representing God&rsquo;s holiness (19:18, 22-23), and the righteous law, representing God&rsquo;s righteousness (20:1-17), prevented them from drawing near to God. This picture at Mount Sinai reflects the glorious cherubim and the flaming sword guarding the way to the tree of life. The children of Israel wanted to draw near to God, that is, to contact Him as the tree of life, but God was surrounded by His glory, holiness, and righteousness, which prevented them from drawing near. Because man fell, God closed the way for man to contact the tree of life until the redemption of Christ was accomplished.</p>
<p>The tabernacle is another example. Outside the tabernacle was the outer court; within the tabernacle were the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, where God was. Separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies was a veil embroidered with cherubim, which represent the glory of God (26:31-33). In the Holy of Holies was the Ark, and inside the Ark were the tablets of the covenant, upon which the law was written (40:20-21; Heb. 9:3-4). The law represents the righteousness of God. Furthermore, within the tabernacle there was a consuming fire, which represents the holiness of God (Lev. 10:1-3). These three items in the tabernacle&mdash;God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness&mdash;prevented sinful man from contacting God. Hence, God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness closed the way to contacting God.</p>
<p>Since the time of Genesis 3:24 man in his sinful condition could not draw near to God. The way to the tree of life was closed until the Lord Jesus died on the cross. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, the veil in the temple was split (Mark 15:37-38), meaning that the closed way was opened. Therefore, Hebrews 10:19-20 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus shed His blood for us, initiating a new and living way for us to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God directly. The way to the tree of life was closed until the Lord Jesus died on the cross.</p>
<p>The death of the Lord Jesus on the cross took care of the glory of God, satisfied the holiness of God, and fulfilled the righteousness of God. On the cross, the Lord Jesus met the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. As a result, God opened the way to the tree of life. Based on the work of the crucified and resurrected Lord, every sinner can now come to God, and God must accept him. Man can now draw near to God and contact God to touch the life of God (James 4:8; Heb. 4:16; 10:19, 22).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SECOND FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND, CAUSE, PROCESS,<br />
AND RESULT OF THE SECOND FALL</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we considered various details of the first fall of man and God&rsquo;s corresponding way of salvation. In this chapter we will consider the second fall of man. The fall of man involved more than one step. When a person falls, it usually involves more than one step. The first step of a fall must be avoided because it is rare for a fall to involve only one step. Adam&rsquo;s fall was like falling down a set of stairs. According to the record in Genesis, there are four steps to man&rsquo;s fall. By the fourth fall, man had fallen to the uttermost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND OF MAN&rsquo;S SECOND FALL</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second fall involved Cain. The first involved Adam, but the second involved Cain. Adam and Eve were Cain&rsquo;s parents. When Adam and Eve fell, they waited in fear and trembling for God&rsquo;s judgment and their death, but God came and promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent on the head (Gen. 3:15). God promised that a seed of the woman would deal with her enemy. When Eve gave birth to a son, she thought that she had acquired the God-promised seed and named him Cain, which in Hebrew means &ldquo;acquired.&rdquo; Adam&rsquo;s hope and Eve&rsquo;s hope were in Cain; they thought that he was the promised seed of the woman. However, eventually Adam and Eve realized that Cain was not the object of their hope. He must have caused them much trouble, because they showed their discouragement and disappointment when they begot a second son and named him Abel, which means &ldquo;vanity.&rdquo; Vanity may be likened to vanishing vapor.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve were once full of hope, but their attitude changed, and they felt a sense of vanity. They hoped that the seed of the woman would save them, but Cain was not this seed. They were disappointed with Cain. Hence, when they begot Abel, they also had no hope in Abel. Nevertheless, God was pleased with Abel. This is wonderful. God does not value what man values; He values what man does not value. In other words, God does not want what man wants; He wants what man does not want.</p>
<p>There is a principle in the Bible: God does not want the first but the second. Cain was born first, and Abel was born second. Abel was the second. God does not want the first; He wants the second. This principle also applies to Abraham&rsquo;s sons, Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was the first, but Isaac was the second (21:9-13). It also applies to Isaac&rsquo;s sons: Esau and Jacob. Esau was the first, but Jacob was the second. God did not want Esau; instead, He wanted Jacob (25:22-26; Rom. 9:12-13). In Exodus God also did not want the firstborn of the Egyptians (11:5). In the New Testament, in Luke 15, the older son was well behaved, but he did not have the enjoyment of his father&rsquo;s riches. Instead, the younger son, who left his father, enjoyed all his father&rsquo;s riches (vv. 11-32). When I was young, I was indignant after reading this portion of the Bible. I asked myself whether all firstborns were bad and whether all who were born second were good. Slowly, I came to understand the meaning of this principle. In the Bible the firstborn always signifies Adam, but the second signifies Christ. Adam is the first man, but Christ is the second man (1 Cor. 15:45-47). This means that all those who are &ldquo;first,&rdquo; who are in Adam, are rejected by God. God accepts only the &ldquo;second,&rdquo; those who are in Christ.</p>
<p>Before Cain fell, Adam was full of hope for Cain. Adam&rsquo;s disappointment was expressed in the name Abel. What man hoped in was the opposite of what God wanted. This reveals that everything depends on God, not on man. Everything is with God, not with man. When things depend on man, man fails and falls, but when things depend on God, man is accepted by God and does not fall.</p>
<p>The background of man&rsquo;s second fall is that man had already fallen, man had God&rsquo;s promise to save, and man had God&rsquo;s way of salvation. Therefore, man should have been saved by God. Regrettably, man still fell.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cause of Man&rsquo;s Second Fall</h2>
<p>There were two causes of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man&rsquo;s Being Gained by Satan</h2>
<p>The cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was that man was tempted by the serpent. The cause of man&rsquo;s second fall was that he was gained by Satan. Being gained by Satan is very close to being tempted by the serpent, but there is a distinction. In Genesis 3 Satan hid in a serpent and tempted man to fall; Satan was outside of man. In chapter 4 Satan was no longer outside of man; he was within man. Therefore, even though Satan was not mentioned, he was fully involved in man&rsquo;s second fall, for he was hidden inside Cain. The New Testament says, &ldquo;Cain was of the evil one&rdquo; (1 John 3:12). This indicates that Cain was of the devil. In man&rsquo;s first fall Satan tempted man from without, but by the time of man&rsquo;s second fall Satan was hidden in man. Man had only to be slightly careless and act on his own in order to be gained by Satan.</p>
<p>Christians are often afraid of being tempted by the devil to sin. However, Satan is mixed with our fallen nature; he does not need to tempt us. Whenever we act on our own instead of rejecting ourselves, we are being gained by Satan. Because Satan was not in our forefathers before the first fall, there was a need to tempt them from without. After Adam fell, however, Satan was mixed with man&rsquo;s fallen nature and no longer needed to tempt man. If man does not deny himself and instead relies on himself, he will follow Satan and be gained by Satan.</p><h2 class="head3">Man&rsquo;s Following His Own Will</h2>
<p>The second cause of man&rsquo;s second fall was that he followed his own will. After Adam and Eve fell, God revealed His way of salvation to man; hence, man should have communed with God according to His way of salvation. However, Cain rejected God&rsquo;s way of salvation, set aside God&rsquo;s will, and served God according to his own will. Thus, man fell once more.</p>
<p>The second cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was that he assumed the headship. The second cause of man&rsquo;s second fall was that he followed his own will. Assuming the headship is very close to following one&rsquo;s own will. For man to assume the headship is for him to set God aside; for man to follow his own will is for him to set God&rsquo;s will aside. When man sets God aside, man comes forth, and when man sets God&rsquo;s will aside, man&rsquo;s will comes forth.</p>
<p>Man fell when he followed his own will, because Satan was in man, mixed with man&rsquo;s fallen will. The element of Satan was one with man&rsquo;s fallen will. Therefore, for man to follow his own will was for him to follow Satan and to be gained by Satan. For this reason, the Lord Jesus spoke of our need to deny ourselves (Matt. 16:23-24). As soon as we follow our own will, we are following Satan. As fallen men, we do not need to be tempted by Satan in order to fall. As soon as we follow our own fallen will, we will fall further.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Process of Man&rsquo;s Second Fall</h2>
<p>We will now consider the process of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Presenting an Offering to God<br />
according to the Human Will&mdash;<br />
Serving God according to a Religion<br />
Based on the Human Will</h2>
<p>First, Cain&rsquo;s offering to God was according to his own will. He was serving God according to a religion based on the human will. &ldquo;In the course of time Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground. And Abel also brought an offering, from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and for his offering. But for Cain and for his offering He had no regard&rdquo; (Gen. 4:3-5). Both Cain and Abel brought an offering to God, but Cain&rsquo;s offering was according to his own will, and Abel&rsquo;s offering was according to God&rsquo;s will. Abel offered a sacrifice according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation, but Cain&rsquo;s service and offering were altogether according to his own view, not according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation.</p>
<p>The fruit of the ground is fruits and vegetables, not meat. According to typology, vegetables refer to human works, and meat refers to Christ&rsquo;s redemption. After man sinned, he could be accepted by God only through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, not through his own works. It was not until man was redeemed by Christ that man could walk in the good works that God had prepared beforehand (Eph. 2:10) as sacrifices that are well pleasing to God (Heb. 13:16). Therefore, in the Old Testament the children of Israel first had to be redeemed by the blood of the passover lamb (Exo. 12:1-30) before they could offer up the fruit of the land (23:19; Lev. 2). Today, anyone who has not been redeemed by Christ but wants to serve and please God with his deeds, like Cain, will not be regarded by God.</p>
<p>Cain&rsquo;s way of offering reveals that he had no consciousness of sin. He did not feel sinful, even though he was sinful before God; rather, he felt that he had something to offer to God. Thus, he offered up the fruit of his labor in order to please God. Such an offering blasphemes God. When a sinner comes before God, he should, like the tax collector in Luke 18 who went up to the temple to pray (v. 13), sense his sins and shortcomings and seek God&rsquo;s mercy so that God can look upon him. He is blaspheming God if, without any consciousness of sin, he proudly presents his works and deeds to God for acceptance. No wonder Cain was rejected by God. Such behavior not only overlooks but also tramples upon God&rsquo;s righteousness. God is righteous. His righteousness cannot allow Him to look upon a sinner who does not sense his sinfulness. Many people, however, are like Cain. They overlook their sins while wanting to please God with their works. As a result, they trample on God&rsquo;s righteousness and are rejected by Him. The Pharisee who went up to the temple to pray in Luke 18 is an example of such a one. He trusted in his righteousness, despised the others, and boasted to God (vv. 9-12). Everyone in Christianity who does not follow God&rsquo;s revelation but instead follows his own will, the human view, and who serves God in the current of the world is imitating Cain; this is to go in the way of Cain (Jude 11).</p>
<p>Cain&rsquo;s service was his religion. This religion was bloodless; it desired to serve God without the shedding of the blood of the sin offering. If man had not fallen or become sinful, he would have had no need for the blood of a sin offering. But because man sinned and is sinful, he needs the blood of the sin offering. Without the shedding of the blood of the sin offering to redeem him, man&rsquo;s sins cannot be forgiven (Heb. 9:22). If man&rsquo;s sins are not forgiven, how can he serve a righteous, holy, and sin-abhorring God? How can he be accepted by such a God? Many people today are like Cain. They serve God according to a bloodless religion. They are sinful, but they do not have the redeeming blood. They want to serve God, but they do not and cannot deal with the sins that God abhors. As a result, they serve God, but they are not accepted by Him.</p>
<p>The religion of Cain is a bloodless religion, and it is also a religion of &ldquo;works&rdquo; (Rom. 3:27). Cain offered up the fruit of the ground, which he obtained by his sweat and toil. He wanted to please God with his deeds. But how can a person who is damaged and defiled by sin have any works that are clean and acceptable to God? How can any of his deeds earn merit before God or redeem him from his sins? Nevertheless, many people are like Cain, depending on their deeds and works to serve God and to be accepted by Him. God will not regard this kind of bloodless service based on works.</p>
<p>Although God instituted a way of salvation for man to draw near to Him, to serve Him, and to be accepted by Him, Satan caused man to serve God according to his own view, not according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation. God created man, but Satan caused man to sin and fall. Then God instituted a way of salvation to rescue man, but Satan caused man to reject God&rsquo;s way of salvation. Because man did not need to sin again in order to fall, Satan did not need to cause Cain to sin; he needed only to prevent Cain from accepting God&rsquo;s way of salvation. This was sufficient to keep Cain in the fall. Satan is so insidious that he does not need to tempt man to sin; he can keep man by causing man to serve God according to his human will. As long as he prevents man from following God&rsquo;s revelation and from accepting God&rsquo;s way of salvation, he can keep man in his fallen condition.</p>
<p>We should not think that only sinning can cause a man to fall but that serving God cannot. Serving God, just like sinning, can cause man to fall if it is done according to man&rsquo;s will. Cain fell because he served God according to his human will. Therefore, it is not a matter of serving God but of following God&rsquo;s will; it is a matter of giving ground to the human will rather than to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In man&rsquo;s first fall, man assumed the headship, had the ground, and set God aside. In man&rsquo;s second fall, man&rsquo;s will had the ground, not God&rsquo;s will. According to God&rsquo;s revelation, man cannot serve God according to his own will. If he tries to serve God according to his own will, he will encounter problems. Formerly, we did not serve God but loved the world and lusted after sin. Although it is commendable that we no longer love the world or lust after sin and instead desire to serve God, it is not easy for us to serve God, because we are required to serve God according His will, not according to our own will. This is a great problem.</p>
<p>If we are to serve God, our own will must be dealt with. Whether Satan can gain us does not depend on whether we sin but on whether we live according to our will or according to God&rsquo;s will. As long as we are according to our will, we are living in Satan&rsquo;s hand. Many Christians serve God, but I am afraid that many of them are in Satan&rsquo;s hand because they serve according to their own will. This is a terrible thing.</p><h2 class="head3">Becoming Very Angry</h2>
<p>Second, man became angry. When God had no regard for Cain&rsquo;s offering, &ldquo;Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell&rdquo; (Gen. 4:5). Those who serve God according to their own will eventually become angry. When anger is kindled in a person, this is an indication that he is serving God according to his own will. Like Cain, it is easy for such a person to become angry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Slaying His Brother</h2>
<p>Third, Cain slew his brother. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.&rdquo; Cain initially served God, then became angry, and eventually committed murder.</p>
<p>We should not think that those who serve God would not murder others. The Lord Jesus told the disciples, &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God&rdquo; (John 16:2). Serving God or sinning is not the problem. The problem is whether we serve according to God&rsquo;s will or according to our human will, that is, whether God&rsquo;s will has the ground or our human will has the ground. Our human will should have no ground in anything. Just as man is capable of sinning according to his own will, he is also capable of serving God according to his own will. On the surface it seems as though man is serving God, but the result is that he becomes angry and kills others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Lying and Being Arrogant<br />
toward God</h2>
<p>Fourth, man lied and was arrogant toward God. &ldquo;Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; (Gen. 4:9). Cain slew his brother, but he lied to God when God asked concerning Abel. Cain was arrogant when he spoke to God. That a creature dared to speak in such a way to his Creator shows how fallen man had become. After man fell in Genesis 3, he was afraid of God, but in chapter 4 he was not afraid of God. Instead, he was arrogant toward God.</p>
<p>Most people ask, &ldquo;What was so bad about eating the fruit in the garden of Eden?&rdquo; They do not know that every unethical seed was concealed in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Its fruit refers to Satan&rsquo;s life. Thus, the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to Satan&rsquo;s life. After it entered into man, Satan&rsquo;s corrupting factor would grow out of it and eventually be lived out of man. At the beginning of chapter 4 Cain&rsquo;s service to God seemed to be in a good condition. However, his service slowly turned into anger, and he eventually slew his brother. By this time man was thoroughly corrupted. The above points are the process of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Result of Man&rsquo;s Second Fall</h2>
<p>We will now consider the result of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Greater and Severer Curse</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second fall brought a greater and severer curse upon man. In 4:11-12 God told Cain, &ldquo;Now you are cursed from the ground...When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you.&rdquo; After the first fall the ground was cursed to bring forth thorns and thistles (3:18), but after the second fall the ground stopped yielding its strength to man. The further man fell, the more he was cursed. All the problems that man encounters are due to the curse man incurred in the fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Fugitive and a Wanderer</h2>
<p>Verse 12 of chapter 4 goes on to say, &ldquo;You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.&rdquo; Although man was driven out of the garden of Eden by God after the first fall (3:22-24), man had a fixed dwelling place. After the second fall, however, man no longer had a fixed dwelling place. Cain became a wanderer without a dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Driven Out from the Face of God</h2>
<p>The third result of man&rsquo;s second fall is that he was driven out from the face of God (4:14). In the first fall man was driven out from God&rsquo;s dwelling place, but he could still see God&rsquo;s face. In the second fall man was driven out from God&rsquo;s face; thus, he could no longer see God&rsquo;s face. This was a very serious result.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Producing a Godless Culture</h2>
<p>The final result of man&rsquo;s second fall was the producing of a godless culture. Verses 16 through 24 of chapter 4 say, &ldquo;Cain went forth from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech. And Lamech took two wives for himself: The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah. And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise cattle. And his brother&rsquo;s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. And Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; / O wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech; / For I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me. / If Cain is avenged sevenfold, / Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.&rdquo; At the beginning of chapter 4, Cain served God according to his own will. By the end of chapter 4 Cain and his descendants had invented a godless culture. When man went further away from God and lost God&rsquo;s face, he was left with only one path, a godless culture. Originally, man had God. God took care of man, and man relied on God. God was responsible for and took care of everything. Furthermore, God was man&rsquo;s joy. However, when man fell and was driven out from the face of God, he lost God. As a result, God was not responsible for man and could not take care of man as He once did. Hence, man lost his supply, joy, and security and was afraid of all the calamities that would befall him because of losing God. Therefore, man invented culture so that he could sustain, defend, safeguard, and entertain himself. This is the background of the godless human culture. Such a godless culture is the result of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>The first step of Cain&rsquo;s creation of a godless human culture was the building of a city for his existence. Cain built the city of Enoch, which was the first city on earth (v. 17). It was also the beginning of building, construction, in the world. This construction was the result and the proof of man&rsquo;s departure from God. The more man sins and falls and the further he goes from God, the more he plans and builds something on the earth. Building for one&rsquo;s existence on the earth always speaks of man being far away from God. Cain built a city for self-defense because he was afraid that people would kill him. Initially, man dwelt in the garden that God had prepared, but after the fall he could only dwell in the city that he had built.</p>
<p>The second step of the creation of a godless human culture was man&rsquo;s inventing cattle-raising for his living. &ldquo;Jabal...was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise cattle&rdquo; (v. 20). Nomadic living began with Cain&rsquo;s descendant, Jabal. Such a nomadic living was the means of living in man&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>The third step of the creation of a godless human culture was the invention of music for entertainment. &ldquo;Jubal...was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe&rdquo; (v. 21). This proves that music played a very important role in man&rsquo;s godless culture. Music began with Jubal; it was his invention. He was born of a lust-indulging father who married multiple wives: &ldquo;Lamech took two wives for himself&rdquo; (v. 19, cf. v. 23). His mother was an ornament- and amusement-loving mother. <em>Adah</em> means &ldquo;ornament,&rdquo; or &ldquo;amusement,&rdquo; in Hebrew (vv. 20-21). The father&rsquo;s indulgence of lust, the mother&rsquo;s ornaments and amusement, and the son&rsquo;s music were the creation of the fallen human race.</p>
<p>Originally, God was man&rsquo;s joy and satisfaction. But these men did not have God as their joy or satisfaction, being far away from God and engrossed with material culture and construction. The male married multiple wives, the female adorned herself, and music was their amusement to divert their low feelings and their way to seek temporary pleasure. Modern amusements prove that man does not have God as his joy. Those who have God do not need such worldly amusements. We have drunk of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures and no longer need to drink of the water of this world (Psa. 36:8-9; John 4:13-14).</p>
<p>The fourth step in the creation of a godless human culture was man&rsquo;s invention of cutting instruments for self-defense. &ldquo;Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron&rdquo; (Gen. 4:22). Without God&rsquo;s protection, man had to think of ways to protect himself. Some of these cutting instruments were for living and work; others were for war. Man developed industries and prospered with these cutting instruments; he also conquered others and expanded his borders by these cutting instruments.</p>
<p>Existence, amusement, and self-defense are the content of the godless human culture. Can you think of anything in human culture or living that is not included in these three categories? When man lost God, he developed these three things in order to survive. After man&rsquo;s second fall, human culture began with Cain and his descendants.</p>
<p>The consequences of developing a godless human culture are terrible. The corrupting factor is manifested at the very beginning of man&rsquo;s fall. In verse 19 there is a beginning with polygamy. This means that there was the indulgence of lust and adultery. This is the first consequence of a godless human culture. When man is away from God and engrossed in material culture and construction, he will indulge his lusts. The more human culture develops and the more advanced human construction is, the more man&rsquo;s lusts increase. The indulgence of man&rsquo;s lusts always increases with the advancement of material culture and construction. The countries with the best material culture and the cities with the best material construction often have the worst indulgence of lusts. For example, the dance ballrooms that are so prevalent in so-called civilized countries promote adulterous acts, but many highly cultured people do not sense this corruption.</p>
<p>Another consequence of developing a godless human culture is killing. Lamech said, &ldquo;I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me&rdquo; (v. 23). Thus, there were many incidents of killing others. Initially, Cain killed his brother, but later, killing was pervasive among the descendants of Cain. The murderous forefather begot murderous descendants.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that the more human culture develops, the more incidents of ferocious killings there are. In the present atomic age the world has already had two world wars less than fifty years into the twentieth century. The consequence of a developed godless human culture is much killing. This is the greatest tragedy of mankind.</p>
<p>In conclusion, man&rsquo;s second fall brought a greater curse upon man, making him a fugitive and a wanderer driven out from God&rsquo;s face and completely severed from God. However, man still needed to survive; he had to build a city and sustain, entertain, and defend himself. This is the cause for man&rsquo;s invention of culture. The further away a man is from God, the more he seeks a godless culture. A godless culture demonstrates a fallen human life. Human history proves that the more advanced human culture is, the more fallen man is.</p>
<p>Man is utterly fallen when his culture does not want God. If man lived before God, human culture would want God. God would be the center and the content of such a culture. A culture with God demonstrates that man is not fallen but saved by God. All godless cultures are going downhill, following Cain&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second fall is the result of his acting according to his own will and going further away from God. Man&rsquo;s will was also exercised to invent a godless culture. Therefore, man&rsquo;s second fall was a matter of his will versus God&rsquo;s will. Man&rsquo;s living by his own will caused him to fall a second time, and the result of man&rsquo;s going away from God&rsquo;s face was the producing of a godless culture.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SECOND FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ESCAPE THE FURTHER FALL</h2>
<p>After man&rsquo;s first fall, there was a dealing from God and a promise. After man&rsquo;s second fall, there was no dealing from God, but there was a way for man to escape this further fall. Genesis 4 shows how Cain and his descendants fell, and it shows how another group of people escaped the fall. In chapter 3 there is only one group of people, but in chapter 4 there are two groups: Cain and his descendants, and Abel and those who succeeded Abel.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 mentions many people who were on the line of Cain, and it also mentions three other persons&mdash;Abel, Seth, and Enosh&mdash;who were not on the line of the fall.</p>
<p>We need to consider how Abel&rsquo;s group escaped the fall while Cain fell. The fall that began with Adam and continued with Cain went on at an increasingly fast pace. However, Abel, Seth, and Enosh were not in the fall, because they found a way out and lived in this way</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ESCAPE<br />
IN LIGHT OF MAN&rsquo;S SECOND FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Following One&rsquo;s Own Will</h2>
<p>In order to find the way to escape the fall, we need to consider those who were in Cain&rsquo;s group. They fell because they followed their own will. Hence, the first step in escaping the fall is to not follow our own will. After man fell, Satan entered into him. Hence, the element of Satan is in man&rsquo;s self with his opinions and ideas. When man follows his own will, he is following Satan and continuing in the fall. Hence, in order to escape the fall, man must reject his own will, deny his own will, and not walk according to his own will.</p>
<p>Even though Cain walked according to his own will, he did not begin to fall further by committing a great sin; rather, he was attempting to serve God. A similar situation can be found in Matthew 16. Peter loved the Lord, and when he heard that the Lord would die, he was concerned about the Lord. Hence, he took the Lord aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (v. 22). Apparently, Peter was not opposing the Lord; he was expressing his love for the Lord. However, the Lord turned and said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (v. 23). We need to see the significance of this. We should not think that we are walking according to our own will only when we commit sins or do something evil. We may walk according to our own will even in loving the Lord. It was not a sin for Peter to love the Lord, but Satan was hidden in Peter. The Lord did not say, &ldquo;Peter, you are following Satan.&rdquo; Instead, the Lord said, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men&rdquo; (v. 23). The Lord&rsquo;s word shows that Satan is in man&rsquo;s thoughts. Setting our mind on the things of men is setting our mind on Satan, and walking according to our own will is following Satan. Therefore, the first step in escaping from the fall is to deny the self.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning denying the self in verse 24 means that we must deny our opinions, thoughts, and intents, because Satan is hidden in them. In Genesis 3 Satan was in the serpent. In chapter 4 he was not hiding in something outside of man, but he was in man&rsquo;s opinions. Human opinions are the embodiment of Satan. Hence, when a person follows his opinions, he is following Satan. In order to overcome Satan&rsquo;s stratagem and to escape from the fall, we must deny the self and not follow our will.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 both Cain and Abel served God and presented an offering to God. Cain offered the fruit of his labor from the ground, but Abel killed lambs from his flock and offered them to God. Cain&rsquo;s offering was based on his own view; it lacked God&rsquo;s revelation. Abel&rsquo;s offering was according to God&rsquo;s revelation, not according to a method that he had conceived.</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve fell, they saw the shame from sin in themselves. Therefore, they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths to cover their shame (3:7). Making loincloths to cover their shame was something according to their opinion and method. However, God showed them the way of redemption by killing a lamb. The lamb died, and its blood was shed on their behalf. When God made coats of skin to cover their shame, Adam and Eve no longer had fear or shame. They must have been deeply impressed that even though they were fallen and sinful, they could live before God in boldness without a sense of shame and without a need for their own work. The loincloths that they made out of leaves could not cover their shame or give their conscience boldness before God. Only a sacrifice that died and shed its blood could give their conscience peace before God, and only the skin of that sacrifice could cover their shame. This must have deeply impressed them.</p>
<p>After Adam and Eve had children, they must have told their children how God created them, placed them in front of the tree of life, and warned them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They must have told their children how they violated this command and offended God. They must have told their children of the fear and guilt that they had felt within and how they had used their own method to cover their shame. They must have told their children of their hatred of the serpent and how God cursed the serpent and promised that a seed of woman would deal with him. And they must have told their children how God killed a sacrifice, shed its blood, and made coats of skin to cover their shame so that they could live before Him in boldness. Adam and Eve must have repeatedly told their children these things. They may be considered the first ones to preach the gospel. Hebrews 11:4 says, &ldquo;By faith Abel offered to God.&rdquo; Romans 10:14 says, &ldquo;How shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one who proclaims Him?&rdquo; Because Abel offered a sacrifice by faith to God, he must have heard the story of God&rsquo;s provision of a sacrifice for man from his parents.</p>
<p>Both Cain and Abel heard the gospel, but Cain did not believe. He put aside what he heard from his parents and refused to take the way that God had shown. In offering to God the fruit of his labor, the produce of the ground, he used his own method. The produce of the ground could not shed blood or pass through death. This means that Cain wanted to please God by his own conduct, work, and labor. He felt that he was good and that the fruit of his labor was something worthy that he could offer to God. He did not have any consciousness of sin; instead, he was proud of himself before God.</p>
<p>This was not the case with Abel. Abel heard the word of the gospel and believed. He knew that man was sinful and that human labor, conduct, and work could not please God. Because man is sinful, there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood (Heb. 9:22). Therefore, Abel was humble, knowing that he was sinful and that only the blood of a vicarious sacrifice could please God. Cain&rsquo;s offering was according to his own will, without any regard for God&rsquo;s revelation and instruction. Abel&rsquo;s offering was according to God&rsquo;s gospel and revelation. His offering was not according to his own will. Hence, he was delivered from following his own will, which is the first step of Satan&rsquo;s stratagem to bring man into a further fall.</p><h2 class="head2">Living for God</h2>
<p>The second step in escaping the fall is to live for God. Abel was a tender of sheep. At that time God did not allow man to eat meat. God allowed man to eat meat only after Noah and his family came out of the ark (Gen. 9:3-4). The use of sheep as an offering to God and sheepskin as a covering for man&rsquo;s shame typify the two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Hence, Abel&rsquo;s occupation was to serve God and live for God. In contrast, Cain tilled the ground in order to produce food. He was for his own living and for feeding himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, the second step in escaping the fall is to live for God. We should not take these things as doctrine. We need to be watchful, because when we care only for our living and food, we are in the fall. In order to escape from continuing in the fall, we must make serving God and living for God our priority. Regrettably, the priority of many Christians on the earth is their living and food. People have committed many evils in order to maintain their livelihood. If we want to overcome evil things, the first step is to overcome our prioritization of our livelihood. We should not live on the earth for food; we should live for God. We should take God as our goal, center, living, and purpose. Living for God is a great salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Vanity of Human Life</h2>
<p>The third step in escaping the fall is to know the vanity of human life. This is revealed in the name <em>Abel,</em> which means &ldquo;vanity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dissipating,&rdquo; like smoke, clouds, or air. Fallen human life is vanity. If fallen man is not saved by God and delivered out of his own will to live for God, his human life is vanity.</p>
<p>Solomon, who was the wisest king, said, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (Eccl. 1:2). He understood that the ultimate issue of human life is vanity of vanities. A human life without God, a fallen human life, is a vain human life. Abel knew this vanity, so he put aside his opinions and disregarded his own living in order to live for God according to the revelation of God. Abel realized that everything outside of God is vanity; hence, he despised everything outside of God and took God as the goal of his living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Frailty of Man</h2>
<p>The fourth step in escaping the fall is to know the frailty of man. <em>Enosh</em> is another interesting name in Genesis 4. <em>Enosh</em> means &ldquo;frail, mortal man.&rdquo; This implies that to escape from walking on the path of the fall, we need to know the frailty of man. We need to know that man is nothing and can break, just as a glass cup breaks easily. This is frailty. Man is frail. Some people do not know themselves. They think that they are smart, wise, and strong, when in fact they have nothing of which to boast. When a car hits a man, he is as fragile as a glass cup. When he is infected with tuberculosis, he must lie down. He may even die from tuberculosis. Man&rsquo;s life is frail. Man&rsquo;s name is Abel, but man&rsquo;s name is also Enosh. <em>Abel</em> means that man is vain, but <em>Enosh</em> means that man is frail. People who dream about their life should wake up. Man is not strong. Man will collapse when he is sick, and he will die if a car hits him. A wife can collapse when she is mad at her husband. She can even get ulcers because of her anger. A person can live to be one hundred years at most. The Chinese say that few can live to the age of seventy. Being fifty years old is not yet the twilight hour, but it is already four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Some people are at eight or nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening. There is a hymn that says, &ldquo;Swift to its close ebbs our life&rsquo;s little day&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #370, stanza 2). People must wake up from their dreams, because human life is vain and frail. In order to escape the fall, we must realize the meaning of human life. Those who continue in the fall do not know their own human life. In chapter 4 those who were delivered out of the fall knew that human life is vain and frail.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Calling on the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>The fifth step in escaping the fall is to call upon the name of Jehovah (Gen. 4:26). <em>Jehovah</em> means the &ldquo;self-existing and ever-existing One.&rdquo; Man is Enosh, but God is Jehovah. Man is frail and mortal, but God is self-existing, ever-existing, and eternal. Enosh called upon Jehovah because he knew that he was temporal, frail, and mortal, and he fully entrusted himself to God. Enosh knew that God is eternal, immortal, and reliable, because He is Jehovah.</p>
<p>We need to understand the meaning of the first four chapters of Genesis. The way of Cain is the way of following one&rsquo;s own will, the way of living for oneself. Those who walked on this way did not know the vanity of human life, nor did they sense the frailty of human life. They felt that they were capable in building cities and inventing cultures, but they did not know that they were taking the way of the fall. Abel, Seth, and Enosh were a different group of people. They did not follow their own will but instead lived by God. They knew that human life is vain, frail, and mortal; hence, they offered sacrifices to God, served God, and called upon the name of Jehovah. This is how they escaped from the fall.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE ISSUE OF THE FALL AND<br />
THE WAY TO ESCAPE IT</h2>
<p>Genesis 5 shows the ultimate issue of the fall and the way to escape it. On the surface, this chapter is the record of a genealogy. However, we should not treat this chapter merely as a genealogy, because God uses words very economically. Every word and every sentence in the Bible is concise. Nothing is written without a reason. This chapter of genealogy must have a deep meaning. We must find its intrinsic significance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Issue Being Death</h2>
<p>Although Genesis 3 and 4 unveil the two falls of man, they do not show the ultimate issue of the fall. In chapter 5, however, we see the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall and the way to escape it.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is written in a very particular way. This account of Adam and his descendants uses three words&mdash;<em>begot, lived,</em> and <em>died</em>. For example, Adam died, Seth died, and Enosh died. Except for Enoch, who walked with God and was not, for God took him (v. 24), all the rest died. Therefore, the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall is death. If someone is going to write our biography, the last word would be either death or burial. A biography usually starts with birth and ends with death and burial. Death is the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall. No matter how powerful and accomplished a person may be, he will eventually die, because death is the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Escape Death</h2>
<p>The ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall is death. The way to escape death is unveiled in chapter 5.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking with God by Not Overstepping God<br />
and by Taking God as the Center</h2>
<p>The way to escape death is to walk with God. Man&rsquo;s first fall was his overstepping of God. The second fall was man&rsquo;s putting God aside. In chapter 5, however, there was a man, Enoch, who walked with God (v. 22); he took God as his center and did not turn away from God or abandon God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>What would it mean if we reversed the order of <em>Enoch</em> and <em>God</em> in verse 22 and said that God walked with Enoch? What is the difference between God walking with Enoch, and Enoch walking with God? If God walked with Enoch, then Enoch would have been the center and the lord, but God was the center and the Lord because Enoch walked with God. Enoch did not take himself as the center or assume the headship. Rather, he took God as his center and his head. He followed God and walked with God.</p>
<p>Man fell and ended up in death because he overstepped God and assumed the headship and because he put aside God&rsquo;s will and followed his own will. As a result, man forsook God, took the way of death, and fell into death. God is life. If we want to escape death, we must touch life; that is, we need to follow God, taking Him as our center, our Lord, and our Head. We should not overstep Him or put His will aside; rather, we should walk with Him.</p>
<p>When we overstep God and put His will aside, we will touch death and fall into death. When we drop our human opinions and focus on God&rsquo;s will, taking Him as our center in everything, we will escape the way of death. God is life. Hence, when we touch Him, we touch life. This is a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Believing In God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>Genesis 5:21-22 says, &ldquo;Enoch lived sixty-five years and begot Methuselah. And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methuselah three hundred years.&rdquo; Why did Enoch walk with God after he begot Methuselah? The name <em>Methuselah</em> means &ldquo;when he is dead, it [the judgment of the flood] will be sent.&rdquo; If we study the Bible carefully, we will see that the name Methuselah was actually a prophecy. According to Genesis 4 and 6, by the time of Enoch mankind had become extremely evil. Enoch had a God-fearing heart, became a prophet of God, and received inspiration from God, knowing that one day God would execute judgment upon the corrupted generation of mankind. After Enoch begot a son, he must have been inspired by the Holy Spirit to know that his generation would be judged on the day of his son&rsquo;s death. Therefore, having a God-fearing heart, Enoch named his son Methuselah. God used this name to warn Enoch and the people who were living then that the judgment would come when Methuselah died. No one knew when he would die, but Enoch took heed to the warning. He was in fear and trembling and dared not act carelessly. This is the way that he walked with God.</p>
<p>Enoch walked with God three hundred years, which was six hundred years before the death of Methuselah. Enoch&rsquo;s life was short, because people at that time lived at least six hundred or seven hundred years. Therefore, Enoch was taken while he was still young and strong. This was God&rsquo;s mercy to him so that he did not have to remain on the earth. It was sufficient for him to walk with God for three hundred years, so he was taken. Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years and begot Lamech (v. 25). Lamech lived a hundred eighty-two years and begot a son named Noah (vv. 28-29). Noah lived six hundred years, and the flood came (7:6, 11). When the flood came, Methuselah was exactly nine hundred and sixty-nine years old.</p>
<p>Enoch walked with God, and he also believed God&rsquo;s word. Walking with God means not overstepping God. Believing God&rsquo;s word means not putting God&rsquo;s will aside. We know that Enoch believed God&rsquo;s word, because when Enoch begot a son at the age of sixty-five, he received a revelation from the Holy Spirit concerning God&rsquo;s will: &ldquo;When he is dead, it [the judgment of the flood] will be sent.&rdquo; Enoch named his son Methuselah according to this revelation because he believed this word, and he walked with a heart that feared God.</p>
<p>By walking with God and believing God&rsquo;s word, Enoch escaped the factors of the two falls. The first fall was due to man&rsquo;s assuming the headship, and the second fall was due to man&rsquo;s putting aside God&rsquo;s will. Enoch overcame these two factors. He did not assume the headship, and he walked with God, taking God as his center. He did not hold on to his own opinions. Rather, he believed God&rsquo;s word. He believed what God said to him; hence, he took the way of escaping death. If we want to escape the issue of death, we also need to learn these two points. First, we should not overstep God but return to Him and allow Him to be our Head and Lord. Second, we should put aside our views and opinions, believe His word, and accept His will. Then we will overcome the factors of the two falls, and we will escape death. This is the intrinsic significance of Genesis 5.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE THIRD FALL OF MAN</h1>
<p>Genesis 6 through 8 speaks of the third fall of man, which brought in the destruction by the deluge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAUSE OF MAN&rsquo;S THIRD FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Evil Spirits Mixed with Man</h2>
<p>Verse 4 of chapter 6 says, &ldquo;The sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them.&rdquo; Some expositors say that <em>sons of God</em> in this verse refers to the descendants of Seth, that is, to people who belonged to God. According to the record of the Bible, however, this interpretation is not accurate. Job 1:6 and 2:1 clearly speak of the angels as being the sons of God. The Syriac Version of the Old Testament renders <em>sons of God</em> as &ldquo;angels.&rdquo; The angels who came in to the daughters of men were the angels who did not keep their own principality, as mentioned in Jude 6. The angels who did not keep their own principality committed fornication with human beings. By doing so, Satan corrupted man to the uttermost in the age before the deluge. He not only tempted man with outward things in the first fall and corrupted man with human opinions in the second fall, but he also mixed evil spirits with the human race.</p>
<p>Genesis 6:4 says, &ldquo;The Nephilim were on the earth in those days&mdash;and also afterward&mdash;when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them.&rdquo; <em>Nephilim,</em> or giants, in Hebrew means &ldquo;the fallen ones.&rdquo; When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, there were the Nephilim in that land. God wanted to kill the Canaanites because there were Nephilim among the seven Canaanite nations (Num. 13:32-33); these Nephilim were the result of the mixture of fallen angels with fallen mankind. God destroyed all the people in Noah&rsquo;s generation with the flood, not only because they were corrupt but also because they were a mixed race. When these evil spirits were mixed with man, man became extraordinarily lustful and corrupt.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Becoming Flesh</h2>
<p>The first fall of man involved man assuming the headship. The second fall involved man following his own will. The third fall involved man becoming flesh (Gen. 6:12). These three causes speak of the three steps of the fall of man. Assuming the headship is the result of man not exercising his spirit to contact God. God is Spirit, and if man is to live before God and contact God, he must live in the spirit, contacting God with the spirit (John 4:24). However, in the first fall man overstepped God and assumed the headship, because he did not exercise his spirit. In the second fall man followed his own will; that is, he lived by the soul. In the third fall man lived by the flesh and became even more corrupt. By not living by the spirit or the soul, man became flesh and lived by the flesh. Because evil spirits were mixed with the human body, man&rsquo;s lust in the body became very active, becoming capable of committing all kinds of evil. This is the cause of man&rsquo;s third fall. On the one hand, Satan is the cause of every fall of man; on the other hand, man&rsquo;s cooperation with Satan is also the cause.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF MAN&rsquo;S THIRD FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Following the Flesh</h2>
<p>The process of man&rsquo;s third fall began with man following the flesh, which is full of lusts. At this time man did not even care about reason; he lived and indulged in his lust, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually (Gen. 6:5). As a result, his whole being was corrupt. In the first fall man forsook his spirit. In the second fall man followed his soul. Moreover, in the third fall man followed the flesh and lived in the lusts of the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Becoming Evil and Corrupt to the Uttermost</h2>
<p>The second part of the process of man&rsquo;s third fall was man becoming evil and corrupt to the uttermost. At that time &ldquo;God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth. And God said...I am about to destroy them with the earth&rdquo; (vv. 12-13). At that time man not only was corrupt but also became a mixed race with evil spirits. Man was so corrupt that even God, who is the most tolerant, could not tolerate it any longer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE THIRD FALL OF MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Withdrawing of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The first issue of man being corrupt to the uttermost was the withdrawing of the Holy Spirit. In the first fall man was driven out of the dwelling place of God, but man was still able to see the face of God. In the second fall man was driven out from the countenance of God, becoming unable to see the face of God. But God, being gracious, still sent His Holy Spirit to inspire man and strive with man. In the third fall of man God could no longer do anything. The Spirit of God had no choice but to withdraw from striving with man, because man had become flesh (v. 3). Thus, man was completely separated from God and forsaken by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Coming of the Deluge</h2>
<p>After the Holy Spirit withdrew, the deluge came, which brought in the judgment of destruction. Except for Noah&rsquo;s family of eight, every fallen human being was destroyed by the deluge (vv. 13, 17-18; 7:13, 17-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF SALVATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Walking with God</h2>
<p>The way of salvation from the third fall was exactly the same as the way to escape death at the time of Enoch. Noah was born sixty-nine years after Enoch was taken up. Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years and begot Lamech. Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years and begot Noah (5:25, 28-29). Like Enoch, Noah walked with God (6:9). Noah must have heard about the godly deeds of his great-grandfather, Enoch, and must have been influenced by the godly living of Enoch. Hence, Noah also walked with God, just as his great- grandfather did.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believing In the Word of God</h2>
<p>Noah also believed in the word of God. God told him that the deluge would come, and he believed Him. God told him to build an ark, and he built it. God told him to enter the ark, and he entered it. God told him to stay in the ark, and he stayed in the ark. God told him to come out of the ark, and he came out of the ark (6:13&mdash;7:16; 8:15-18). He walked completely according to God&rsquo;s word. This shows that Noah absolutely believed in the word of God. Because he believed in the word of God, he was saved. The way that he took was exactly the same as the way of his great-grandfather, Enoch&mdash;taking God as the center, not assuming the headship, and taking God&rsquo;s opinion as his opinion. As a result, he was saved and delivered from the fall.</p>
<p>We need to see that the fall of man was due to man assuming the headship, following his own will, and following the flesh. The way of salvation is by walking with God, taking God as the center, dropping one&rsquo;s own opinions, and following God&rsquo;s speaking. This is the way of following God and the way of salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FOURTH FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE LINE OF LIFE IN THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>This series of messages is not a verse-by-verse study like an ordinary Bible-study. On the contrary, we want to see the line pertaining to life in the Word of God. Apart from the line of life, there are many other significant points in Genesis, such as the ark in chapters 6 through 8. Even so, we must emphasize that our intention is not to study Genesis in order to identify every item of truth in it. Rather, our intention is to see the line of life.</p>
<p>Our burden is also not to expound the Bible but to speak concerning life. Bible exposition alone is for the increase of human knowledge, but the line of life is for man to know God. Our desire is not merely to help the children of God to increase their biblical knowledge. Instead, our earnest hope is that we can see the way pertaining to God&rsquo;s life in the Word of God. Therefore, instead of merely studying with our mind, we should open our spirit and be willing to see the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s life and to know the way of God&rsquo;s life. This is not a matter pertaining to knowledge but a matter pertaining to life.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden there were two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The issue of touching the tree of life is life, whereas the issue of touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. All biblical truths include a certain amount of knowledge, but our speaking will be a failure if we cause people only to gain knowledge rather than touch the life of God.</p>
<p>In John 6:63 the Lord clearly said that the words He spoke are spirit and life. I hope that when we study the Lord&rsquo;s Word, our spirit will touch the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s life. Therefore, when we study, we should not come to comprehend only with our mind, but even more we need to have a heart and a spirit to touch God and contact His Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION, MAN&rsquo;S FALL, AND GOD&rsquo;S CALLING</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the fourth fall of man. In brief, man&rsquo;s first fall was in the garden of Eden (Gen. 3), the second fall was with Cain (ch. 4), and the third fall was before the deluge (ch. 6). Man&rsquo;s fall involved more than one step. Once man began to fall, he fell step after step. Once man fell, he continued to fall. The first fall in the garden of Eden was the beginning, the first step, of the fall of mankind. After that step, there was a second step. After the second step, there was a third step, and after the third step, there was a fourth step. After the fourth step, man had fallen to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Genesis is divided into three major sections: the first section is on God&rsquo;s creation (chs. 1&mdash;2), the second section is on man&rsquo;s fall (3:1&mdash;11:9), and the third section is on God&rsquo;s calling (11:10&mdash;50). We have already seen God&rsquo;s creation in previous messages (see <em>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God&rsquo;s Desire and Purpose in Creation)</em>. In regard to man&rsquo;s fall, there is a total of four steps, which constitute man&rsquo;s complete fall; therefore, we refer to them as the four falls of man. The first fall in the garden of Eden was like man&rsquo;s enrollment in a &ldquo;school of falling,&rdquo; whereas his fourth fall was like his graduation from this school. Adam&rsquo;s fall was merely the beginning of the fall. It was not until the fourth step of the fall that the fall of the entire human race was complete.</p>
<p>The Adamic race became incurable and hopeless in God&rsquo;s eyes because of these continuing falls, and God had no choice but to give up on the Adamic race, that is, to give up on the human race. This does not mean, however, that God had no further work with mankind. Instead, God had a new beginning. God&rsquo;s first beginning was His creation of man. After created man fell to the uttermost, God had a new beginning by coming to call man. The man whom He called was Abraham. The record in the Bible from Genesis 11:10 to the end of Revelation is not a record of the Adamic race. God gave up on the Adamic race because of its repeated falls, but after man fell to the uttermost, God called Abraham and his descendants, that is, the Abrahamic race. After Genesis 11:10 the Bible covers the Abrahamic race. The remainder of the Old Testament covers Abraham&rsquo;s earthly descendants, and the entirety of the New Testament covers Abraham&rsquo;s heavenly descendants. Every Gentile believer in the Lord has become a son of Abraham through faith (Gal. 3:7, 29). Therefore, the emphasis from Genesis 11:10 to the end of the New Testament is altogether on the Abrahamic race, the called race.</p>
<p>Hebrews 3:1 says that we, the saved ones, are &ldquo;partakers of a heavenly calling.&rdquo; As saved ones, we are God&rsquo;s called ones. The first section of the Bible covers the created race, the Adamic race; the second section covers the called race, the Abrahamic race.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CAUSE OF MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<p>We need to consider the cause of man&rsquo;s fourth fall. In each of the four falls there is a cause related to Satan and a cause related to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Instigation of Satan</h2>
<p>On Satan&rsquo;s side, the cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was Satan&rsquo;s tempting of man by hiding himself in the serpent. The cause of the second fall was Satan&rsquo;s deception of man by hiding in man&rsquo;s will. The cause of the third fall was due to the mixing of evil spirits with man. The cause of the fourth fall was Satan&rsquo;s instigation of man to rebel against God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Rebellion of the Human Race</h2>
<p>On man&rsquo;s side, the cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was man&rsquo;s assumption of the headship. The cause of the second fall was man&rsquo;s acting according to his own will. The cause of the third fall was man&rsquo;s acting according to the flesh. The cause of the fourth fall was man&rsquo;s rebellion against God, his rising up to oppose God.</p>
<p>In the first fall mankind had not yet rebelled against God. At that time man committed sin, but he still had a heart that feared and revered God. Although man violated God&rsquo;s prohibition, he still feared God. In the second fall man was corrupted and became arrogant toward God, but his heart was still fearful of God. Although Cain sinned and was dealt with by God, Cain and his descendants still acknowledged God. Among his descendants, some had names that included the Hebrew root <em>el,</em> meaning &ldquo;God,&rdquo; indicating that they still acknowledged God&rsquo;s right and authority and were not rebellious toward God. Among Cain&rsquo;s descendants, one was named Mehujael, meaning &ldquo;opposed by God&rdquo; or &ldquo;smitten of God,&rdquo; and another was named Methushael, meaning &ldquo;man of God&rdquo; (Gen. 4:18). Even after the third fall of mankind, man still acknowledged God&rsquo;s right and authority. Although man was utterly corrupt in his morality individually, he did not rise up to oppose God collectively or to rebel against God&rsquo;s right and authority collectively. However, the fourth fall was not related to individual conduct or behavior; it was a collective rebellion to deny God&rsquo;s right and authority.</p>
<p>In considering the four falls of mankind, man&rsquo;s violation of God&rsquo;s prohibition in the first fall can be likened to making a mistake. In the second fall man committed an individual act of murder. In the third fall all the people on earth began to indulge in lusts, murder, and fornication. Although this process shows a continuing corruption, it still involves problems related only to individual behavior. However, in the fourth fall people conferred with one another to collectively rebel against God in heaven. In this fall mankind collectively rebelled to deny God&rsquo;s right and authority.</p>
<p>Satan instigated this fall because his intention when he rebelled was to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority. According to Isaiah 14:13-14, Satan said in his heart, &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven...I will exalt my throne...I will make myself like the Most High.&rdquo; Hence, the thought of overthrowing God&rsquo;s authority is entirely of the evil one, Satan. He wanted to overthrow God&rsquo;s throne, but he did not succeed. At the time of the fourth fall he imparted the thought of overthrowing God&rsquo;s authority into man, causing man to rise up collectively to oppose God&rsquo;s right and authority. At that time the people said, &ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top is in the heavens&rdquo; (Gen. 11:4). To have a tower with its top in the heavens was to set themselves against the heavens. They seemed to say, &ldquo;Since God is working to come down from heaven to the earth, we will work to go up from the earth to heaven.&rdquo; They opposed God to this extent, and their intention in building a tower was to make a name for themselves. God considered this fall as something that could no longer be tolerated. The previous three falls were related to the corruption of individual morality and behavior, which could be considered as falls on a smaller scale. The fourth fall, however, which involved the rebellion of mankind collectively, was a fall on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>The universe cannot be without authority, and the authority in the universe is God. Man was created by God and therefore should be under God&rsquo;s government and authority. However, in Genesis 11 the human race united together to deny God&rsquo;s authority collectively and to exalt man to the heavens. They attempted to build a tower with its top in the heavens. They said, &ldquo;Let us make a name for ourselves&rdquo; (v. 4), meaning that they intended to exalt man and put God aside. This was not an issue of individual morality or behavior but an issue of authority, an issue of collective rebellion. In God&rsquo;s eyes this was an extremely serious matter.</p>
<p>The fourth fall may be likened to a family with four children who at first are secretly disobedient to their father&rsquo;s forbidding word. Later, the eldest brother may hit his younger brothers, and still later, all four may create a mess by playing in the house. However, none of these acts are as serious as all four saying, &ldquo;Down with our father! Let us be the king!&rdquo; This is no longer merely a matter of disobeying the father&rsquo;s word, hitting younger brothers, or turning the house into a mess; it is a matter of collectively overthrowing the father&rsquo;s position, a matter of exalting themselves to the position of the father. This is a serious matter. By the fourth fall man had fallen to the uttermost. In the first three falls God still wanted to rescue man. With the fourth fall, however, God came down to see the city and the tower that the children of men had built (v. 5), and He said, &ldquo;Come, let Us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech&rdquo; (v. 7). God seemed to say, &ldquo;We have to go down and see what they are doing. Created mankind is attempting to overthrow Our authority; this is very serious. Come, let Us confound their language and scatter them.&rdquo; This shows that the fourth fall was the most serious fall.</p>
<p>In the first fall man assumed the headship; that is, man did not live according to his spirit. In the second fall man lived according to his own will, his own idea, that is, according to his soul. To act according to one&rsquo;s will or idea is to live according to the soul. Not only was Cain&rsquo;s murder of his brother Abel an issue of living according to the soul, but even his offering to God was an issue of his living according to the soul. In the third fall, man lived according to the flesh.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s creation in the beginning, man should live according to the spirit, with the soul under the direction of the spirit, the body under the direction of the soul, and the spirit under the direction of God. In this way man and God can have a proper relationship. However, in the first fall man did not live according to the spirit but rather assumed the headship. In the second fall man lived according to the soul. In the third fall man fell into the flesh and lived according to the flesh. Thus, the more man fell, the more he fell from the inside to the outside.</p>
<p>The closer a person lives in relation to his deepest part, the spirit, the nobler he is. In contrast, the closer a person lives in relation to his flesh, the baser he is. The more a person lives according to his inward parts, the more virtuous he is, but the more he lives according to the lusts of his body, the more corrupt he is. Before the fall man had fellowship with God because he lived according to his innermost part, his spirit. He was honorable and noble. Man fell the first time because he failed to continue to live according to the innermost part, the central part, of his being. In effect, man fell from his innermost part into his soul to live according to the soul. This was man&rsquo;s first fall. When man fell yet again, he fell from his soul into the body, which became the flesh. The human body with Satan&rsquo;s sin became the flesh. The more a person lives in his flesh, the more he indulges in its lusts. The more a person comes under the control of his soul and then under the control of his body, the more corrupt he becomes. The Chinese sages speak of the bright virtue, which is man&rsquo;s conscience. By the time of the third fall, the function of man&rsquo;s conscience was made completely void, and man was living according to his flesh and indulging in its lusts.</p>
<p>After the third fall man had fallen into the flesh. However, there was still a fourth fall related to man&rsquo;s collective rebellion. At this point, man was completely of the flesh, and these fleshly people consulted one another, &ldquo;and they said to one another, Come&rdquo; (v. 3). These words indicate that they were going to rebel in a collective action. The first three falls resulted in a progressive corruption from the spirit to the flesh, resulting in the complete corruption of their entire being. However, in the fourth fall, they expressed an intention to rebel against God and to deny God&rsquo;s authority collectively. In God&rsquo;s eyes they were not only utterly corrupt but also extremely wicked. The first three falls involved matters of individual morality, but the fourth fall involved the matter of collective rebellion. This is very serious.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Discussing&mdash;Conferring to Rebel</h2>
<p>The process of man&rsquo;s fourth fall began with a discussion, a conference (v. 3). These corrupted people came together to confer over the matter of rebellion. They were created and governed by God originally, yet they met together to confer and discuss their intention to rebel. This was extremely wicked.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Bricks&mdash;<br />
Human Labor Plus the Mud of the Earth</h2>
<p>After their discussion, they took a further step of making bricks and burning them thoroughly (v. 3). The Bible always mentions the use of stones in relation to God&rsquo;s building and the use of bricks in relation to man&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Let us consider four items in God&rsquo;s work. According to Exodus 20:25, the altar was built with stones. It was not only built with stones but with stones in their original form, that is, unhewn stones. When the children of Israel built an altar with stones, they could not use tools. This means that the element of human labor should not be added to God&rsquo;s work. The temple in 1 Kings 6:7 was also built with stones. In addition, the city of Jerusalem was built with stones, and the city of the New Jerusalem, whose Architect and Builder is God (Heb. 11:10), will be built with precious stones (Rev. 21:18-20). God&rsquo;s building work involves stones, whereas man&rsquo;s building work involves bricks. The tower of Babel was built with bricks, and the two storage cities of Pharaoh were also built with bricks (Exo. 1:11, 14; 5:7-8).</p>
<p>Stones are natural and God-made; bricks are produced by human labor with the mud of the earth, that is, by using human labor to burn and harden the mud of the earth. God&rsquo;s work, however, is made with stones, meaning that God builds everything with something of Himself as the material. In contrast, man&rsquo;s work is made with bricks, meaning that it is accomplished with human labor using earthy things void of the element of God. Genesis 11:3 says that man used &ldquo;brick for stone&rdquo; when the tower of Babel was being built. This meant that man replaced God&rsquo;s work with his own work. In the Bible all the things made by man are &ldquo;bricks,&rdquo; that is, something of the earth plus human labor. Everything produced by human labor and earthy material is brick.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building a City&mdash;a Self-made, Godless Living</h2>
<p>After producing bricks, the people built a city. When reading Genesis 11, most people focus on the tower of Babel rather than on the city of Babel. This is not accurate, because verse 4 plainly says, &ldquo;They said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower.&rdquo; This verse mentions a city and then a tower. Hence, the emphasis is not on the tower but on the city. We know that a city is the center of human life, and therefore, it is a symbol of human life. A city made of bricks is a symbol of a life built by human labor, that is, a life without God. This shows that the kind of life that man builds does not have God, does not want God, does not rely on God, and is not for God. The city of Babel symbolizes such a life. The city of Babel represents a living produced by a group of fallen, rebellious people who put God aside, deny God&rsquo;s right and authority, and use their human labor on the things of the earth. Such a life has man but not God, wants man but not God, relies on man but not God, and is for man but not God. Such a living is symbolized by the city of Babel.</p>
<p>People on the earth today, including those in so-called religions, are still building the city of Babel. It is possible that even many works in Christianity are cities built only with human labor. If the work that we are doing in God&rsquo;s name is really being done by ourselves and for ourselves, our work is building only the city of Babel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building a Tower&mdash;<br />
a Declaration of the Renouncing of God</h2>
<p>After building a city, the next step was to build a tower. In chapter 11 the people built a city and then a tower. The city was central, whereas the tower was auxiliary. Using an analogy, we can say that the city was like a tomb, and the tower was like a tombstone that declared who is in a tomb. The tower of Babel was an epitaph, a declaration, of the city of Babel. Since the city of Babel is a symbol of a godless life built by men apart from God, the tower of Babel is a declaration that their life denied God and rejected His right and authority.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making a Name for Man&mdash;<br />
Renouncing God&rsquo;s Name, That Is,<br />
Renouncing God</h2>
<p>The building of the tower of Babel not only declared that the people did not want God but that they wanted to make a name for themselves. Their renouncing of God&rsquo;s name was actually their renouncing of God. Their making a name for themselves was actually their exalting of themselves. Genesis 4:26 says that men began to call upon the name of Jehovah at the time of Enosh. The name <em>Enosh</em> means &ldquo;frail, mortal man.&rdquo; When a person truly knows the vanity and frailty of human life, he will prostrate himself before God, call on God&rsquo;s name, and exalt God&rsquo;s name. However, men exalted their own name, making a name for themselves. Chapter 11 shows that people fell to the uttermost by building a city and a tower in order to make a name for themselves. However, God would not allow them to succeed in their conspiracy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Scattered&mdash;Not Being Able to Live Together<br />
in One Place</h2>
<p>Because the people intended to rebel against God collectively, He scattered them so that they would not be able to live together in one place (vv. 8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confounded&mdash;Not Being Able to Have<br />
the Same Language</h2>
<p>God confounded the people&rsquo;s language, causing them to not be able to understand one another&rsquo;s speech (v. 7). After God&rsquo;s confounding, they could, for example, no longer easily understand the word <em>come.</em> In order to understand one another&rsquo;s speech, there was a need for translation. Therefore, not having one language is God&rsquo;s judgment. When Jehovah confounded the language of all the people, they were scattered over the surface of all the earth. <em>Babel,</em> the name of the city, means &ldquo;confusion,&rdquo; which was the issue of being cursed and judged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE<br />
DELIVERED FROM MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<p>God had a way to deal with the first fall, a way of escape for the second fall, and a way of salvation for the third fall. However, there was no dealing, no escape, and no salvation for the fourth fall. There was only a revelation of a way for deliverance, as seen in Abraham&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leaving Everything<br />
Related to Background and Environment</h2>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s deliverance involved leaving everything related to his background and environment. When God called Abraham, He told Abraham to go from his land, from his relatives, and from his father&rsquo;s house (12:1), that is, to leave everything of his background and environment. At that time Abraham was in Chaldea (11:28), the land of Shinar, which was the place of man&rsquo;s rebellion against God, the source of man&rsquo;s rebellion against God (10:10; 11:2-4). Joshua 24:2 and 14 tell us that the land of Chaldea, the birthplace of Abraham, was a land full of idols. It was a place where people worshipped idols and exalted their own name. However, God came to call Abraham, telling him to leave everything of his background and environment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living a Life in Opposition<br />
to the City and Tower of Babel</h2>
<p>Abraham also lived a life that was altogether in opposition to the living in Babel. When he arrived in the land of Canaan, he pitched a tent, built an altar, and called on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 12:5, 7-8). Abraham&rsquo;s tent stood as a testimony in opposition to the city of Babel, and his altar stood as a testimony in opposition to the tower of Babel. A human city symbolizes a life without God, whereas a tent symbolizes a life with God. A human city symbolizes a life of not trusting in God, whereas a tent symbolizes a life of trusting in God. Abraham&rsquo;s life was the life of a tent, which was altogether contrary to Babel, and Abraham&rsquo;s distinctive mark was an altar, not a tower. The tower of Babel was a declaration of man&rsquo;s renunciation of God, whereas Abraham&rsquo;s altar was a mark of man&rsquo;s calling on God. The tower was for man&rsquo;s name, but the altar was for calling on the name of God. Abraham&rsquo;s life was completely in opposition to the living in Babel. Whereas the people of Babel had a city, Abraham had a tent. Whereas the people of Babel declared their renunciation of God, Abraham declared his acceptance of God. Whereas the people of Babel did not trust in God, Abraham trusted in God. Whereas the people of Babel built a tower to make a name for themselves, Abraham built an altar to call on the name of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF THE CITY AND THE LINE OF THE TENT</h2>
<p>At the time of Abraham&rsquo;s calling, the city of Babel and the tent of God were in opposition to each other. Ever since the fall of man, human life has been divided into two different lines. One line involves the living of those who follow Satan, those who are the seed of the serpent (3:15), which is a godless living symbolized by a city. The other line involves the living of those who belong to God, those who are the seed of the woman, which is a God-trusting life symbolized by a tent. In the Bible these two kinds of life are always in opposition. Actually, the opposition between the tent and the city did not begin with Babel. According to Genesis 4, Cain built a city called Enoch before the deluge (v. 17), and after Noah came out of the ark, he lived in a tent (9:21). Hence, Noah&rsquo;s tent and the city built by Cain were in opposition to each other. In chapter 12 Abraham&rsquo;s tent was an anti-testimony to the city of Babel. When the children of Israel were serving God in the wilderness, they dwelt in tents and pitched a tent of meeting for God (Exo. 33:7-8, 10). These tents were in opposition to the cities built by the children of Israel during their enslavement in Egypt (1:11). When they entered into Canaan, the city of Jerusalem, which was the enlargement of the tent, was also in opposition to the city of Babylon, which was the enlargement of the city of Babel. Ultimately, at the end of the Bible, Babylon the Great (Rev. 17&mdash;18) and the New Jerusalem (21:2-3, 9-27) are in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>The Bible is a record of these two lines: the line of the city and the line of the tent. The Bible tells a story of the city, beginning with Genesis 4 and continuing through Revelation 18. First, there is the city of Enoch built by Cain (Gen. 4:17); later there is the city of Babel (11:4, 9); still later there is the city of Babylon (Psa. 137:8; Isa. 13:19); and finally there is Babylon the Great (Rev. 14:8; 18:2). These are all on the same line. Another line is the line of the tent. First, there is the tent of Noah (Gen. 9:21); later there is the tent of Abraham (12:8); still later there is the city of Jerusalem, which was brought forth after the descendants of Abraham entered into the land of Canaan with the Ark of God (1 Kings 11:32, 36). Finally, there is the holy city, New Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from God. Although the New Jerusalem is a city, it is still called a tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3), and it is the ultimate issue of the line of the tent.</p>
<p>These two lines are never joined; their ways of life are completely different and always in opposition to one another. The line of the city is filled with idols and completely rejects God, whereas the line of the tent is filled with people who want God and trust in God completely. With a tent there is always an altar, and in the city of Jerusalem there was an altar (1 Kings 9:25; 12:27). An altar is a sign of man&rsquo;s need for God. When there is a &ldquo;city&rdquo; with a &ldquo;tower,&rdquo; people continually declare that they do not want God. When there is a &ldquo;tent&rdquo; with an &ldquo;altar,&rdquo; people continually declare that they want God. Man wants God, trusts in God, and takes God as his center so that everything is for God only when there is a tent and an altar.</p>
<p>The way to be delivered out of the fourth fall is by being called by God to leave our background and environment and by living a life in opposition to the living in Babel. Babel does not want God, but we want God. Babel makes a name for man, but we exalt God&rsquo;s name. By leaving our background and environment and by living a life in opposition to the living in Babel, we can be delivered and preserved from the fall.</p></body></html>
