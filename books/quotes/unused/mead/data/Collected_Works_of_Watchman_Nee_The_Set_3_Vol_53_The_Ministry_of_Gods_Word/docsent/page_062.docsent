   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BURDEN AND THE INNER WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us first consider the inner word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we receive light from God and after we have the thoughts, we only have enough material to have a burden, but this is not enough to discharge it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Light and thoughts can only become our burden; they cannot serve to discharge our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Light and thoughts must first become words to us; the thoughts must first become words before we can release these words through our voice to the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot utter our thoughts; we can only utter our words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot turn our thoughts into words extemporaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must first translate these thoughts into words before we can announce them to the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ministry of the word is different from ordinary speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With ordinary speaking, one can speak as long as he has thoughts; his speaking is based on his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same, however, is not true with the ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their thoughts must first be converted into words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their inner being must be filled not only with thoughts but with words as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will be able to release their inner word to the outside world only after they have both.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus served as the highest example of the minister of the word when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was not God's thoughts becoming flesh; He was God's Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A minister of the word must be supplied with words before he can serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One does not become a minister of the word simply by having thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thoughts must be converted into words before he can have a ministry before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we only have thoughts and no words except our own, we still are short of one thing, and we are not able to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need light, we need thoughts, and we need the inner words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we have light from God and after this light is retained in our thoughts, we have to learn to pray for words before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to pray and beseech Him before we will have the words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God's light shines into our spirit, it is a revelation; we have to translate this revelation into our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without revelation, there is no shining.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Shining is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the retaining of light by the thoughts is man's work, a work that belongs to those who have learned the proper lessons from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After light is translated into thoughts, there is still the need to translate the thoughts into words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We translate light into thoughts for ourselves, and we translate thoughts into words for others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we only intend to have light for ourselves, thoughts are good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in order for the light to be dispensed to others, these thoughts have to be translated into words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without thoughts, the light is too abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the light, thoughts are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the light must be translated into thoughts before it becomes tangible to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the thoughts must be translated into words before light becomes tangible to others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need thoughts to translate the light, and we need words to translate the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only then will we have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Light alone is not enough to qualify a person to be a minister of the word, and thoughts alone are not enough to qualify a person to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the combination of light and thoughts is not enough to qualify a person to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There must be light, thoughts, and words before one can serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need words to translate the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not refer to ordinary thoughts but to the thoughts that pertain to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our thoughts are the very light that we see.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet we cannot share these thoughts with others; they have to be converted into words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, another great step in the ministry of the word is to receive words from God to anchor and then to translate our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Light from God can only be retained with disciplined thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, we have to anchor these thoughts with words that also come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The words that anchor our thoughts must be from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes revelation is in the spirit, and sometimes it is in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let us consider these two things.</S>
