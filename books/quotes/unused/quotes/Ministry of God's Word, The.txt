The Ministry of God's Word contains eighteen lessons given by Watchman Nee to his co-workers in a training at Kuling between 1948 and 1949
We must be clear before the Lord that God's work is conveyed through His word and His word is released through man
In the Old Testament God's word was released through the prophets, that is, through the ministry of the prophets
In the remainder of the New Testament, God's word was released through the apostles, that is, through the ministry of the apostles
Balaam prophesied when the Spirit of God came upon him; that is, he involuntarily spoke what the Spirit told him to speak
Under the constraining and restraining power of the Holy Spirit, God's word was released through the Old Testament minister's mouth
In the Old Testament we also see men like Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, who were used by God to speak for Him in their work
They were more than just mouthpieces for God; they were slightly more advanced than Balaam or some of the other prophets
He spoke according to the instructions of God, but in a sense his speaking was in the same principle as Balaam's speaking
In principle, however, they were the same as the Old Testament prophets who spoke only when God's word came upon them
In Him, God's word was released in an entirely different way than it was released through the Old Testament prophets
When the Lord Jesus came, the word no longer came upon a man, with the word remaining the word and the man remaining man
As soon as human feelings, thoughts, and opinions were added to God's word, it was no longer God's perfect, pure, and unadulterated word
The purity of God's word could only be maintained when it was not contaminated with any human feelings, thoughts, or opinions
When Balaam put in his own feelings and opinions, the word was no longer just God's word; God's word was altered
Man's thought became God's thought, man's feeling became God's feeling, and man's opinion became God's opinion
The Lord Jesus served as a minister of the word under an entirely different principle from the Old Testament ministers
God is not satisfied with the word alone; He wants His word to be a personified word that carries human feelings, thoughts, and opinions
In the Lord Jesus we find that when the Word became flesh, the thought of that flesh became the thought of God
There is one kind of human thought which, when added to God's word, does not contaminate it but instead completes it
At the time of the prophets in the Old Testament we could only point to the prophets when they opened their mouths and say Here is Gods word
He did not need God's word to come to Him externally before He spoke the divine word, because His very speaking was God's speaking
In the Old Testament the ministry of the word was realized when the word came upon a man and the man's voice was used as a carrier
In the Lord Jesus the ministry of the word was not through the visitation of the word but through the embodiment of the word as a man
Everything that belonged to this man was being employed by the word, because every aspect of this man was in harmony with God's word
In order for this flesh to become a minister of the word, it has to be transformed to match the requirement of God's word
We can say that the New Testament ministry of the word is different from both its Old Testament counterpart and from the Lord's ministry
The New Testament ministry, on the other hand, is the ministry of the prophets plus the ministry of the Lord Jesus
Men chosen by God in the New Testament are different from the Lord Jesus, who is God's 'holy thing' and God's Holy One
In addition to depositing His word into their being, God had to deal with the persons themselves; He had to build them up
God dealt with the New Testament ministers of the word in their experience, speaking, feeling, thoughts, opinions, and characteristics
Although the human elements in the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament were minimal, one cannot say that they were completely absent
Today in the New Testament age, God secures ministers of His word by expressing His word through human beings with human elements
The Gospel of Matthew is different from the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Mark is different from the Gospel of Luke or the Gospel of John
The book of Revelation, which was also written by John, echoes his Gospel and Epistles and contains the same style
Every book of the Bible is impregnated with the marks of its writer, yet every book remains very much the word of God
Every writer has his own style, expression, and characteristic, and God uses these characteristics to express His word through them
In the New Testament ministry God entrusts His word to man, and He uses man's very own elements to express His word
Paul did not encourage everyone to speak in tongues in the meeting, because when a man speaks in tongues, his mind is unfruitful
By the restriction regulation and operation of the Holy Spirit everything of man can be used by God and God can release His word through man
Every instrument is different, yet all the characteristics added together bring out the sentiments and ethos of the music
Under the regulation, direction, and perfection of the Holy Spirit, the human elements do not become a hindrance to God's word
The outstanding characteristic of the New Testament, from the first page to the last, is that it is a record of man's speaking
When God's word came to him, he was filled with affliction and anguish of heart, and he wrote through many tears
He was not like a tongue-speaker, who receives a word and passes it on without the mind having any effect upon the word itself
As such, man's characteristics, idiomatic expressions, tone of voice, and subjective experiences before God all flow through the word
Through the word we can find the extent to which a man has been taught by God, disciplined by God, and tested by God
A New Testament minister of the word is one who has been taught by God for many years and one whom God can freely use
The divine word will suffer contamination only if the human elements which interact with God's word are fleshly or natural
God is not satisfied with having His word alone; He wants His word to become flesh, to become part of man's word
If a man makes a mistake or if he introduces unclean elements into his speaking, God's word will be contaminated and will suffer loss
We must realize that the critical factor in speaking God's word is not the amount of Bible knowledge one possesses
As ministers of the word, we should realize that God's word is expressed through our flesh; He needs our flesh
If we are short in any way, God's word will be damaged as soon as it passes through us and mingles with our own words
We can see this in Paul, Peter, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and we can see this in many servants of the Lord
If man can invent a tape recorder, God certainly can create something in the universe which would faithfully convey His word verbatim
If God were to convey His word to man this way, there would be no possibility of mistakes; everyone could hear God's pure word
If God had intended to use angels as His messengers, He could have dictated His words as ordinances, like the Ten Commandments
They think that if God's word were to be spelled out line after line, man would have no problem understanding it
When a man picked up such a Bible, he would have a manual of Christianity, which would tell him all about Christianity at a glance
The basic problem with such a word is that it does not carry any human element with it, and only God could fully understand it
Even though the word would be of God, there would be no ground for mutual communication; there would be no connection between God and man
If God's word does not contain human characteristics, it would be the same as thunder to us; we would not know what it meant
From Abel's sacrifice in Genesis to the book of Leviticus with its many offerings, we find men offering sacrifices to God again and again
He prepared materials for God's house, and Solomon built the temple with the gold, silver, and precious stones that David had prepared
If the stories of Moses and Joshua were taken away, there would be very little left of the books of Exodus, Numbers, and Joshua
The book of Acts provides very little doctrine; it is primarily a record of the acts of the apostles under the leading of the Holy Spirit
We have to remember that the incarnation of the Lord Jesus unveils the basic principle of the ministry of God's word
Today, however, holiness is no longer abstract, because we can see holiness lived out on earth in the Lord Jesus
When the word became flesh, glory became flesh, love became flesh, and longsuffering and holiness became flesh
Since God's word is full of human elements, God cannot use a tape recorder, thunder, lightning, or angels to communicate His word
If we receive a word from God and send out the same word verbatim, we are acting merely as a recording machine
He wants us to receive the word and then dwell on it, feel it, be bothered by it, rejoice over it, and chew on it before sending it out
John 737 says Now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out saying If anyone thirsts let him come to Me and drink
The ministry of the word is God's word coming into us and then flowing out from our innermost being to quench others' thirst
The need for a turning within our innermost being and a subsequent flowing out from within our inner being tells us that a price is involved
Does the word become human while still being divine, or do we damage God's word when our human elements are added to it?
A big problem with many people is that the living water ceases to be living when it passes through their innermost being!
If a man thinks that being a minister of the word is merely a matter of eloquence and cleverness, he is far from the truth!
God's word must first come to us, pass through us, fill us, and even bother us, grind us, rub us, and deal with us
We must first suffer these trials and pay this price before we can be brought to the clear realization of God's word
When the Holy Spirit works on us breaks us dismantles us and molds us we are formed into a channel through which the living water can flow
Our outer man has to be broken and dismantled by God; it needs to be thoroughly and drastically dealt with by God
It is not the independent release of God's Spirit in His word but the release of His Spirit in His word in conjunction with man
Some people think that they can successfully transmit God's word as long as they pick up a few phrases here and there
God does not operate this way, because this is a fundamental contradiction to the principle of the ministry of the word
God's ordained way is to put His word first into ministers, those who have experienced the dealings of the Holy Spirit
The seven sons of Sceva tried to cast out demons in the name of the Jesus whom Paul preached, but they could not cast them out
Some speak about the cross on the platform, but others can sense that they have never passed through any dealings
The church is desolate, poor, and in ruin because human elements have not come up to the standard of God's word
If God can find a person who has been dealt with by Him, who is broken, and who is prostrate on his face, God's word will flow through him
If the Holy Spirit is locked within us, the hindrance and frustration is our outer man, our emotion, and our temperament
Even if we deliver a wonderful sermon, in reality it is nothing but words, teachings, and doctrines; there is not the word of God
If our emotion is misaligned if our mind is impaired or if our understanding heart and spirit are even slightly off we will damage Gods word
He made provisions long ago for our natural abilities and experiences, and He has prepared us for our future commission
Paul's ministry was in the principle of tentmaking; he put material together and built it into a habitable dwelling
We do not know how much of what we have in us is permitted to stay and how much is hated by God and in need of being broken
As soon as we function in our ministry, whoever has been taught by God will have an inner registration of a pure or a defiled service
The cross has removed everything that God condemns and hates, and it has broken down everything that needs to be broken down
Let us turn our attention to Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians, in particular to the manner in which he fulfilled his ministry of the word
On the one hand, Paul charged, and on the other hand, he said that it was not his charge but the Lord's charge
He does not act in a certain way because he comes to a separate realization of God's desire in a certain matter
We must remember that something is given to us by the Lord on the one hand, while God is beating the same thing into us on the other hand
When God's word is placed in such a man and he is called to be a minister of the word, there is no danger of corruption
Ministry of the word means that there is not only the word but the man, the very person who serves as the minister of the word
A minister of the word is one who is so constituted by God that God can entrust him with His very opinions, thoughts, and desires
We are not admitting every kind of human element; we are saying that only certain kinds of human elements can be involved in God's word
Paul could say 'I wish,' 'I say,' or 'I direct in all the churches' because he was a person who had met God; he knew God
We have to remember that God's word is not released in a supernatural way; it is released through man and with human elements
The less one receives and learns from the Lord, the more likely God's word is defiled and contaminated when it is released through him
The more restriction, discipline, blows, and breakings one receives, the purer God's word is when it is released through him
Let us turn to 1 Corinthians 14:29-32, which says, 'And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern
Although the first one may have God's word in his mouth, he should stop and allow others who have received a revelation to speak
When the Holy Spirit is upon a person and he is serving as God's minister of the word, the spirit of such a person is subject to him
The time and way for the word to be delivered is entirely the responsibility of the prophets; they are not the responsibility of the Spirit
If a prophet has not experienced the proper dealings, discipline, and restriction, his spirit will run wild, and trouble will result
Without God's word, there is no ministry of the word, and without a proper person, there is also no ministry of the word
If your spirit is not proper, you will give others the impression of an improper spirit even though all of your words may be correct
The more we are dealt with by the Lord and the deeper His dealing touches our being, the closer we are to having a revelation
When the word is put into the mouth of such a person, the resulting ministry of the word is a revelation, an inspiration
We should never have the mistaken thought that human wisdom, knowledge, or eloquence can add anything to God's word
We have preached the word for more than ten or twenty years, but how much of what we have preached has been the utterance of God's word?
Today God does not speak directly to man, the heavens do not speak directly to man, and the angels do not speak directly to man
If the church will stand on new ground and if it will satisfy God to become His vessel Gods word will once again be released in a mighty way
Besides the Lord Jesus, who is the very Word of God becoming flesh, there are two kinds of ministers in the ministry of the word
In principle, the Old Testament ministers were completely objective in nature; they did not have any subjective experience of their own
With this kind of speaking, the only thing that was required to preserve God's revelation was for man to be accurate
If a New Testament minister matches God's goal, his ministry is more glorious than that of the Old Testament ministers
He places it before man and allows man to deliver it according to his own thoughts, feelings, understanding, memory, and words
If man delivers the word in a pure way, this ministry is many times more glorious than the Old Testament ministry
If God had done this, there would have been no danger of sinning, and God would have spared Himself the trouble of redemption
He desires a people who can discern the left from the right, who can choose good as well as evil, right as well as wrong
If the creature created by God chooses submission to God of his own volition his choice gives God more glory than the obedience of a machine
Even using a donkey poses less of a problem than speaking through man because a donkey is not as complicated as a man
If the release of God's word were merely a matter of man repeating God's utterances word for word, such a task would be easy
The New Testament ministry of the word is not one in which God dictates His message word by word and then man repeats it word for word
He may write down the phrase, or he may have a certain feeling, judgment, or opinion concerning a certain matter, and he may speak it out
God wants to operate in man to such an extent that man is like Him in his opinions, thoughts, feelings, and views
Paul was saying that even though he agreed with the proposition, the matter did not originate from him as a command
When we were on the subject of God's authority, we pointed out the tremendous significance of the Lord Jesus entrusting His name to us
His intention is to put His word into us, that is, for us to take it in as living water and then to let it flow out of us
It is as if the God of heaven has commissioned us to speak for Him on earth, yet the same God allows us to say whatever we want to say
If his mind, feelings, opinions, and judgments are untrustworthy or if his heart and his spirit are unreliable, his words will be unreliable
While these feelings certainly belong to him and are independent of outside influence, they are attached to God at the same time
He had received mercy from God and had been in touch with spiritual things and had handled similar matters repeatedly in the past
We must realize that the Spirit of God not only resides in man but is doing an engraving and constituting work in man
Paul did not serve as a minister of God's word merely because he afforded the Spirit the freedom to speak through him
The character fully belongs to man yet at the same time it is fully begotten of the Holy Spirit it is the result of the Spirits work in man
Philippians 3 speaks of one kind of fundamental experience, and 2 Corinthians 3 speaks of another kind of fundamental experience
It is unthinkable that the Lord could dwell in a man, being his life for ten or twenty years, yet the man would remain unchanged
When the Lord's Spirit abides in us and becomes our life, our mind, feelings, judgments, and opinions all have to change
There is a new constitution and new fruit in our feelings, thoughts, and judgments, as well as in our heart and spirit
When a man speaks under the constitution of the Holy Spirit, he may not have the consciousness that God is speaking
Because the constitution of the Holy Spirit has been wrought into him, his words become the words of the Holy Spirit
We need Him to work on us to the extent that our opinions, words, thoughts, and feelings no longer contradict God's word
When a man submits to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he is given the freedom to express his characteristics
Those who have been taught by God know that the Spirit's love as manifested in Paul was different from that which was manifested in John
We know that the book of Colossians is very high, but 1 Corinthians 7 tells us about the person who wrote Colossians
Romans contains a clear exposition of the gospel, but 1 Corinthians 7 tells us about the person who wrote Romans
He cannot acknowledge them as ministers of the word because their thoughts, feelings, opinions, and words are not trustworthy
If we only had his other Epistles, without having 1 Corinthians 7, we would not know the kind of person Paul was
Paul's personality and idiomatic expressions all contributed to God's word; they made the latter more glorious and rich
May all the brothers see that there is a pathway that must be followed in order to be a minister of God's word
Neither does He have the intention of removing the teaching ministry or the evangelistic ministry from the church
When we talk about the ministry of God's word, we are not saying that God has other words unrelated to the Bible
At the same time we have to realize that a knowledge of the Bible alone does not qualify one to preach God's word
Each writer used his own special terminology, and his writing contained his own feelings, thoughts, and human elements
Following Joshua, other writers, such as the authors of the books of Samuel, also based their writings on Moses' books
If one reads through it, he will find that many things in the New Testament were actually spoken first in the Old Testament
Other passages are not direct quotations, yet the writers clearly make references to passages in the Old Testament
We have to remember that the ministry of the word in the New Testament is based on the divine utterance in the Old Testament
God's prophecy cannot be interpreted just according to its immediate context; it cannot be interpreted from just the passage itself
None of the Bible can be privately interpreted; it cannot be interpreted according to the immediate text alone
Today we have the Bible before us; we cannot release any independent so-called 'word of God' which is unrelated to God's established Word
When the third group comes along, it should build its speaking upon the first and second groups; it cannot speak independently either
God may give new visions and new revelations, but these visions and revelations are based on words that He has already spoken
From one revelation more light developed; men's eyes were opened more and more, until we have both the Old Testament and the New Testament
A person becomes a New Testament minister of God's word by receiving visions of God's word in the Old Testament
A minister of God's word today is not independent, just as the ministers of His word in the former days were not independent
Anyone who receives a revelation apart from the Bible is receiving heresy, something which is absolutely unacceptable
In reading God's Word, can we find the Old Testament contradicting the New Testament or the law contradicting grace?
They think that the Old Testament and the New contradict each other because God appears to men differently under the law and under grace
In other words, God preached the gospel to Abraham and told him to wait for Christ, through whom blessing would come upon the whole world
In Galatians Paul says that our gospel is based on Abraham's gospel and that our grace is based on the grace that Abraham received
The promise we have received is based on the promise given to Abraham, and the Christ we have received is the very seed of Abraham
Galatians shows us that the grace we receive today is not without precedence; it is the same grace that God gave to Abraham
The beginning promise, the intervening law, and the accomplishment of Christ's gospel today are all along the same line
It is clear that the ministers of the word who wrote the New Testament were acquainted and familiar with the Old Testament
It is also clear that today's ministers must also be well acquainted with the Old Testament and the New Testament
Only then can our words match those of the Old and the New Testaments; only then will our speaking not be independent speakings
The ministry of the word today is not a matter of receiving some independent words from God and speaking such words to men
When the first group of men stood up to speak God's word, they did not have any spoken word from God to serve as their basis
When the second group of ministers was raised up, they could only quote as much of the Scripture as the first group had released
All of the words of the Old Testament have been released, and all of the words of the New Testament have been released
If our word does not match that of the Old Testament and the New Testament, we can know with certainty that we are off
If he is not familiar with the whole Bible, he cannot apply it at will, and he cannot be a minister of God's word
Today all of God's progressive words and progressive revelations are based upon His spoken words and revealed revelations
Ephesians 1 tells us that the Lord Jesus ascended to the height and is seated at the right hand of God the Father
Chapter four tells us that in His ascension, the Lord Jesus led captive those who were taken captive by His enemy and gave gifts to men
If a man does not understand the Old Testament sacrifices, he will not understand how the Lord Jesus offered Himself as a sacrifice
In other words, God's light is contained in Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, and Solomon
Take for example Galatians 3:6, which says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness'
In Galatians 3, Paul quoted the same passage again, but this time the emphasis was not on accounting but on believing
When James spoke of this passage, his emphasis was neither on accounting nor on believing, but on righteousness
In the New Testament, this light is released through the same verse, once here, once there, and once in another place
The present-day word is contained in the New Testament words, just as the New Testament words are contained in the Old Testament words
The basic principle today is to receive the word through the Word and to build words upon the words of the Bible
We should go to God's Word according to the pattern of the apostles, not according to the fashion of the scribes and Pharisees
If a man goes beyond the boundary of God's established, spoken Word in his speaking, his speaking is heretical and devilish
Anything that comes from the Bible is right; anything that does not come from the Bible, but from other sources, is wrong
The ministry of the word must not just have God's word as its foundation; God Himself must open and explain this word as well
Neither can a person claim to be a messenger of God's word simply because he has equipped himself with God's previous speakings
In the same way, this does not mean that a person who is familiar with the New Testament can be a minister of the word today
There were many scribes and Pharisees who were very familiar with the Old Testament, but none were ministers of the word
Today some people may have studied the Bible very thoroughly, but this does not mean that they are ministers of the word
Ministers of the word are those who are familiar with God's Word and those to whom God has also explained and opened up the Word
Matthew 123 is a quotation of Isaiah 7 Behold the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son and they shall call His name Emmanuel
In reading Jeremiah 31:15 we would not have the thought that this refers to Herod's intention to kill the Lord Jesus
Without the interpretation of the Holy Spirit, the Word is closed to us and, as such, can never become the basis of our speaking
A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory
Matthew did not serve as a minister of the word capriciously; his speaking was based on the writings of the Old Testament
There are many quotations from the Old Testament in the book of Matthew, not a few of which were made by the Lord Jesus Himself
The Holy Spirit opened up to Paul the fact of Abraham's begetting of Isaac, and he was able to see its significance
He does not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ'
If that were the case, God's grace would have been for the Jews only; only they could bring blessing to the whole world
Based on this Paul showed us that God does not justify man according to his righteousness but according to his faith
Paul went on to show us that all of Abraham's descendants are justified the same way that Abraham was justified
Paul shows that Genesis 15 speaks not only of a fact or of history but of a principle, the principle of justification by faith
Some people think that the prophecies, ordinances, and teachings in the Bible are valuable but that the history is not
We must remember that all historical records in the Bible are part of God's word, in the same way that the teachings are God's word
We know that the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament are God's word, and so are the teachings, the ordinances, and even the history
Prophecies require interpretation by the Holy Spirit, and the history also requires interpretation by the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit has to interpret the facts in the Old Testament to us before we can have the ministry of the word
On that day all one hundred twenty men and women received the outpouring of Gods Spirit they were filled as if they were drunk with new wine
Peter not only explained to the people what was happening that day; he also testified to them and exhorted them to receive the same thing
If you want to give a message on various kinds of worship apart from God, you can combine these passages and speak something concerning them
While Peter was serving as a minister of God's word that day, the Holy Spirit interpreted these three passages of the Scripture to him
While he preached in Pisidian Antioch, he quoted from 1 Samuel 13, Psalm 89, Psalm 2, Isaiah 55, Psalm 16, and Habakkuk
Based on this synthesis, Paul came to a conclusion and challenged the audience to accept Jesus of Nazareth as their Savior
As the New Testament ministers read God's Old Testament word, they received three different kinds of interpretation from the Holy Spirit
We have to remember that the ministry of the word today is far richer than the ministry of the word seen in the writers of the New Testament
The basis of the divine word upon which we speak is the Old Testament writings plus Paul's, Peter's, and others' writings
In regard to the operation of the Holy Spirit the work of constitution is always inward while the experience of the gifts is always outward
We also must see the accuracy of the New Testament, and we should also give ground to the Lord Spirit's interpretation
We need to study the Bible, but it is not enough just to study the Bible; we need the interpretation of the Holy Spirit
A minister of the word does not receive an isolated, unrelated, great, and unprecedented revelation all at once
There were other men before Paul, and before us there are Paul, the apostles, and the sixty-six books of the Bible, God's written Word
Today's revelation must match that of our predecessors, and today's light and word must match that of our forebearers
God's word is handed down from generation to generation, and His word also begets more of the word from generation to generation
With the first person, God had to intervene directly, but the second person treads on the pathway of the first and sees more
In order to see more and receive more, we have to see what our predecessors have seen and receive what they have received
Generation after generation, many men have acted as ministers, but all these ministers came out of the same one word
Only then will they be linked up with God's great 'word,' and only then will they be able to stand together with all ministers of God
He must have revelation concerning God's Word and must possess the anointing of the Spirit concerning this Word
One outstanding characteristic of this book is that it is made up of words spoken by men, yet it is God's word in every sense
The word used in 2 Timothy 3:16, which is translated as inspiration by some versions, is breath according to the original language
When many people read this book, they touch only the human elements and words; they do not sense God's speaking in this book
As far as its outward shell is concerned, it was written from man's memory and can be retained in man's memory
A minister of God's word serves the church not by touching the physical dimension of the Bible but by touching the spiritual dimension of it
If the Bible did not have a physical side, a man would either be a minister of God's word or not; there could be no mistake about it
Man can preach the human elements in the Bible by the power of his own human faculties, and he can presume that he is a minister of the word
He can present all the human elements in the Bible to the church, and he can presume that he is serving the church with God's word
He can presume that the truths he preaches are scriptural truths and that they are teachings that conform to the orthodox and pure faith
We have to realize that these teachings have nothing to do with the spiritual aspect of the Bible; they are of another realm
We should never have the misconception that the more we study God's word, the more we can be a minister of His word
The written word, including all the biblical doctrines, knowledge, teachings, prophecies, and truths, is in this realm
When Paul delivered this Epistle to the Romans, they might have been impressed with only the letter of the Epistle
If this were the case, it would only be a letter and nothing else; there would not be God's word in it for them
He could only touch the doctrine of the Bible the content of the Bible and the surface of Gods word he could not touch the life in His word
Today when we read the book of Romans, we may only touch the surface of the Bible, the physical and outward side of it
Today God has to breathe His breath upon this word once again before we can know God's word and before we can be a minister to Him
Revelation means God is doing something today; He is reviving today what He once gave to man through inspiration
It is when God's Spirit revives His word in such a way that it becomes as living and full of life as when Paul wrote it
If a man does not have revelation, he can study every word from the first page to the last without hearing a single word from God
We need to hear the doctrine and the teaching, but in addition to hearing these things, we need to hear something else
He hears God's speaking in addition to hearing the teaching, and he bows his head and confesses, 'I am a sinner
The other ninety-nine have only touched things related to the human and physical aspect of the word; they have not heard God's word
Since you are speaking the same words that were so full of anointing you think that the Holy Spirit will surely continue to anoint your word
The Holy Spirit may have anointed your word at one time, but this does not mean that He will anoint it whenever you speak the same thing
We have to see the relationship between the ministry of the word and the Scriptures, or the relationship between the Bible and the word
We may be in the same room and quote the same verse, but the Holy Spirit may not speak, and the second person may not be saved
It is not how much of the Scriptures we understand, how many biblical truths we have seen, or how many verses we can quote
He has to use the same word again today; His anointing has to be upon the same word before it will become effective to us
It is the same word, because without that word as the basis, God cannot speak; there is no disagreement in His speaking
You can repeat the same words, the same doctrines, the same testimonies, the same parables, and the same expressions
The daughter of Jairus was resurrected, the only son of the widow of Nain was resurrected, and Lazarus was resurrected
God is putting His life into His word once more, and when this word becomes living in man, it is revelation to man
Life has to enter the word again and again, revelation has to come upon it again and again, and light has to shine upon it again and again
Anyone who tries to reject the Bible is rejected by God because he is rejecting the words that God has written down
With the words of the Scriptures, there is still the need for man to go to God to receive revelation and light
The rod remains the same, but fresh life has to enter it once more before it will sprout, blossom, and bear fruit
Whenever a man tries to explain the Bible without the anointing, revelation, or light, the ministry of the word stops in him
The more you learn to speak according to your spirit, the more you will realize that this is something that is beyond anyone's control
The words can be the same the sounds can be the same and even the inward feelings can be the same but what is released will not be the same
The problem today is that many young brothers and sisters cannot tell the difference between gifts and ministry
The two may be the same in letters, in outward appearance, but those who have the discernment can tell the difference between them
In looking back at church history, we find that God has been taking the way of recovery from the time of Martin Luther
It does not mean that we have the revelation of the New Testament once we preach the truth of the New Testament
We must realize that the responsibility of the ministers of the word is to allow God to speak through the Scripture once again
They are those who open the Bible and convey to their audience the words of God's present speaking, not just the words from the book itself
If the hearers have a problem in themselves, or if they choose to shut up their spirits, hearts, or minds, that is their own concern
We should never think that we can call ourselves successors to the apostles just as long as we preach the same Scripture that they preached
In the church nothing is more serious than the absence of men who supply others with God's word, revelation, and light
By asking them to pray for these things by themselves, we are shirking our responsibility and casting the burden on their shoulders
A minister of the word should prepare God's word in such a way that he can minister and feed others with the word
The whole problem lies in the fact that we are closed to God; we have refused to allow God's light to shine on us
While they are expounding the Bible, they do not have the faintest hope or thought that God would speak through them
They are interested only in their own truth, their own pet ideas, and they think that as long as these can be propagated, all will be well
Brothers, we have to realize how different the exposition of the Scripture is from the impartation of God's revelation to man
We must realize that even though we may say many words that sound reasonable, wonderful, nice, and precious, God is not in our speaking
Once we become professional preachers, we will speak because it is our job to speak, and we will preach because it is our job to preach
The words themselves do not convey burning light; the revelation is not strong enough to knock men to the ground
The Bible is not merely a book; it is not merely pages of writings from which men receive doctrines and teachings
If a person remains in the first realm, all he has is the book, and he cannot serve as a minister of God's word
In other words, we do not know Him as the Jesus of Nazareth who walked on the earth, that is, the historical Jesus
He knew the historical Jesus, the Jesus from Nazareth, but he did not realize that this Jesus of Nazareth was God
It takes God's Spirit to open men's eyes before they can recognize this Jesus as the Son of God and the Christ
When a man recognizes that the historical Jesus is God's Christ and Son, this seeing becomes the foundation upon which the church is built
Even if these ones had been able to live, walk, and work together with the Lord Jesus every day, they still would not have known Him
We need God to open our eyes before we can recognize Jesus of Nazareth as being the Word of God and the Son of God
In the same way, God has to open our eyes before we will recognize the Bible as being the word of God and a revelation of His Son
In the same way, those who are acquainted with the Bible and who have read and studied it for many years do not necessarily know the Bible
The disciples complained about the crowd that was pressing upon Him all around and wondered how the Lord could even ask who was touching Him
Today, even if the Lord were to stand right next to you, He would do you no good if you were only pressing upon Him
A minister of the word is one who, while serving others with the word of God, also serves them with the Son of God
When many people read the Bible, they only see the historical Jesus; they have never touched the Son of God within the Bible
When they were near Emmaus, they constrained Him, saying, 'Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by'
Walking with Him, talking with Him, and having Him expound the Scripture to us are not enough to guarantee that we will know Him
We have to realize that the Lord the disciples knew in their spirit is no different from the Lord we know in our spirit today
If we do not have revelation, we may read the book but only have knowledge of doctrines; we will not know the Christ contained in the book
The amazing thing is that the Lord did not feel anyone pressing upon Him, but He was very conscious of someone touching Him
Later He told the Jews that the truth would set them free and that they did not have to remain slaves but could be free instead
The Lord Jesus said that those who are of God hear God's words but that the others did not hear because they were not of God
Some people are all the time touching the outward shell of the Bible; they think that they are ministers of God's word
Today inspiration must be complemented by revelation before it can become God's speaking; inspiration alone is not enough
The Bible is God's inspiration, but it must be complemented by revelation before it can be called God's speaking
If all we have is inspiration, we do not have God's speaking; instead, we only have the outward shell of the word
What makes God's word so special is that the natural ear, the ear of flesh, can hear His word and yet this hearing does not count
The strange thing is that John said only those who knew God would hear him; those who were not of God could not hear him
We must be very clear about this principle: God is Spirit and those who worship Him must do so with their spirit
For whoever has it shall be given to him and he will abound but whoever does not have even that which he has shall be taken away from him
He answered, 'Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given'
They would hear that an enemy came in to sow tares while the man slept, but they would not know what the tares meant
They would hear that a woman took leaven and hid it in three measures of flour but would not know what the leaven meant
The Lord intentionally used the parables to keep them in the outward realm without understanding what the words really meant
They only heard the outward letter of things such as the sowing the wheat the tares the net and the leaven they did not know what they meant
Many people today read the Bible in the same way that the Jews listened to the parables; they only know that the sower went out to sow
They only know about the good ground, the thorny ground, the shallow and stony ground, and the thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold return
If we do not touch the very thing behind the word, we can say all we want to others, but we will have nothing to minister to them
Once a man lives before God and finds out what the Lord is like, he will spontaneously find the same thing in the Bible
He will readily be able to relate a passage to something he sees in the Lord or to something the Lord has expressed through him
We will only be able to minister the Bible to the church; we will not be able to minister Christ to the church
We must remember that leading people to a knowledge of the Bible and leading them to a knowledge of Christ are two entirely different things
The latter is based on first receiving a revelation, a vision, or some kind of knowledge before God and then learning what the Bible says
We admit that many exegeses are useful, and that these exegeses can save a young, inexperienced person from many errors and frustrations
When a man lives before God, knows the Lord, and knows Christ, he can pick up a passage here and a passage there
At the beginning the Lord reveals Himself to you and shows you what He is; you see something which you have not seen in the Bible
We need the word that belongs to the outer realm, and we need to touch the word that belongs to the inner realm
May the Lord be merciful to us, and may we see that God's word is Christ, just as Jesus of Nazareth was Christ
We have to touch the Bible through the Lord, and our service in the ministry of the word must be based on this
He is a man to whom God has chosen to reveal His Son; he has a basic revelation that enables him to know who Jesus of Nazareth is
When a man has seen the Son of God, all holiness, righteousness, light, and life pass away under such a vision, and only Christ remains
In order to serve, to minister Christ to others, and to supply others with Christ, a man must have the revelation of Christ
Since the day of Paul and Peter, everyone who has a ministry of the word before God has had a fundamental revelation of Christ
A man must be brought on by God to the point where he knows God's Son face to face in the deepest part of his being
A man can say with his mouth that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and the Anointed One through reading the Bible
A man can understand something about Christ through studying the Bible, but this does not mean that he has the revelation
When God grants us mercy and reveals His Son in us, we will say spontaneously and effortlessly, 'Thank God, He is everything
Now if you point out a cow to him in the book and tell him that it is called a cow, he will readily understand
When we read the Bible again, everything will be clear and obvious to us; we will see everything through the light of this book
From that time forward, day by day as you read the Bible, you will find passage after passage making sense to you
Once you have the subjective knowledge, you will find God's word understandable and self-harmonizing when you study it again
What were problems to you now become meaningful revelations, and what was once insignificant now becomes very significant
You may not see everything all at once, but it will appear to you little by little, and you will see more as the days go by
They could tell others about the teachings and doctrines of the Scripture, but they kept Christ outside the door
Throughout this book, from Genesis 1 to Malachi 4, they found that this Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, the very Christ
Although Paul was a good and pious Pharisee, and although he knew the Scripture very well, he persecuted those who were of the Way
Paul did not study the Scripture and then suddenly realize one day through his study that Jesus is the Son of God
As soon as God flashed His light on him, he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
After he received this revelation, what do we learn of Paul in the rest of the book of Acts and in the Epistles?
Only after we have known Christ will we know the Bible, and only then will we be able to serve as a minister of the word
But Saul was all the more empowered, and he confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus by proving that this One is the Christ'
If you want to be an oracle of the Lord's word, you need a thorough and powerful shining to realize that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God
Such a realization will humble you; it will cause you to forget about everything and to have a one-hundred-eighty-degree turn
Once you know the Lord this way, the Bible will become a new and open book to you, and you will understand this book
The Lord said that Peter's knowledge was not revealed to him by flesh and blood but by the Father who is in the heavens
The gates of Hades will not prevail against the church because the foundation of the church is Christ; this foundation is the Son of God
Our knowledge of Him comes from a revelation that is beyond flesh and blood; it comes from the Father who is in the heavens
A revelation concerning Christ was not only crucial to Peter, to Paul, to John, and to Matthew, but to the whole church today as well
Anyone who wants to be a minister of the word needs to experience what Peter, Matthew, John, and Paul experienced at the beginning
There is something special about them: They were all humbled by the Lord at one time, and they now know something
Please remember that the basis of the ministry of the word is the knowledge of Christ, not a good knowledge of the Bible
We are merely saying that a man who does not know Christ and who is just touching the Bible outwardly does not have the ministry of the word
In the end the Holy Spirit translates the words of the Bible back into Christ within those who have received the word
Having familiarized himself with the Bible, he can speak with assurance concerning a certain passage, a certain story, or a certain teaching
We should note that there is a world of difference between having and not having this translation process going on behind the word
Those who have a fundamental knowledge of Christ put this Christ into the words of the Bible and release them to others
We are responsible for putting the Christ we know, gain, and see into words and presenting these words to others
When the word is released from his mouth, the Holy Spirit works, Christ is realized and known, and the church receives the benefit
For them a messages begins with the Scripture and ends with the Scripture, and it stops where the Scripture stops
When a minister of the word stands up to speak, one finds God's Christ and God's Son through the words he utters
We can tell others about the words of the Bible, but we cannot tell them about God's Word, which is Christ Himself
When God chooses us to be a minister of the word, we find out that as we are speaking from this book, we are speaking about this man
When we convey the words of this book to others, we are conveying His person as well; we are conveying Christ to others
What we need is to minister Christ as a minister of the word before God so that others touch Christ when they touch the words we speak
There is a danger: If a man does not have an ear and tongue of 'an instructed one' , he will project himself into God's word
There is a need not only for the breaking work of the Holy Spirit but also for the constituting work of the Spirit in us
In the case of Paul, the Holy Spirit constituted Christ into him so that he became different from his unregenerated condition
His human elements had been so thoroughly dealt with by the Lord that their addition to God's word did not contaminate it
The Holy Spirit can work in a man to such an extent that when he stands up to speak, others realize that the Lord is speaking
God does not speak additional words or independent words anymore; He speaks through what He has already spoken
In order for a man to be a minister of the word, he cannot base his speaking on God's Word alone, that is, on the Bible alone
He must have a fundamental revelation from God before he can serve as a minister of the word through the existing written words of the Bible
After receiving such a revelation, we will find what we have already seen of the Lord whenever we open up the Bible
We must first prostrate ourselves before the Lord and acknowledge that none of what we knew before could stand before Him
When he was enlightened and smitten to the ground, he realized that what he had done was a persecution of the Lord, not a service to Him
The amazing thing is that once a person meets the Lord and is enlightened, the Bible immediately becomes a new book to him
We must have the basic revelation first, before our person, our spirit, and our knowledge of the Lord and of the Bible can be useful
When God wants us to speak something, we have to learn to receive a fresh revelation that pertains to that particular speaking
It is useless for a person to prepare a number of sermons and then try to use them when occasions call for them
We may speak the same thing again, but afterward, we feel that something is wrong, that what we said was not the right thing
We feel that we are, in fact, quite far from the thing that we were speaking about; we do not touch that thing at all
We may be able to speak, and others may appreciate our speaking, but we can be our own judge; within we know that something is wrong
It is possible that on this particular day, no one else has that word; only this brother knows this word because he has the revelation
Ministry of the word does not depend on the words we have spoken in the past, but on the new revelation we have acquired in the present
They think that if they repeat the same message again and again, they will have the same result again and again
Even if a person spoke Paul's or John's very own messages, it would not work, to say nothing of repeating his own message
We know that the ministry of the prophets involves things for today and the future; it does not involve things of the past
Nathan primarily expressed God's thought; he was expressing God's heart concerning certain things that were happening then
In the Old Testament the highest expression of the ministry of God's word was the prophesying and preaching of the prophets
In this realm a man only needs to convey to others what he has learned from school, books, and Bible expositors
Some brothers commit the fundamental blunder of regarding eloquence and intelligence as qualifications for a good message
A listener with a good memory may retain a message for a few days, but after that time, the message goes away and nothing remains
A man can listen to our messages, but our word does not result in any condemnation of evil, the flesh, or the carnal man in him
Words from one realm can only produce fruits from that realm; they do not produce fruits from a different realm
If a person has received revelation once and is continually receiving revelations, he imparts revelation to others as he speaks
We can pass on doctrines to others, but in order to be a minister of the word, we have to have the revelation of the Holy Spirit
The ministry of the word is something that belongs to a different realm, a realm that has nothing to do with ourselves
Many people can tell stories, and they can preach doctrines, but they may not be able to tell you what God's word is
The Lord has to deal with us and with our work to such an extent that we bow down and say, 'Lord, do Your own work
We must see that ministry is based on the revelation of the word, and the revelation of the word is based on the revelation of Christ
No one can boast about what he has, and no one should imagine that he can keep on working with what he has in his hands
Ministry of the word results in a state in which a man becomes as empty as a newborn babe as soon as the word is released
He knows nothing before God, and he looks to God for another filling and another infusion of the word and revelation
To take up God's word and to serve as a minister of this word is a task that is beyond any human power to achieve
On the one hand, we are very clear within, but on the other hand, we do not have the assurance that we are clear at all
A man can remember many things, but it is hard to remember light, and what he remembers may not be what he has seen
Many brothers have remarked, 'The more we read the writings of those with revelation, the more we tend to forget them'
He may not remember anything of the content of what he has seen, other than the fact that he has seen something
Sometimes this light shines into a persons spirit directly without passing through any other means and its shining goes on in a dynamic way
Most of the time he receives the shining directly in his spirit, but occasionally he receives some shining when he is reading the Bible
If a man has been dealt with by the Lord and his outward man is broken and torn down, he will spontaneously be enriched in his thoughts
If we do not have thoughts, we do not know the meaning of the light, and we do not know the content of the light
When our thoughts are strong, we capture the light, and we are able to translate it into intelligible thoughts for ourselves
Before light is transformed into thoughts, we cannot remember what the light was all about, nor can we retain the content of the light
After the light becomes thoughts which, in turn, unveil the significance of the light, we can remember the light and retain it
In learning to serve as a minister of the word, we have to realize the significance of the word mind in 1 Corinthians 14
If something has not reached our soul, our personality cannot make any use of it, and our will cannot control it
If a vessel cannot match God's light because of either its limitation or lack of capacity, God's light will suffer loss
You may know that light is present, yet because of distractions and unrelated burdens, you cannot translate the light you see into thoughts
When God's light is unveiled and our thoughts are low, narrow, or confused, we will surely miss much of its shining
Brothers, if our thoughts are undisciplined and out of focus all day long, how can we expect to retain God's light?
On the other hand, if something is wrong with our mind, light will not reach our outward man and cannot be translated into thoughts
If our mind is occupied by other things, we cannot use it in the things of God; we will not be able to translate God's light into thoughts
If our thoughts are revolving around other things, we will be in a maze, and we will not be able to come out of it
God's word also has its pathway; it has to go through some definite steps before it can be released as the ministry of the word
If something is wrong with his mind, God's word will remain in his spirit as light; he will not be able to translate it into thoughts
The interesting thing is that every time light comes to our spirit, we do not know what it means or what it is saying
Many times we see something, and like a rescue team rushing to a burning house, we quickly try to translate the light into thoughts
Before you try to engage your mind in the pursuit of God's light, you may think that you are a very clever man
Many people have a foolish idea: They think that a minister of God's word does not need to exercise his mind at all
When the mind is the master, it tries to find God's light by itself; it tries to figure out God's will or understand God's word
When man tries to come up with something by himself, he is exercising human wisdom, and this should be condemned and destroyed
We should bear in mind that when the outward man is broken, the power of the mind is not damaged; rather, it is enhanced
The breaking of the mind refers to the breaking of the self-centered mind, the self-motivated and self-propelled mind
When we say that the outward man needs to be broken, we do not mean that our mind should be so torn down that it can no longer function
Rather, we mean that it should no longer be full of thoughts for the self; it should not think in an undisciplined way
We should not misunderstand this breaking work; this work does not break down the organ itself or the function of the organ
If we do not walk according to the Spirit but according to the flesh, the law of sin and of death is manifested in us
If a man is led by the Lord to the point that he can think about the Spirit, he becomes spiritual and understands the spiritual things
Some people's minds are constantly occupied with human affairs; it is impossible for them to live by the law of the Spirit
If this were the case, Christianity would be a religion based on the flesh; it would not be based on revelation in the spirit
We know the things of God in our spirit, and we study, translate, and realize these things in our spirit through our mind
They do see the matter of justification, but when they stand up to speak about justification, there is a great shortage in them
When God's light fell upon him and the word was released through him, God as well as Paul himself could be found in the word
If our mind has not been dealt with and is unable to read and interpret God's light, the light is released in a weak way
Similarly, we can convey God's word to the brothers and sisters in a strong way, or we can convey it in a contaminated, weak way
If we want to be ministers of God's word, supplying others with Christ and God's word, our outward man must be broken
If a man wastes and squanders his thoughts on vain things, how can he have any capacity for thoughts pertaining to God?
Only those whose thoughts are perfect, lofty, rich, and clear have the ability to retain the contents of that flash
The perplexing thing is that we know that there is a speaking in our spirit and that this speaking has a certain significance
If we waste our God-given mental capacity on unnecessary things, we will find that there is no capacity for the understanding of God's word
Even if they think that they have solved these problems, others only come into contact with their thoughts when they touch them
Since the light is in our spirit, how can we expect to have a powerful ministry if it is discounted as soon as it reaches our mind?
A minister of God's word not only needs the light of God's revelation and the power to retain this light, but he also needs a burden
When the prophets served as ministers of the word, their service issued from their massa, that is, from their burdens
Even after light has been translated into thoughts, there will be no burden if the light goes away and only thoughts remain
A minister can have a burden before the Lord only insofar as light is complemented and retained by translated thoughts
If a man only has thoughts and nothing else, his speaking will be confused, go around in circles, and get nowhere, as if he were in a maze
When there is a shortage of words, the more one speaks, the more uneasy he becomes, and the less he is released
Whether or not a man can discharge his burden depends not so much on his utterance and thoughts as on whether or not he has God's word
We have to be clear before the Lord how our thoughts are turned into words and how the inner words are turned into outer words
In the very act of discharging our burden, we have to realize the difference between the inner words and the outer words
If we only have thoughts and no words except our own, we still are short of one thing, and we are not able to be a minister of the word
After we have light from God and after this light is retained in our thoughts, we have to learn to pray for words before God
When God's light shines into our spirit, it is a revelation; we have to translate this revelation into our thoughts
The retaining of light by the thoughts is man's work, a work that belongs to those who have learned the proper lessons from God
Another great step in the ministry of the word is to receive words from God to anchor and then to translate our thoughts
When we pray to God, we receive a clear light, and we are able to retain and hold on to this light; light is translated into thoughts in us
As we do this, we will begin to see something before God; He will give us a word or two that aptly expresses the sense within
Just as we capture the light we receive in our spirit with our thoughts, we capture light through the words which God gives to us today
In this way, the revelation we receive through the words becomes one with the revelation we have received in our spirit
In contrast to the vast amount that is revealed to us in an instant in our spirit, God's word comes to us only in one or two sentences
When God gives us a sentence or two to capture the light, these sentences contain not merely words but the whole revelation behind them
In ordinary speech, one only needs to speak eight words if there are eight words to say, or ten words if there are ten words to say
God may give us one sentence only, but that one sentence is packed with God's rich utterance and overflowing revelation
If we can receive a great amount of riches in an instant of revelation, we can also receive a great amount of riches in a single sentence
Every time we have a burden, no matter how heavy it is, we will receive a word related to it if we wait long enough before God
In capturing the light, our mind may understand what is involved, but we may not have the words to express our understanding
The one or two words that we have received are as rich in content as the entire revelation we received earlier
Even after the light is retained and translated into thoughts, there is still the need of the word, the word of revelation
As far as the fact is concerned, He has died for every person in this world, but not everyone has received this life
Even if a person can recite the truth of the Lord's death, it will not do him any good if he has not received the revelation
What we say may not be wrong, but we will not have the ministry of the word, and the Lord will not be released through us
Even if our mind is clear, we still may not be a minister of the word because we still do not have the proper words
If we do not have the appropriate words, we may speak for hours on the platform without conveying what we know
Once we receive these one, two, three, or five sentences from the Lord, we can release all the revelation we have received
When we go to the brothers and sisters, we should not go with an empty water bottle in our hand; we should be prepared to give them water
He may reach a certain point where the water is about to flow, yet he circles around again and the water is still held back
The strange thing is that before a man learns to be a minister of God's word, he may think that he has eloquence
Paul asked the Ephesians to pray for him that he might receive the word to make known the mystery of the gospel
The trouble with many people is that they keep on speaking, even though they are unable to release what they have within them
We should not search for these words when we are standing on the platform; we should have these words within us ahead of time
Our burden is to release God's revelation to man, and God's revelation is released through the words of revelation that we have received
Suppose we receive some intense light, and the Lord mercifully grants us an active, creative, and energetic mind to capture the light
God's revelation has already generated some benefit in us; it has become permanent, specific, and tangible thoughts in us
In our study of the Scripture, we may receive one or two phrases that aptly express what we have seen in our spirit
Those who only have the light of revelation without a word of revelation cannot expect to release the light of revelation
It is easier for God to speak through the Scripture, and it is easier for us to receive His word of revelation through the Scripture
In order to simplify things, we should say that there are four steps: light, thoughts, the inner words, and the outer words
We have mentioned previously that the light will fly away once it shines within us if there is no thought to capture the light
These one or two sentences of God's speaking cannot be understood or accepted if they are released in isolation
A minister of the word must first receive a divine word from God and then release this word with his own words
In his discussion concerning the ministry of the word, Paul made a comparison between tongues and the prophetic ministry
Our words can either release His word and magnify it before men, or they can seal up God's word and veil it from men
While one is speaking, how can he be certain that his speaking conveys to others the inner words that are hidden within him?
We find four things-two belong to the inner realm and two belong to the outer realm; two are from God and two are from us
Too much, we have suffered the frustration of losing the inner revelation as we are speaking according to the inner sense
At other times, we may retain the inner revelation, and the burden for the word may remain in us for two, three, or six months
On the other hand, as we are speaking, we have to look inwardly for the framework and speak according to this inner registration
The outer words that we release have to match the thoughts within, and others should see the light through such words
If we try to capture revelation with our own clever thoughts, we can only expect great sufferings for God's church
If we repeat the same word once, twice, or ten times, others will be bored by our speaking; they will not appreciate it
He can talk about many things, but as soon as he talks about spiritual things, he finds that he can do very little
The revelation and light we received, the burden and responsibility we have from God, form the basis of our speaking
The ministry of the word is related to the release of the inner word, the weighty word of God, through the release of the words of the Bible
If a man lacks inner revelation yet immerses himself in pure Bible exposition, his activity will remain on a very low plane
We have to see something ourselves and speak according to what we have seen before we can have the ministry of the word
It would be better for him to not say anything at all, than for him to go on for another hour without changing direction
While we practice serving as a minister of the word, we have to speak for the purpose of releasing our inner burden
We cannot come with a burden, speak for half an hour or an hour, and then find that our burden is still present
Sometimes we can have the strange experience that part of what we say is right and part of what we say is wrong
As a result, part of the burden that we bring to the meeting is discharged while another part is not discharged
We may inadvertently joke a little in the midst of our speaking, which may stir up uncontrollable laughter in the audience
Everyone carries a burden with the view of discharging it; no one carries a burden with a view to bringing it back to his starting point
If we do not know how to use the proper outer words, we will have quite a problem with the ministry of the word
A minister of God's word does not just use his mind to think of words to say; his words must come from another source
Once we know the source, we will realize that many things should not come out of our mouth; they cannot be considered as God's word
We must repeat the fact that there is a strong relationship between the ministry of the word and our human elements
When a minister of the word stands up to speak, he uses his own words, yet he is speaking the word which God has spoken within him
If the person is right the words will spontaneously be spiritual lofty and accurate they will be words that come as a result of touching God
There first must be the constitution of the Spirit within us; the Holy Spirit has to rearrange and reconstitute us
Was a brother who was under God and constituted by the Spirit to such an extent that his thoughts and feelings were almost the same as God's
God's revelation was almost the same as his own words; God's revelation was no longer an extraordinary thing in him
We all must pay attention to the fact that the basis of our speaking is the constitution of the Holy Spirit within us
Two persons can be equally useful to the Lord, and both may have attained equal depth of spirituality in the Lord
Both can be ministers, even lofty ministers of the word, yet the words that come from their mouths may be different
He has to deal with our flesh to such an extent that the release of a word from our flesh is the release of the word of God
God constitutes something into us through His indwelling Spirit and as we ponder over such things and enunciate them Gods word is released
A minister of God's word must allow the Spirit to constitute him to such an extent that the word is no longer objective, but subjective
God's constitution should be so strong that our word becomes not only similar to God's word but God's very own word
Since God's word is released through man, what manner of man must a person be, and what dealings must he go through!
We often hobble between a sense of victory and a sense of defeat, and after some days we find that we indeed have overcome
When we add up all the times that we are able to get through, we find that in the end we are able to overcome without our knowing it
We have to realize that this movement between light and darkness is a process through which God forms His word in us
While we are under trials and while our senses move back and forth between confusion and clarity, God is forming His word in us
The Lord is doing a carving work on our person today with the view that our person will eventually become an oracle for God's word
If we receive a dealing from God, it means that we may be receiving a revelation, a new unveiling, from Him as well
No matter how clever we are, how good our memory is, or how much we have received from man, we will be unable to speak effectively
In order for the Lord to give us the word, we first have to yield to His dealings, time after time, little by little
He received more help from the Lord's subsequent word than from the realization of the third heaven and Paradise
For two thousand years the church has been receiving help from the Lord's word to Paul: 'My grace is sufficient for you'
God granted Paul grace in the midst of such severe discipline, acknowledging, 'My grace is sufficient for you'
If we have not passed through a particular trial, we cannot effectively help those who are going through the same trial
We are taught by the Holy Spirit, and we have learned the words to say to others by passing through the fiery furnace
Unless our word is harnessed by fire, it will not do others any good; we will wonder what effect it has upon others
The church has received so much help from 2 Corinthians 12 during the last two thousand years because Paul had a thorn
As long as we have a desire to be a minister of the word, we have to take the lead to suffer what others have yet to suffer
God has not made us ministers of the word for the sake of just one person; He has made us ministers for the sake of many people
The amount of riches a minister of the word releases is very much related to the amount of dealings he has received from the Lord
As ministers of the word, we should face dealings that many will have to suffer; we should bear what many will have to bear
If he has experienced enough dealings from the Lord, he will have the right words when others come to him for help
A minister of God's word must be rich in utterance, and in order to be rich in utterance, he must be rich in dealings
The purpose of ministering to others is not merely to deliver them out of their dire situations or to bring them through their trials
The experience of a trial is not just for the sake of passing through the trial; it is for knowing the Lord through the trial
God has to use the Spirit's discipline to create a need in us which can only be satisfied by the Lord; only the Lord can bring us through
Perhaps we have known the Lord in many ways, yet our knowledge of Him concerning a certain matter is not complete
In this way, our knowledge of Christ will increase day by day, and we can minister the Christ we know to the church
Today there are thousands and millions of God's children in the church, but their knowledge of Christ is too limited
Today we may find a brother here or there in the church who is short of the knowledge of Christ in one or more aspects
It is not a simple matter to use others' experiences, because this results in too much activity in the mind if we are not careful
When we experience something from the Lord and we are led through such an experience, some words are formed in us
If we cannot walk ahead of the church in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we have no word to minister to the church
Our hope for you is firm, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you are of the comfort'
We are first comforted, and then we comfort others with the comfort with which we ourselves have been comforted
Many expressions, words, and illustrations cannot be used, because our speaking becomes shallow as soon as we use them
Some of us may have a good memory by birth, but when we serve as ministers, we realize how insufficient our memory is
We may not be able to boast that we remember everything about this doctrine, but we can say at least that we remember a big part of it
Suppose we see a revelation within, capture the light with our thoughts, and also have a few words to articulate what we have seen
We need the aid of our memory to transmit the inner words to the outside world and to express them in outer words
If we try to express and convey the revelation we have within, we find that we have forgotten what we have seen just a moment ago
We should spend some time to find out about the memory of the Holy Spirit before considering the outward memory
The problem today is that our outward memory often functions to remember the word, but the Spirit's memory is gone
Once the word is separated from the memory of the Spirit, it becomes something physical and is no longer spiritual
If a word of revelation is not nurtured in the Holy Spirit, a person can remember the words without remembering the revelation
It looked as if he had touched the gates of hell, and he was crying, 'Even hell is not big enough to swallow my sins'
Another brother testified that when this one talked about sin, others could feel sin like a thick, black cloud overshadowing them
When he stood up, he could say the same words, but the picture was gone; the revelation of the Spirit was gone
When you preach about it after a few days, it is possible that you still remember the word sinful, but the picture, the image, is gone
Unless we have this memory, we can speak on the evil and sinfulness of sin ten or twenty times without knowing what sin really is
We can only impress others with the sinfulness of sin when the memory of the Spirit reminds us of its sinfulness
When we speak according to this inner word, whether it is once or twice, life will be released, and others will see what we have seen
The outer words were not missing, but the more they spoke, the more they realized that they did not have the real thing
If we have the memory of the Holy Spirit, this memory will become operative as we speak and convey the inner word to others
If the words of revelation were nurtured in the memory of the Holy Spirit, he would have no trouble using them in his ministry of the word
We need the revelation, the thoughts, the inner words, and the outer words, and we also need the memory of the Holy Spirit
Only then will the words we speak be what the Lord wants us to speak, and only then will they be spiritual, not physical
If a man remains loose and forgetful, and if he is undisciplined in his thoughts and words, he is useless in the ministry of the word
If we allow ourselves to relax a little, we may still be able to do other things, but we will not be able to be a minister of the word
When we supply the outer words with this word of revelation, we will know what we are talking about as soon as we open our mouth
Sometimes we have the word within; we have the word of God's revelation, and we also have the memory of the Holy Spirit
The stronger our inward memory is before the Lord, the more our outward memory and inward memory will be purified
As our experience advances, we will find these two kinds of memory becoming more and more one; they will merge to become one memory
We will find that, along with the outward remembrance of the words, there is also the inward remembrance of the words
The memory of the Holy Spirit should lie between revelation and the inner words; it should be ready always to supply the inner words
The outward memory should be placed in between the inner words and the outer words; it should be ready always to supply the outer words
Without the feeding of the light, the inner words will die; they will become something physical, not spiritual
We have to use our own words, which we acquire by exercising our own memory to supply the outer words with the inner words
In exercising our own memory, we have to remember that the outward memory can never replace the function of the inner memory
Another thing we have to realize is that sometimes the outward memory can even become a barrier to the memory of the Holy Spirit
The outward memory is not only unqualified to substitute for the Spirit's memory, but at times it actually can frustrate the Spirit's memory
Even though the Lord has given us three or five words, we can forget them all and be unable to remember one thing
The few words will refresh the seeing, and the entire revelation within us will come alive again as we read these words
If we miss something, we will feel its weight, because we have not communicated what God wants to convey to His children
If we release all the points except one, the light will be veiled, and we will feel the weight and the bondage
We may miss what we intend to speak in the first place, and when we return home, our burden becomes even heavier
It is easy for us to speak on an Old Testament passage or a New Testament passage and then get carried away by it
We have expounded the Scripture and explained the doctrine, but we have not discharged the burden that God has given us
We must not be satisfied with just repeating something in the Old Testament and the New Testament; we must release our own words as well
Two of these things, light and the inner words, are of God, while the other two, thoughts and memory, are of the minister himself
Before a minister of the word opens his mouth to speak, he needs to have two things available to him-his own thoughts and his memory
God's children can most readily discern the spirit from the will because there is a great difference between them
It is easy to confuse the two because the spirit does not flow independently; when it flows, it carries feelings with it
In the same way, the spirit and the feelings are two different things, yet the former is expressed through the latter
For those who have never learned the spiritual lessons, the spirit and the feelings are one and the same thing
In order for the spirit of the minister of the word to be free, it must have suitable feelings to express itself
If our feelings are unusable, or if they are heading in a different direction from that of our spirit, the spirit is unable to do anything
The only explanation is that their spirit is not released, and their spirit is not released because their feelings are not released
When their feelings are not released, the Holy Spirit does not have a channel through which to release Himself
A brother may have seen the sinfulness of sin, but when he stands up to speak, he may not feel the sinfulness of sin
Only then will a word on the sinfulness of sin affect them, and only then will our word convey the proper feeling to them
We may need to say a very strong word today, but the more we speak, the weaker we feel; our feeling cannot match our speaking
They have to speak until they come up to a desired level before they are able to convey the same word to others
Words that are meant for others have to be spoken to the ministers first because they are a barrier to their word
It is a serious problem with many people to find, after stepping onto the platform, that they are in fact a barrier to their own words
We can only expect others to believe our word if we believe the word ourselves and have a feeling for it ourselves
In the previous discussion of the minister as a person, we paid special attention to the breaking of the outer man
We need to see how the Lord breaks our outer man and how He prepares our feelings for the ministry of the word
Although the feelings are the most tender part of a person, these feelings are still crude and are useless in the eyes of God
A man may think that he is clever and resourceful, and the Lord can bring down his exalted mind in one great shining
The Lord wants us to live in a stricken spirit, which means that He wants us to have the feeling of being stricken
The Lord has to work on us so much that we fear and tremble in our feeling, that we no longer dare to be cavalier or lazy
The breaking of the feelings may not be as drastic as the breaking of the will and the mind, but it is much deeper
As we are dealt with repeatedly, we become genuinely happy when our hearts are happy and genuinely sad when our hearts are sad
When God's word comes to us again, we will sense the feelings of the word, and our feelings will match the word
Peter was full of feelings as he spoke, and because his feelings were so strong, he was able to lift up his voice when he spoke
If a man's feelings have been finely ground, he will rejoice when God's word calls for rejoicing and weep when God's word calls for weeping
When the Bible speaks of joy, the proper reaction is to rejoice, and when it speaks of sadness, the proper reaction is to grieve
Brothers, if the Lord does not conquer our feelings completely, we will be useless in the ministry of the word
The Lord often lays His hand on us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit with the purpose of turning our feelings toward others
God must discipline us and deal with us until we do not have feelings for ourselves and until our feelings become tender
All ministers of the word have to remember that their words can only go as far as the breaking they have received from God
If words are spoken yet feelings lag behind, the two are out of step, and the utterance will not be satisfactory
We may try to say more, and we may try to raise our voice, but something still is wrong because our feelings do not match our speaking
If the Lord has dealt with our self-love once or twice, when we speak about self-love, our feelings spontaneously will match our speaking
If our pride has been dealt with, when we speak about pride and about the Lord resisting the proud, our feelings will match our words
Whether or not others hear just words or hear the words and see the light depends on whether the minister's spirit is released
Whether or not a person falls on his face at the word or remains unchanged depends on whether the minister can release his spirit
The words may be perfectly right in themselves, but there is also a matter of the kind of spirit that accompanies the release of these words
The result that the words produce in others depends not so much on the words themselves but on how the spirit is released
When we stand up to speak in the meeting, it is possible that our spirit will not move, and we will have to push it out
If we do not touch the spirit, we will only know that the demon was cast out; we will not know what exactly happened
We will not know whether Paul was speaking with a loud or strong tone of voice, because we have not touched the spirit
If we have never been dealt with by the Lord or if the dealing is not deep pure or clean enough our spirit can never go out with Gods word
We need to remember that listening to a message has nothing to do with listening to the words; it has to do with touching the spirit
Of course, the stronger our spirit is before the Lord, the easier it is for us to release it; we can release it again and again
At least once or more than once, he has released his spirit, forcing his spirit to go out with his words, and others have touched his spirit
If we preach a word of revelation and release our spirit at the same time, others will touch not only the word but the spirit as well
The extent to which his spirit is released is determined by the amount of training he has received from God in his spirit
Just like Paul, when he went through his experiences described in 2 Corinthians, we may find these environments to be severe and harsh
The environments the Lord prepares for us are always greater than what we can bear and what our strength can handle
How common is our speaking concerning looking to Him at such times, and we thoughtlessly speak of relying on Him!
Only when the Lord puts us in a hopeless situation do we begin to learn to trust in Him and to rely on Him a little
It is in the midst of such weaknesses that we acquire a little faith, a little trust, and a little reliance on Him
As our spirit learns something, receives some dealing, and passes through some training, our entire person also rises up out of the trial
They have been delivered out of their circumstances, and the Lord will grant them similar victories when they encounter similar situations
Different ministers of the word have different degrees of spiritual power because they experience different kinds of building work
We may be trained, but the extent to which we have been trained determines the extent to which our spirit can be used
The degree to which our spirit is trained determines the extent to which we can be used as a minister of the word
Whenever a minister of the word encounters a trial or an affliction he should realize that God is using it to prepare him to be His minister
The night the Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, He said to the disciples, 'The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak'
One has to exhaust all his energy, being spent to the point of experiencing spiritual fatigue and spiritual death
There is a price involved in releasing the spirit in this way; it is a release of burden, a release that results in pain and fatigue
As soon as we are filled with the word, we will see that those sitting before us are filled with darkness; they cannot see
We have to release our spirit in a strong way, as if we are storming the stronghold of darkness and confronting the attack of darkness
We are preaching God's word on the one hand, and we are confronting the attack of the forces of darkness on the other hand
While a minister of the word does not necessarily have to pay this high price every time, he must be willing to pay such a price
Whenever a person fulfills a spiritual ministry whenever he exercises his spirit he carries a burden that seems to demand all of his energy
If he is not willing to sacrifice himself and is not willing to pay the price, he will make the meeting a common thing
If we are exhausted, lazy, or reluctant to do anything, we can say the same thing in a hurried way, but our spirit will be bound
If, however, a man has been wounded in some kind of way or is going through some experiences, his words may produce no effect at all
When one is willing to pay the price to release his spirit through the word, others will see the light and touch the reality
If he cannot find the right feelings at the critical moment, his spirit will also suffer; it will not be released
Whatever we say should be what the spirit wants to say, and whatever terminology we use should be the terminology of the spirit
If our thoughts are a little relaxed, confused, or our memory fails a little, our spirit will be in jeopardy; it will be injured
If he pushes out his spirit voluntarily and willingly, his listeners will not hear just a message; they will touch something behind the word
If he does not push out his spirit in his speaking, others will not touch the very thing hidden behind the word
A strong ministry of the word is one in which the amount of words equals the amount of spirit, that is, the two are the same
Sometimes one faces special circumstances in which special needs arise, and God may allow one's spirit to go beyond his words
No minister of the word can function with a dormant spirit, because the ministry of the word is the release of the spirit
Every minister of the word must be able to speak and, at the same time, must be able to push out the spirit behind the word
He can predict whom he will shower his spirit upon, and his spirit will come as a shower to that person and soak him thoroughly
When the spirit is released in this way, others will touch something and will fall down no matter how stubborn they may be
His intention is for the church to be the innermost being out of which will flow rivers of living water of the Spirit
God has not poured out His anointing oil indiscriminately on the whole world; He has poured it out on the church
No part of the flesh can contain the Holy Spirit; the spirit is the only place that can contain the Holy Spirit
In Romans 8 it is hard to tell which occurrence of the word spirit refers to the human spirit and which refers to the Holy Spirit
The release of the spirit does not refer just to the release of our spirit, but to the release of the Holy Spirit as well
When we speak to a brother or to an unbelieving sinner, our spirit determines the degree of the release of the Holy Spirit
Both speak of the Lord forgiving the sins of those whom we forgive and retaining the sins of those whose sins we retain
If authority rested solely with the Holy Spirit, the success or failure of a minister would not be of much consequence
Today God has not kept the work of the Holy Spirit in His hand; He has put this work in the hand of the ministers
Whether or not others will touch spiritual reality when they listen to us depends on the release of our spirit
When we stand up to speak and willingly and voluntarily push out the Holy Spirit, others will not only hear doctrine; they will touch life
Whether or not others touch the outward shell of the word or the life within the word depends on whether we have pushed out the spirit
If a man opens his heart, eyes, and spirit and does not see anything, the responsibility rests with the minister
If one has to ask for light after he has understood a message, it means that the message and the light are still two separate things
If the light does not come, it means that something is wrong with the ministry of the word; the frustration is with the minister
The brothers and sisters are responsible for opening their eyes, while the ministers are responsible for giving them light
He must release the light not only in a way that seeks understanding but in a way that causes men to fall on their face
A worker often pays attention only to the audience's understanding; his only motive and desire are for his audience to understand his word
If he is willing to pay the price before the Lord, he will push out his spirit in such a way that his word will release light
The light will be so strong that others will understand not only the words, but they will be subdued by it as well
If we are willing and the pressure within us is strong enough, the word will burst forth in the form of a rebuke
One day Paul became fed up and he said to the spirit I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and the spirit came out
When the Lord came out of Bethany, He saw a fig tree that was barren, and He said to it, 'May no one eat fruit from you forever'!
Our mind, words, memory, and feelings all help us in the release of our message, but it is our spirit that is the necessary ingredient
One thing is certain: The kind of spirit that we have determines the kind of expression of the Holy Spirit that we bear
When the Holy Spirit flows, He carries along with Him the characteristic of the person who bears the flow, and He reaches men in this way
The experiences of many saints show us that the Holy Spirit reaches other men with the special characteristic of the bearer
The Lord's word indicates that one must first drink the water, and then the rivers of living water must flow out of his innermost being
It is out of the deepest part of one's being that the Holy Spirit flows; the Holy Spirit flows out together with the person
When this water reaches a person, the Holy Spirit carries this person's characteristics with Him, and flows to others this way
A particular aspect of our character often goes through some dealings, but the work is not complete, and there are still impurities
All the dealings, trials, and occurrences in our environment are for the purpose of increasing our usefulness in the Lord
They work together to bring about a purer flow when our spirit is released and to increase the usefulness of our spirit
Today God may grant us mercy and allow His Spirit to be released through us, and we may think that we are now a great servant of the Lord
We may think that all is well, without any realization that His selection was merely provisional in its measure
The words can be the same, but if we do not have the proper spirit, there will be flaws in the release of our spirit
God has entrusted His Christ to the church with the intention that the church would communicate this Christ to others
God also has entrusted His Holy Spirit to the church with the intention that the church would communicate this Holy Spirit to others
Protestantism has forgotten the position of the church, while Catholicism has tried to usurp God's blessing with carnal hands
For the past two thousand years, countless fleshly hands have touched God's work, and countless carnal hands have contaminated His work
We have to dispense such a strong word to others so that they can do nothing but see the light and fall on their face
Serving as a minister of the word is an altogether new thing to us; we have never done such a thing before in our life
In learning to be a minister of the word, we should forget about our previous speaking and preaching experience
The ministry of the word is very new to us; it is different from any of our former training, understanding, and practices
As far as being a minister of the word is concerned, we are babies; we have to learn everything from the beginning
In one sense this is the easiest thing to do, because a new believer can pray the first day of his Christian life
On the other hand, while one is learning to be a minister, God will show him that the whole endeavor is not that hard after all
It is a total failure on the part of the ministry of the word to release the word without releasing the spirit
We can only say that with many sins and defilements, a slight touch, contact, or contamination, can injure our spirit
He should confess all of his known sins and defilements before God, and he should seek cleansing and forgiveness for them
As soon as our mind wanders, moves out of focus, or fails to catch up with our thoughts, our spirit is injured
Sometimes we also may give an illustration which is out of place as far as the spirit is concerned and the spirit is injured again and bound
A whole passage may not be according to the Spirit; that is, we have not touched the leading of the Spirit in speaking it
If we do not pay attention to this matter but insist on speaking carelessly, we will find it impossible to push out our spirit
When we meet together in a certain place, we should be filled with fear, but we should not be filled with a soulish self-consciousness
Once soulish self-consciousness arises, our spirit is injured and debilitated; we are unable to push out our spirit any longer
A minister of God's word must learn to free himself from any self-consciousness before he can function effectively
When we convey God's word to others, any sense of inferiority lowers God's word, and our spirit becomes weak and empty
Soulish inferiority, however, comes from introspection which, in turn, comes from self-examination and a fear of men
If we are short of one aspect our spirit will be injured and once our spirit is injured we are not able to serve as a minister of the word
The Spirit may want to place a passage at the end of his speaking, while he may put it at the beginning of his speaking
When the speaking turns from one passage of the Scripture to another, we must exercise care not to make any mistake
If a certain passage of the Scripture should be used yet we miss it the spirit is unable to make the turn and it loses touch with the word
Those who are more experienced before God are stumbled mainly by the dislocation between the word and the spirit
At the beginning of ones training the problem is mainly with the injured spirit the cause of bondage in the spirit is injury in the spirit
When we make a turn with the word, our thoughts and feelings may not be agile and rich enough to follow the turn
The words may be released smoothly, yet the spirit is left behind; it cannot follow the word and loses contact with it
When we speak, we have to learn to release both the word and the spirit so that the two do not lose touch with each other
We have to look to God for mercy that our words make the right turns and that they do not lose contact with the spirit
Whenever we make a wrong or improper turn from one subject to another, we fail to keep our whole message in the spirit
Whether or not a minister of the word can make the right turn in his speaking depends more on the Lord's mercy than on man's planning
It is difficult for us to dictate how strong our words will be or how much we can keep our entire message in the spirit
After speaking for a few minutes with both the word and the spirit moving together, we know that we made the right turn a moment earlier
Whether or not someone is saved or has received help is a matter that is in the hands of the Lord; it is not in our hands
If our spirit is not released, our word is not God's word; it is only an imitation of His word, not His very own word
A man has to remain in foolishness, darkness, and total blindness to appreciate and be content with his own words
If a brother takes pride in his own preaching it can only mean one thing He is merely a preacher he does not have the ministry of the word
As ministers of the word, we exercise our will to pack the spirit into the word and then release and push out this word
The anointing is before us, and by God's mercy, our mind produces a word that matches the sense of the anointing within
When he finds where the anointing is, he finds the 'seam' through which he can squeeze out his word sentence by sentence
As he is releasing his word this way, he may want to bless his audience; he may want to discharge the blessing with a strong impact
The outer man must be broken because the spirit can realize its function only to the extent that the outer man is broken
In such a case whether the word comes to our mind at the beginning of the speaking or at the end the spirit is not released in our speaking
If the Spirit cannot use our mind when He calls for it, we are frustrated from serving as a minister of the word
If a minister of the word bases his activity on his mind, such activity should be condemned and destroyed to the uttermost
If a word comes to our mind first, we should speak it first; if it comes to our mind last, we should speak it last
The things that should be spoken first will come to our mind first, and the things that should be spoken last will come to our mind last
In his speaking, a minister of the word has to pay attention to the difference between the climax of the word and the climax of the spirit
Sometimes the climax in the spirit does coincide with the climax in the speaking, but this is not always the case
It would be a simple job for the minister of the word if the climax of the word always coincided with the climax in the spirit
When we know what the peak of the speaking should be, we aim our words at that peak and climb up gradually until we reach that peak
Sometimes as soon as we touch the heart of our speaking, the spirit is released in a strong, powerful, and explosive way
Often the center and climax of the speaking have not arrived; only a few simple words are said, and they may be said indifferently
The strange thing is that when the word reaches the peak without the spirit, it is hard to push out one's spirit at such times
In our preaching we should pay attention to these two things: the high point in the word and the high point in the release of the spirit
While a minister of the word must have his mind focused on the word, his mind also must be available to the Holy Spirit
While we are speaking, we should test the Holy Spirit to find out whether our speaking is in the right direction
The more our word hits the right spot the more anointing we will have and the more our word will bring us to the spiritual climax the apex
When the spirit is gone and the word is left to itself, the speaker should terminate his speaking on this point
We should be on the alert that the mind does not become so rigid that we fail to touch the Lord's present word and His climax
If we do this, our word will catch up with the climax of the spirit when we function in the ministry of the word
If we do not have any experience, we have nothing in our memory; we cannot remember what we have never acquired
These thoughts are not extemporaneous or imaginary thoughts; they are acquired through one's previous experiences
We may want to say something, and as we are considering what to say, our mind will go to our memory storehouse
Whatever the Lord wants to say comes out of his mouth spontaneously; he has the right word to convey the Lord's utterance
The Holy Spirit directs the mind, and the mind searches through all our experiences in our memory and then releases them as the word
Without any effort on our part, the Spirit can call to mind something we have learned or seen and then place it in our mind
If the mind is undisciplined, it is not able to recall these words, and the spirit is frustrated from being released
In order for the memory to have the adequate materials, we have to learn many lessons before the Lord and experience many things
As we increase our deposit gradually and continuously, there is room in our memory storehouse to keep the inventory
There will be little place in our memory to direct our inventory, and we will have nothing for the Spirit to draw from
If we do not let go, we will have reservations, and as long as we have reservations, the word will never be released
A young brother who has never received any deep revelation needs the outpouring; this outpouring will loosen him up
On the day of Pentecost, Acts 2:14 says, 'Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them'
When the pressure of the Spirit is heavy upon a man and his feelings are pressed, he is forced to speak in a loud voice
When Peter and John were released from prison, the brothers gathered together and lifted up their voice to God
If we do not let go today and if we still have reservations in our feelings, we will find reservations in the spirit as well
In the case of the Lord Jesus, in the prayer of the first church, and in the cases of Peter and Paul, strong feelings were released
If a weeping prophet cannot produce a weeping people, a prophet who does not weep will surely not produce a weeping people
If the nature of our speaking is different from the nature of God's word, we will surely encounter problems in our speaking
They should practice speaking to others for five minutes to see whether or not others understand what they are saying
Since we are here to speak for God, we have to learn to speak, and our words have to be uttered clearly sentence by sentence
Some brothers speak in such a low way when they quote a verse that it is difficult to imagine that God's word can be released through them
Some brothers have such a childish way of exhortation that one wonders how God's word can come out of their mouth
It is harder for us to speak than it was for Martin Luther, because the release of God's word is always advancing onward and upward
His work today is more advanced than His work yesterday, and His work tomorrow will be more advanced than His work today
What men have seen in the last one hundred years concerning justification by faith is much more than what Luther saw
The discovery of biblical truth, the release of God's word, and the things that the church receives from God are advancing day by day
Today we are even clearer: The kingdom is not only a matter of reward but also a matter of spiritual reign and rule
In order for the church to grow to full stature and to touch the fullness of Christ we believe that the riches of the ministry must increase
While the minister of the word bears more than half of the responsibility, the audience bears at least some of the responsibility also
Whether or not the word can be released depends largely on the ministers, but the audience has its responsibility also
The audience can become a hindrance to the release of God's word, and it can also become a strengthening to God's word
A wise and intelligent man cannot receive direct revelation from God, and he cannot receive revelation from the ministers of the word
Whenever the ministry finds wise and intelligent ones among its audience, God's word is immediately frustrated
It can be so frustrated that it is completely blocked, or it can be frustrated to the extent that it is released only in a mild or weak way
Daniel shows us the fact of the sealing, while the Lord Jesus shows us the reason for the sealing-being wise and intelligent
Once a man becomes wise and intelligent, the Holy Spirit, in accordance with God's counsel, hides the word from him
The Bible gives us a basic principle: After man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the way to the tree of life was blocked
From that time forward, the tree of life was sealed up by the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every way
When we speak to new believers, we may not have to exercise our spirit that much; there may not be that much need for light and words
If there is a big demand for the release of the spirit, such a person will become a great frustration to the ministry of the word
We must also see that, in addition to the qualifications of the ministers, there is the condition of the audience
We are not altogether clear how the audience affects the speaking, but it is a fact that the audience does affect the speaking
In learning to be a minister of the word, we have to remember that sometimes the problem is with us; the word is withheld in us
The more spiritual the things we try to impart to others are, the easier it is for our speaking to be affected by men
Following this phrase there is a colon, which indicates that this wisdom is 'both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
It takes exceedingly great power to do all these, and all of these are included in the Lord Jesus as our wisdom
In the end Christ becomes our righteousness, Christ becomes our sanctification, and Christ becomes our redemption
A man cannot appropriate the work of the Lord directly; all of His work is preserved in the realm of revelation
When the Lord opens his eyes a little and he sees that the Lord has died for him, he receives the Lord's death in that instant
If we understand this spiritual principle, we will realize that the ministry of the word is very much affected by the audience
If we are like infants, waiting simply, humbly, and meekly before the Lord, spontaneously He will become our wisdom
When we take Christ as our wisdom before God, we will easily find righteousness, sanctification, and redemption as well
If we do not take Christ as our wisdom, we will not be able to find righteousness, sanctification, or redemption anywhere
If the audience of the ministry of the word is proud selfassured or closed in spirit God will not be able to put any revelation into them
Romans 11:8 says, 'As it is written, 'God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes to see not and ears to hear not, until this very day'
In chapter thirteen there is more than an ordinary kind of hiding; it is a hiding that is based on chapter twelve
They hated the Lord so much that they closed their eyes and accused Him of casting out demons by the ruler of the demons
They clearly knew that the Lord Jesus cast out demons by the Holy Spirit, yet they hated Him for no reason at all
When they hated the Lord, they blasphemed the Holy Spirit and said that He cast out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons
He answered saying Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens but to them it has not been given
Once a man has his own inclinations, prejudices, reluctances, and fault-finding attitudes, even God's light has to stop
What they see is passed on from one printed page to another mouth, and from that mouth to another printed page
We are afraid of committing sin, but we should be more afraid of committing sin without knowing that we have committed sin
Please remember that sinners could be saved at the time of the Lord Jesus, but the Pharisees could not be saved
Matthew 13 and Romans 11 show us a principle: A man can become so fallen that God's light is completely sealed off from him
The sealing off of revelation means the sealing off of repentance, and the sealing off of repentance means the sealing off of forgiveness
The Pharisees blasphemed the Holy Spirit; they could no longer repent, which meant that they would no longer receive any revelation
If a minister of the word encounters a person sealed from God, it will be impossible for him to release any light to that person
