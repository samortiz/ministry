   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Human Spirit Being Able</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Contact God and to Be One with Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because our human spirit is close to God and there is a transmission between God the Spirit and our human spirit, our human spirit is able to contact God and to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 4:24, which says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit, proves that our spirit is able to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit bears witness with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse uses the preposition with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That means God's Spirit is one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This little word with is very precious, indicating that now our spirit is one with God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to stress these points again and again, especially with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The new ones who have come into the church life in the last two years need this kind of help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WITH A MIND TO UNDERSTAND GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man was made not only with a spirit but also with a mind to understand God Luke 24:45; Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To contact God, to receive God, and to contain God is one thing, but to understand God is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a spirit to receive God but we also have a soul, a psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In referring to people, the Bible calls them souls Exo 1:5; Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every person is a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are a psychological being, a soul, with the faculty of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created man with a mind, a part of the soul, so that man could understand God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The understanding is the function of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke 24:45 says that the Lord opened the mind of the disciples to understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a very good verse proving that we need to understand God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WITH AN EMOTION TO LOVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man was also created with an emotion to love God Matt 22:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible shows that in our psychological being, besides the mind as the understanding organ, there is also the emotion as the loving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew 22:37 says that we should love the Lord our God with all our heart and all our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mind is also a part of the heart but it is separately mentioned in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the mind is separately mentioned here, surely this indicates that the heart in this verse must refer to the loving function of the heart, that is, the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we receive God, we have to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we understand Him, surely we have to appreciate Him, like Him, love Him, and treasure Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, an emotion, the loving function of our heart, was also prepared for us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>WITH A WILL TO CHOOSE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man was created with a will to choose God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without his will, man would have no choice, no decision, no direction, and no goal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, God created a strong choosing organ for man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our psychological being, our will is the strongest part.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even after the fall of man, God still somewhat preserved the human will for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, this is a strong determination on our part by the exercise of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Martin Luther is an example of a person whose will was very strong, so he had great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To have strong faith always depends upon a very strong will.</S>
