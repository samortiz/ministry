   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Every Gate Being a Pearl</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 21 says, And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that gold signifies the divine nature and that the precious stones signify what is produced by the transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The significance of the pearl is found in the way it is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life-juice over us to make us precious pearls for the building of God s eternal expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must admire God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nearly everything in His creation is an illustration of an aspect of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He used many of the things found in nature as parables.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Light, wheat, food, and even pearl-producing oysters are parables.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ, the living One, entered into our death situation and lived in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through living in the waters of death, He was wounded by us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After wounding Him, we remained near His wound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we repented, believed in Him, and received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How deeply we appreciate the wounds He suffered in His crucifixion!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we stay near His wounds, He secretes the life-juice of His resurrection life, and this life-juice envelops us and eventually transforms us into pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By staying at Christ s wound, we receive His life and are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By remaining there after our regeneration, we are also transformed and become pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This entrance meets the requirement of the law as represented by Israel and as observed by the guarding angels v. 12 . Hence, the pearl is the entrance into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How did you enter into the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Did you climb over the wall?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This would be impossible because the wall is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only way to enter into the New Jerusalem is through the pearl gates, through the gates constituted with the overcoming death and the life-imparting resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord, we have all entered the New Jerusalem in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We confessed, we repented, we appreciated His death, and we enjoyed staying at His wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Immediately, we received the life-secretion that regenerated us and that is now transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through our experience of the death and resurrection of Christ, we have passed through the pearl gates and are now within the city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fact that each one of the gates is, respectively, of one pearl indicates that the entrance into the city is unique and once for all; that is, it is only through the once-for-all regeneration by Christ s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Bearing the Names</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>of the Twelve Tribes of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the twelve gates of the city v. 12 . Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law watches and observes to insure that all the communications, the comings in and the goings out, of the holy city meet its requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, all the communications of this city are according to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostles represent grace, whereas the twelve tribes of Israel represent the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The twelve gates were produced according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ died for our sin according to the law and, in a very positive sense, He was also resurrected from among the dead for the complement of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even our repentance was according to the law, for we repented because we had violated the law, and we confessed our sins according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the law was the basic factor in Christ s death and in our repentance and confession.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the twelve pearl gates are absolutely according to the law and have fulfilled the requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our entrance into the holy city did not break the law; rather, it was according to the law and even a fulfillment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whatever the law required was fulfilled in our entering into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, we entered into New Jerusalem according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our entrance was altogether legal and lawful because by His death and resurrection Christ had completely fulfilled the requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This matter is quite deep.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because our entrance into the New Jerusalem through the pearl gates had to be according to the law, we all had to repent, confess our sins, and say O Lord Jesus, You not only died for my sins; You also died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, I confess that I am sinful, that I have committed a great many sins, and that I am worthy of nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, how I thank You for dying for me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of repentance and confession fulfills the requirement of the law and makes our entrance into the city lawful.</S>
