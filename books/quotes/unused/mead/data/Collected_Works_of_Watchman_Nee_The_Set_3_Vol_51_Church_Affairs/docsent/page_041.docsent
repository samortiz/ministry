   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Responsible Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Taking Care of This Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to seek out saints who are especially helpful to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The responsible brothers need to tell them, "We hope that you can speak more.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many brothers and sisters who possess no judgment of propriety in their speaking; it is rather clear that they have little gift and little grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The responsible brothers may inform them privately to speak less.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You need to give some people a time limitation, but do not offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If some brothers stand up to speak for only two minutes, they can really render help to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But they may like to drag on, and when they drag on, their speaking becomes too long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to tell such brothers that if they speak for two minutes, the brothers and sisters will receive help, but that the help is reduced by the third minute and exhausted by the fourth minute.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, you must bring them to see that they should speak in a simple way for two minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need to tell some people that it is sufficient for them to speak for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If everyone who stands up to speak is dealt with thoroughly, this meeting will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people are very self-confident, always believing that they can help others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not know that they must touch man's spirit, and they think that they can render help to people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If no one tells them this, they will not know.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the responsible brothers need to tell them that their words should be brief when they speak before God; when their words are lengthy, they cannot give people help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the responsible brothers would speak in this way, that would help them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a certain brother speaks and gives help to people, the responsible brothers should encourage him to speak again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the responsible brothers are not all ministers of the word, the care of the church is their business.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, you should not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Encourage some brothers to speak more that the church may receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You need to restrain some other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they speak briefly, the church can receive the benefit, but when they speak too long, there is no help.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the responsible brothers are not passive but active to take care of the meeting, I believe that the type of meeting in 1 Corinthians 14 can bring many riches to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The crucial point is that the responsible brothers should not speak loosely or deal with people carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they are not careful, they will offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As an elder of the church, the most feared thing is to offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit is the true representative of Christ to execute His authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders must understand the mind of Christ and then speak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they do not know the mind of Christ, they should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they do not speak carefully, they will offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Sisters Giving Testimonies</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Question: In the type of meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14, can the sisters give testimonies?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Answer: I personally think that testimonies may be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Question: According to 1 Corinthians 14, they should not open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Answer: Yes, according to 1 Corinthians 14 they should not open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if a sister wants to give a testimony, it would be better for a responsible brother to ask her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a different matter, and the responsibility is on the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Her head is covered, and she is not presuming headship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE PRAYER MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two or three special matters in the prayer meeting which the brothers should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Be Short</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, tell all the brothers who pray to learn to be short.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ten out of ten prayer meetings are ruined by long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the prayer meeting everyone should learn to pray in a short way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elderly brothers may have a few long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But tell the new believers from the very beginning to learn to be short.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the prayer meeting to have power and be strong, the prayer has to be short.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Long prayers are often padded with many empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you come to a prayer meeting, you should remember to tell the brothers to pray short prayers.</S>
