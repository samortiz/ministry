   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-SIX HEAD OVER ALL TO THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-11, 22-23; 3:17a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The deepest chapters in Ephesians are chapters one and three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The positive things unfolded in these chapters are far beyond our ability to grasp or apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, in 1:10, Paul says, Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not think that very many Christians have an adequate understanding of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This word does not refer to the preeminence of Christ, to the authority of Christ, or to the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse is unique, and no other verse in the Scriptures can be compared to it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we read about husbands loving their wives or about wives submitting to their husbands, we readily understand, for such things as love and submission fit into our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in order to grasp the meaning of verses such as 1:10, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOD S ETERNAL ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we consider 1:9 and 10, we see that the economy or dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The times refer to the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fullness of the times will be when the new heaven and new earth come, after all the dispensations of God in all the ages have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God s economy has been completed, Christ will head up all things universally.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has made Christ the Head over all things 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will be God s eternal administration and economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because our physical body has a head, it is possible for our body to stand upright.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we stand on our feet, it is actually the head which enables us to stand erect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that our head causes our entire body to be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person has his head cut off, his body will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the head causes every part of the body to be headed up, all the things that are on the body clothing, shoes, eyeglasses are headed up also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire universe is under Christ s heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, some things are still in a state of collapse because the process of the heading up of all things in Christ has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the economy of the fullness of times, everything will be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing will continue to be in a state of collapse, and nothing will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Christ God will head up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At present many things in the universe are still falling or collapsing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But at the dispensation of the fullness of the times, nothing will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not even a leaf will fall from a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CHRIST S NEED FOR THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have pointed out that our head functions to head up every part of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same principle, God is using Christ to head up all things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the universal Head of all things, Christ needs a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as clothing and other items rest on a person s body, so one day everything in the universe will rest on Christ s Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have seen that if a person has his head cut off, his body and everything on it will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principle is the same with Christ as the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If all the things in the universe are not headed up in Christ through His Body, they will remain in a state of collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Scientists have their explanations for such phenomena as the falling of leaves from trees.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They put forth their reasons for the various physical changes that take place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These scientific explanations and reasons may be correct temporarily, but they will not be correct eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not know physics or biology, but I do know the process of the divine heading up of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, I believe 1:10 when it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this process will reach its completion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From that time onward, nothing in the universe will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everything will rest on the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is heading up the Body, and all the billions of items in the universe will rest on this headed-up Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although we do not see a full picture of this today, we do see it in miniature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We also can enjoy a foretaste of the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not think that a person can stand upright mainly because his legs, ankles, and feet are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have pointed out that it is actually the head that enables us to stand erect.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Apart from the heading up of the body by the head, the body and everything on it will fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a picture of the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Firstly, Christ heads up His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then in the dispensation of the fullness of the times, God will head up all things in Christ through the Body.</S>
