   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CARE OF NEEDY SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two Western brothers, one of whom was a doctor, were among us for a period of time, but their work was not very profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They had a desire to serve with the saints, but we felt that they did not obtain much profit; neither did they render much profit to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lack of profit was not related to edification but to the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In relation to the building up of the church, we felt that receiving them into the service would result in a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As those who serve the Lord, we should not gossip or be careless in our conversations about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a fact, however, that our contact with these two brothers gave rise to many problems instead of the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to our realization, problems could arise because we did not fully know what kind of persons these brothers were.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also were not certain what they were able to do or what would be the result of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who contacted them were confused and unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They helped many saints medically for no charge and even paid hospital expenses for some saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, all their work resulted in some tearing down of the church, not a building up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day my wife and I went to visit the brother who was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the way we saw a sister whose child had contracted tuberculosis and had been operated on twice by this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sister felt that it was the Lord s mercy that this brother had charged her only half the fees the first operation and performed the second without charging her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, this brother was kind and took care of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the other hand, the ones he took care of were grateful to him but did not gain more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, it was not for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, those whom he helped were not uplifted in their person; instead, they felt that they were inferior to this brother and to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, what this brother did in love was actually a tearing down of the church, not a building up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this brother had a burden to help the saints materially, he could still accept medical fees and be led by the Lord to put something into the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the brothers and sisters would receive help directly from God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They would not have a feeling of being debased before men; they would not feel that they had received help from man or even from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They would simply feel that God had visited them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This would build them up with a noble character.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our help causes the brothers and sisters to feel inferior or indebted to us, we are tearing down the church rather than building it up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our help should not cause others to feel grateful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, they should not feel inferior to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They should not feel that they are our beneficiaries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we give people such a feeling, we are a charitable organization, not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The saints should not merely feel grateful to us, the church, or the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must lead them to Christ; only this results in the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we maintain an attitude of giving alms, showing pity, or assisting the poor saints, we are corrupting the Lord s church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the sister whose son had contracted tuberculosis repeatedly thanked and praised the Lord, her entire being was corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In her debasement, she became reliant on others and even subservient to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who always receive help from others cannot be built up in their character, and the church cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this matter the two Western brothers truly needed our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we were unable to help them in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that we have no discernment concerning matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, because of this, our work here cannot build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we take care of the needy brothers and sisters, we must consider whether our care is for their building up or for their tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This depends on our ability to discern things.</S>
