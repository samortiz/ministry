A later book under the same title The New Covenant is an edited and expanded version of these messages.)</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>Today we will speak on God's grace and how it is manifested in the new covenant. Many people today do not understand the new covenant. The new covenant does not have any power in them. For this conference I have looked to God to give me the message that I should preach. The initial burden I had was on the new covenant. Since then, this message has been growing stronger and stronger in me. This message is a central truth; it is the truth that the Lord has committed to us. Today our message will be on the new covenant.</P><P>Every Christian, whether he is a worker or not, whether he is a beginner or has walked a long way, must know what the new covenant is in his experience. Unfortunately, if you ask ten Christians about the new covenant, probably nine of them will not be able to answer you. Try this for yourself. The new covenant is the basis of everything. Our sins are forgiven because we have the covenant. We have the strength to obey God and bear a proper testimony because we have the covenant. We thank God that this covenant is not our covenant, but God's covenant. Our sins can be forgiven, and we can have the strength to obey God, testify, and accomplish what He has committed to us because of the covenant He has enacted. Moreover, we can rest in His covenant.</P><P>If a tailor cannot use his scissors and needles skillfully, or even worse, does not know anything about them, he cannot be a tailor. If a carpenter cannot use his saw and chisel, he cannot be a carpenter. If a cook does not know how to prepare a dish, he cannot be a good cook. Similarly, if a Christian does not know about the new covenant in his experience, he will not be able to accomplish God's purpose. It would be an impossible thing to do.</P><P>One thing that comforts our hearts is that even though the new covenant is a truth that many have forgotten, it is not a truth that is opposed by them. Many truths are not wrong, yet they are opposed. Many other truths can be understood, but they are forgotten. The new covenant is a very easily forgotten truth, but it is not a truth that is rejected by men. For this reason, we can take some comfort.</P><P>Some have said that our Bible is composed of the New and Old Testaments. Strictly speaking, however, the Bible cannot be called the New and Old Testaments. The terms New Testament and Old Testament were made up by the Protestant reformers. They were not the original name of the Bible. Actually, the New Testament is within the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is within the New Testament. The Lord Jesus called the Bible the "Scripture." He always said, "Thus says the Scripture." We have gone along with men's habitual usage and called it the Old and New Testaments. Although it is not so good to call the Bible the Old and New Testaments, the reformers, nevertheless, have given us some light in distinguishing the old covenant from the new covenant.</P><P>There was a famous Englishman who was called the "sweetest soul in the world." What made him so distinguished was the letters he wrote. Once he wrote in a letter: </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Satan may have a great deal of water, but I have the fire. If we engage in a war in the air, the water and fire will clash and it will be just like thunder. I will not be afraid at all because I know that the fire belongs to Christ. As long as I put the fire in His hand, He will be responsible for keeping the coal burning.</P><P>This is dealing with Christ on the ground of the covenant. He did not beg, and he did not pray. There was no struggling and striving. He had absolute confidence and was not afraid at all. Even when the warfare was like thunder, he was still not afraid. He knew that Christ was responsible for the fire and for everything. This brother knew what a covenant is.</P><P>Mr. A. M. Toplady, who wrote the hymn "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me," had tuberculosis of the lungs for over ten years. When he was very ill, he wrote a hymn. One of the stanzas says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Resting in the Lord's faithfulness-<br>How sweet it is!<br>For His love is truly wonderful.<br>Resting in the Lord's gracious covenant-<br>How sweet!<br>For His covenant is forever dependable.</P><P>Unfortunately, many people do not know how to live on earth by the Lord's faithfulness and the Lord's covenant. Although we may know that the Lord's grace is sufficient for us and the Lord's love can satisfy our hearts, there are other things which we know nothing about, such as God's faithfulness and His covenant. I will speak on faithfulness and the covenant today. The above-mentioned brother shows us that we do not rest only in God's love, but also in His covenant.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
