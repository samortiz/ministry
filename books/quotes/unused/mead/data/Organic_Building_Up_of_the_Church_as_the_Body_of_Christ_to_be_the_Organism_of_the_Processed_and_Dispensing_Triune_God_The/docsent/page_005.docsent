   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This organism of the Triune God is the organic Body of Christ constituted with His many brothers as the many members of His organic Body Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The intrinsic essence of the church as the organic Body of Christ is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is by this intrinsic essence that the church can be held together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our oneness is not in agreeing with one another s doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our oneness is the processed and dispensing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah for this oneness!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have any problems with one another, it is because we have departed from the intrinsic essence, the processed and dispensing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we stay with Him, forgetting all the different doctrines, there will be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE ORGANIC EXISTENCE OF THE CHURCH Existing in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>as the One Universal Church of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>for His Universal Expression, the Fullness of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church exists in the universe as the one universal church of God for His universal expression, the fullness of God 1 Cor 10:32; 12:28; Eph 3:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the existence of the church is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where the Triune God is, this living, organic church is, because this church is now one with the processed and dispensing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church and the processed and dispensing Triune God are not two entities; they have become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible for such a church to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spreading in Many Localities on the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>as Many Local Churches to Be</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His Local Expressions</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is spreading in many localities on the earth as many local churches to be His local expressions Rev 1:4a; 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Universally, the church exists in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Locally, this church is expressed in many localities as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To say that all the local expressions should be different from one another is a wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of erroneous teaching comes from not seeing that the churches are organic, with an intrinsic essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Does the church in Anaheim have a particular, intrinsic essence different from the church in another locality?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the time of Peter and Paul, every local church had the same one intrinsic essence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the local churches on the earth today also have only one intrinsic essence, so the church cannot be divided, or split.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only the universal church but also the local churches are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are intrinsically one in the processed and dispensing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To solve our problems today, we must come back to the intrinsic essence of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If today we all limit ourselves to the one intrinsic essence of the church, every problem will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To talk about whether all the churches are one or separate is to talk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is talk without a vision of the intrinsic essence of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This chapter should be used by the Lord to open the window for us to look into and see the very intrinsic essence of the church and all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says, And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, God placed the apostles, who are universal in function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, He placed the prophets, who are not just universal in function because prophets were a part of the church in Antioch Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Third, He placed teachers, who were also present locally in Antioch Acts 13:1 .</S>
