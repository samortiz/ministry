Acts 13:18-22 says, "And for a time of about forty years He carried them as a nurse in the wilderness. And when He had overthrown seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance. And after these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. And afterward they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king." (David was king for forty years&mdash;2 Sam. 5:4.) How many years were there from the exodus to the fourth year of King Solomon when he built the temple? It was forty plus four hundred fifty plus forty plus forty, which equals five hundred seventy. If we add the three years prior to the building of the temple, we have five hundred seventy-three years. Yet 1 Kings 6:1 says, "And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord." This verse says four hundred eighty years rather than five hundred seventy-three years&mdash;a difference of ninety-three years! Why is there such a great difference? Is Acts wrong or is 1 Kings wrong? No, both records are right. A spiritual principle is involved in the discrepancy between the two numbers. In Acts, the record of the forty years in the wilderness is correct, the record of the forty years of Saul's reign is correct, and the record of the forty years of David is also correct. The temple was built in the fourth year of Solomon's reign; therefore, it is right to add three years to that period. The discrepancy is in the four-hundred-fifty-year period. First Kings has ninety-three years less than Acts. Where did these ninety-three years go? In studying Judges, we discover a fact: During that period, the Israelites were subdued by heathen tribes several times. Let us see how many years they were under oppression.</p><p>Judges 3:8 says, "Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years." This was the first period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for eight years. Verse 14 says, "And the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years." This was the second period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for eighteen years. Judges 4:2-3 says, "And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. And the captain of his army was Sisera, who dwelt at Harosheth-hagoyim. And the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the children of Israel severely twenty years." This was the third period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for twenty years. Judges 6:1 says, "Then the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years." This was the fourth period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for seven years. Judges 13:1 says, "Then the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years." This was the fifth period of oppression the Israelites suffered; this bondage under the Philistines lasted for forty years. How many years were there in the five periods of oppression by the heathen tribes? There were eight plus eighteen plus twenty plus seven plus forty. How many years were there? There were exactly ninety-three years, no more and no less. Now we understand the discrepancy between the records in 1 Kings and Acts. In Acts, Paul was speaking about history; therefore, he included the ninety-three years. The emphasis in 1 Kings is on the condition of the Israelites before the Lord, and the ninety-three years were not counted. This is why it says four hundred eighty years.</p><p>It is very meaningful that ninety-three years were not counted. These years were lost years. Whenever the Israelites lost their freedom, served heathen tribes, and did not have a judge, their days were not reckoned. The Israelites belonged to God; they were saved from Egypt already. Whenever they were subdued by their enemies and became slaves, whenever they were in bondage, and whenever they could not serve God freely, their days were not counted. When they served something other than God, their days were lost and not counted in God's sight. Brothers and sisters, we should consider how many of the days since we were saved have been counted before the Lord. Perhaps we have believed in the Lord for eight or ten years. How many days during these years have we lived foolishly? How many days in the past have been struck out? We have too many wasted days! I doubt whether the days that can be counted before the Lord add up to a year. We must realize that the days that we live according to man's desire, the days that we live apart from God, and the days of failure and decline are not counted in God's eyes. We have been Christians for many years. Let us ask ourselves, "How many of these days have we wasted? How many of these days can be counted?" Every day that is not lived in fellowship with God is a lost day. Therefore brothers and sisters, we must all redeem the time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
