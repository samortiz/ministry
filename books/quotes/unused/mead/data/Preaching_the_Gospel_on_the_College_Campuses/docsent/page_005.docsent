   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some of you may have been saved for less than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may think that you are too young, that you do not know very much, and that you do not have much experience in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not listen to these thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have seen many newly saved ones who were bold, strong, and powerful in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have also seen ones who became old in their experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they preached the gospel, they did not have any power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they turned to gimmicks and exercised their cleverness to convince people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You do not need to use crafty words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as you are in the Spirit, you should be frank and strict with your words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once in my hometown, someone came to me and said, "Brother Lee, your gospel preaching is very good, but you should not be so frank and strict in your speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I told him that although he was nice in his gospel preaching, he had not brought many people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Should I have learned from him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I may not have seemed nice in my gospel preaching, but I brought many people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The effectiveness of the gospel is not a matter of being nice and crafty or even frank and bold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who exercise their faith to preach the gospel in the baptism in the Spirit have power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today the power is in your faith and your faith has a base, a ground, and a standing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The base is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not need to use any gimmicks when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should just exercise our faith to apply the word of the truth which says that we have been baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You do not even need to claim the baptism in the Spirit in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Simply apply the accomplished fact of the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever I get home, I take out my key and apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The key has been made and it is ready to be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not need to say, "Oh, I claim the key.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The key is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The key was made for me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The key has been given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The key is waiting for me."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I could claim the key in this way from morning to evening and still be outside my door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I just need to take the key out of my pocket and apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you go to the campus, just apply the Spirit by exercising your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Make a strong decision that you will not do anything without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the morning, when you are going to the campus, exercise your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can say, "Lord, thank You, the Spirit is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in me because the Bible tells me so."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all have to be rescued from the concept that we need gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This thought has to go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need any gimmicks like rock music, movies, or dramas.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The demons are not afraid of gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The demons are afraid of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we exercise our faith, we will have the power to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, the seven Spirits are for the seven churches and for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seven Spirits have also been sent forth into the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should exercise our faith to tell the Lord, "Lord, I am in the churches, I am for Your administration, and I am for the preaching of the gospel, the sending forth of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will give us the standing to apply the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament tells us that Christ has been crucified and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has ascended to the heavens, and He has baptized all of His chosen people in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us believe in the Word, exercise our faith, and go to the campuses to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let me say a balancing word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must love the Lord and His Word, forsake sinful matters, open ourselves to be fully cleansed, and consecrate ourselves to the Lord, or our faith will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will not have a living faith because we do not have a good conscience 1 Tim 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever there is an offense in our conscience, there will be a leakage, and our faith will leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have a bad conscience, we will not be able to exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if we love the Lord and His Word, deal with all our sins with a thorough confession, apply the blood to our situation, and consecrate ourselves to the Lord, our faith will work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A strong and prevailing faith always comes from a good conscience without offense.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not need to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we need to confess and consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we can apply what the Bible says by exercising our faith.</S>
