   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF MATURITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are God's farm 1 Cor 3:9, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>, and as God's farm we may have at least three different stages of harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who ripen early will be harvested first by the Lord and will be the overcomers as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These will be taken by the Lord to the throne of God in the third heavens for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most will be left in the field for another length of time to ripen before they are harvested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A few who are on the edge of the church life, in the corners of the field, will be left until the last.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The type of this kind of harvest is found in Exodus 23 and Leviticus 23.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The partial fulfillment is in Matthew 13, and the complete fulfillment is in Revelation 14.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There we find the firstfruit and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the description in Revelation 14, the firstfruit are the saints who are saturated with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are the ones who have been fully occupied with Christ and taken over by Christ until they are matured.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My heart aches for many of the Lord's children who seem to be somewhat ignorant, careless, and dull concerning the need to be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How serious it is that we are God's farm, God's crop!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no doubt that we are wheat, but how mature are we?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Will we be the firstfruit or the harvest or the gleanings?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I beg you to take this word seriously and to bring this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By such a reaping of God's crop which we call the rapture, the Lord Jesus will transfer the reality of the kingdom into the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 13:43 says, "Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The righteous ones here are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will be raptured and transferred into the Father's kingdom to become the shining ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE PRINCIPLES AS A WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not be tempted to be curious concerning all the details of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What the Lord reveals to us is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle is that the Lord's crop, His wheat, needs to be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who are matured will be taken first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then after the firstfruit will come the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need for us to figure out the time that the firstfruit will be taken away and the time that the harvest will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Don't try to understand the Bible in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord reveals to us, not the details, but the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The details would require tens of thousands of pages to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not need the details, but we do need to pick up the help from the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So forget about your curiosity, but pick up the principles as a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to pick up the warning and to realize that we need to be mature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to pray, "Lord, have mercy upon me that I would be a part of the firstfruit, and that I would be an overcomer."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pray that you will be a wise virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Pray that the Lord will save you from being a foolish virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not try to pick up the details.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather pick up some living, unveiling, revealing, stirring, and encouraging word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, you may be clear about some of the details, but miss the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may miss being an overcomer although you are clear about some of the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Pick up the principle to receive the warning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not be ensnared by the desire to have the knowledge concerning the details.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to see God's purpose and intention, and we need to see our responsibility to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to enjoy Christ, to participate in Him, and to take Him in until we are matured.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, He will be expressed as our marriage garment, and we will be qualified to be co-kings with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not take all these points in order to systematize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord preserve us so that we will simply care for the pure and real revelation of the principles as a warning.</S>
