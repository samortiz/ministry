   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE WORD AND OUR FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In previous chapters we have said that a minister of the word needs four things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two of these things, light and the inner words, are of God, while the other two, thoughts and memory, are of the minister himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before a minister of the word opens his mouth to speak, he needs to have two things available to him his own thoughts and his memory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While he is speaking, he also needs two more things proper feelings and a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SPIRIT BEING RELEASED THROUGH FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In reading the Bible, we find one outstanding feature in all the writers of the books: Their feelings were never a hindrance to them in their ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In their speaking, they expressed their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must realize that the release of our spirit often is affected by our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a man s feelings cannot be expressed, his spirit cannot be freed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not a man s spirit is released has very little to do with the will or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It has much to do with the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spirit is mainly expressed through our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When our feelings become a hindrance, the spirit is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When our feelings are cold, the spirit becomes cold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When our feelings are dry, the spirit is dry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When our feelings are calm, the spirit is calm.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why do God s children so often confuse the spirit with feelings?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s children can most readily discern the spirit from the will because there is a great difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They can discern the spirit from the mind because this difference is also great.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But it is not easy to discern the spirit from feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is easy to confuse the two because the spirit does not flow independently; when it flows, it carries feelings with it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit does not express itself through the mind or the will but through the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason that many people find it difficult to differentiate between the spirit and the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the two are totally different, the spirit being one thing and the feelings another, the spirit is nevertheless expressed through the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The light bulb is the place where electricity is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although electricity and the bulb are two different things, the two cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, the spirit and the feelings are two different things, yet the former is expressed through the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason we cannot separate the spirit from the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this does not mean that the spirit is the feelings or that the feelings are the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For those who have never learned the spiritual lessons, the spirit and the feelings are one and the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is like some people who consider that electricity is the same as the light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In reality, electricity and light bulbs are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a minister of the word speaks, his spirit has to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the release of the spirit is related very much to his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If his feelings are not proper, his spirit cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The electricity in the power company can be very strong, but without a light bulb no light will be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, no matter how wonderful our spirit is, the spirit is frustrated if our feelings are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The spirit is released through the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order for the spirit of the minister of the word to be free, it must have suitable feelings to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the feelings do not obey the spirit or follow its instructions, the spirit is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the purpose of releasing the spirit, a man must have proper feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now let us consider the kind of feelings that are proper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man has a will, but the will is the coarsest part within him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man also has a mind, which is more refined than the will, yet the mind is still coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man also has feelings, which are the most delicate part in him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a man makes a decision, he may do so in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though man is capable of thinking, his thoughts are not necessarily refined.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in man s emotions and feelings, we can find a soft and tender spot.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament, particularly in the Song of Songs, the finer parts of man are signified by scents.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Scents can only be detected by the nose, and the sense of smell is a very delicate function.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Smell represents the finer sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible uses the nose as a symbol of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although man s feelings are delicate, not all feelings can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A minister of the word has to use his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every time he speaks, he has to put his feelings into the words he is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without this, his words are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before a minister of the word opens his mouth, he must have memory and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after he opens his mouth, he first should have feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If his feelings cannot match his speaking, his speaking amounts to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus once illustrated this point to His disciples, saying, But to what shall I liken this generation?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn Matt 11:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a man has feelings, he will dance when others play the flute and mourn when others sing a dirge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, a minister of the word cannot speak one thing but feel just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This altogether disqualifies a person from speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot speak a word of grief without having any feeling of grief.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do not have the feeling of grief, we cannot be a minister of such a word of grief.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The feelings that we are speaking of are not a kind of performance.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Any performed feeling is an imitation; it is like acting in a play.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A minister of the word should not perform his speaking in an artificial way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a minister of the word speaks, he should be full of feelings for the words he is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Every word of his should be full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the words are sorrowful, he should feel sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the spirit is sad, the feelings should be sad as well.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some words are joyous, and he should feel joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the spirit is joyful, he should have the feelings of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must remember that it is not enough to just release the word; the spirit must be released as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, when the spirit is released, it conveys our feelings also.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, if our feelings are not up to the standard, our words will be short of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When our feelings are too rough, they are useless in the release of the words.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The feelings are the most delicate part of man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If our feelings are rough and insensitive, we cannot use them, and our speaking will be without the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whatever words we are speaking, we must have the spirit to match the words.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the spirit is different from the words, the two become incompatible, and the words will suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The result will be nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we release certain words, we have to convey a certain spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In other words, we need the proper spirit for the proper words.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot speak one kind of word while having another kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>No one can be a minister in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The kind of spirit we have must match the kind of word we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But when the spirit is released, it cannot express itself; it must be accompanied by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If our feelings are unusable, or if they are heading in a different direction from that of our spirit, the spirit is unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Hence, our spirit must match God s word, and our feelings must also match God s word.</S>
