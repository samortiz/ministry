As the Ascended Victor, Sharing the Spoil<br>with God for His Triumphant Glory</H2><P>Fourth, the prophets' report and Jehovah's revelation unveil Christ as the ascended Victor. Christ is the incarnated Savior, the crucified Redeemer, the resurrected Life-giver, and the ascended Victor.</P><P>Isaiah 53:12a says, "Therefore, I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong." The mentioning of spoil, or prey, here indicates Christ's victory. In His ascension, Christ shared the captured ones with the Great and the Strong. In the whole universe, only God is great and only God is strong. God is also the real Victor; He has gained all the spoil. He and this ascended Victor, Christ, shared the captured ones as the spoil. Ephesians 4:8-12 tells us that when Christ ascended to the height, He led captive those who were taken captive by Satan. We were sinners captured by Satan, but through His death and resurrection, Christ overcame Satan, and He captured all those who were held captive by Satan. These captives eventually became Christ's captives, and they are the prey, the spoil. Christ brought all these captured captives to the heavens and presented them to the Father. Then the Father shared this spoil with Christ, the ascended Victor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Jehovah Dividing to Him a Portion with the Great,<br>and He Dividing the Spoil with the Strong</H2><P>Isaiah 53:12 says, "Therefore, I [Jehovah] will divide to Him [Jehovah's Servant] a portion with the Great [God], / And He [Jehovah's Servant] will divide the spoil with the Strong [God]; / Because He poured out His life unto death / And was numbered with the transgressors, / Yet He bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors." The first part of this verse says that Jehovah will divide to His Servant a portion with the Great, that is, with God, and Jehovah's Servant will divide the spoil with the Strong, that is, with God. The second part of the verse gives the reason why God would do this: because He, Jehovah's Servant, poured out His life unto death, volunteering to die to be such an offering, and was numbered with the transgressors, yet He alone bore the sin of many and interceded for the transgressors. Because Christ did all these things, He is now qualified to share the spoil. The victory was gained by God through Christ's volunteering to die, through Christ's being willing to be numbered among the transgressors. When Christ was crucified, on His left and on His right two criminals were crucified with Him (Luke 23:32-33). Thus, He was numbered among these wicked ones. That was a shame to Him. Christ suffered all this, and He also bore the sin of many. On the cross, Christ bore our sins (1 Pet. 2:24a). Because of all these things God counted Him worthy to share the spoil of the spiritual war on this earth. God counted Him as the Victor.</P><P>All the recounting, all the reporting, and all the revelation in this portion of the Word are in the New Testament economy. In Isaiah 53 Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is unveiled in the New Testament way. When we read the Old Testament through without reading Isaiah 53, we receive the impression of the Old Testament economy. But when we come to Isaiah 53 and read it, the flavor, the taste, is altogether of the New Testament, not the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, Isaiah 53 is the unique chapter that bears the color, the taste, and the atmosphere of the New Testament.</P><P>I trust in the Lord that He will cause us all to understand these things, not in a natural way but in the unveiled, revealed way, that we may know Christ as such a One. The view of Christ in Isaiah 53 is absolutely different from the human view. We all need to believe Isaiah's report concerning Christ. We need to be enlightened so that we may have the right view and receive the revelation to know Jesus Christ in the God-ordained economy, that is, the New Testament economy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_258.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_260.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 259</div><br></body></html>
