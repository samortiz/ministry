   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son of God Designated in Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>according to the Spirit of Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>out of the Resurrection of the Dead in His Divinity 1 Designated the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Jews recognized the Lord s status as the seed of David according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of them admitted that Jesus was a royal descendant of David Matt 1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 21:9, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, regarding the Lord s status as the Son of God, there was a great controversy among the Jews when He was on the earth Mark 2:5-7; John 6:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day the Lord Jesus asked His disciples a question, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets v. 14 . This indicates that the Jews debated among themselves concerning His person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without heavenly revelation they could realize, at most, only that He was the greatest among the prophets; none of them could know that He is the Son of the living God v. 16 . Eventually, the Jews condemned Him to death because He claimed that He was the Son of God 26:63-66; 27:43; Mark 14:61-64; Luke 22:70; John 5:18; 9:35-37 . For the Jewish leaders, to declare oneself as the Son of God was blasphemy 10:30-33, 36 . They thought that Christ was blaspheming God because they believed that He was not the Son of God but merely a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before His incarnation and resurrection, Christ was already the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After He became incarnate, however, His divine nature was concealed by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, according to Romans 1:4, when He entered into resurrection, He was designated in power as the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unlike the resurrection of Lazarus John 11:41-44 and of others Luke 7:11-17; 8:49-54 , the resurrection of Christ was not common but very particular.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ s resurrection is different because His resurrection was His designation as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was no need for Christ to be designated as the Son of Man, because when people saw Him, they immediately recognized that He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, there was a need for Him to be designated the Son of God because the Son of God was concealed in Him as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His divinity was concealed in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People could easily recognize His humanity, but not His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This concealed divinity needed to be designated, made manifest, by the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was resurrected, He was designated, or manifested, the Son of God with His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before His incarnation, Christ, the divine One, already was the Son of God John 1:18; Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His resurrection was His designation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By incarnation He brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, who possesses both divinity and humanity, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons Rom 8:29-30 we who have believed in and received His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We too will be designated and revealed as the sons of God, as He was in the glory of His resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>19, 21 , and with Him we will express God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 According to the Spirit of Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ as the seed of David according to the flesh was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of holiness in 1:4 is in contrast with the flesh in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as the flesh in verse 3 refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in verse 4 does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit but to the spiritual essence of Christ s divinity, that is, the divine essence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ became a man and thereby put on humanity, He did not give up His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He came to be a man in His divinity, and that divinity is the Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Christ was on the earth, He was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to His humanity, He was the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to His divinity, He was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is therefore one person of two natures, the divine nature and the human nature; the human nature is the flesh, and the divine nature is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus divinity is the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This divinity, being the Spirit of holiness Himself, has the divine power and the divine element to transform Christ s humanity, thereby making it divine.</S>
