<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JUDGMENT</H1><P>Some think that when the last day comes there will only be a general judgment for all. They assume that whether they are Jews, Gentiles, believers, sinners, sheep, or goats, they will all come before God the Father to be set on the left or right. But there is no such doctrine in God's Word! The Bible records several judgments, not just one. The persons judged, the place and time of judgment, and the basis of judgment are all different in these judgments.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>The sins of the believers have been judged:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Time: A.D. 33</li>		<li>Place: The cross (John 19:17-18)</li>		<li>Basis: The death of Christ (Rom. 5:8; 1 Cor. 15:3)</li>		<li>Result: The believers made righteous (1 Pet. 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The work of the believers will be judged:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Time: 1 Cor. 4:5; Luke 14:14; 2 Tim. 4:8</li>		<li>Place: "In the air" (1 Thes. 4:16-17)</li>		<li>Basis: "Each one's work" (1 Cor. 3:13)</li>		<li>Result: "Reward" or "loss," but "he himself will be saved" (1 Cor. 3:14-15)</li>			</ol></li>	<li>The nations will be judged:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Time: "When the Son of Man comes" (Matt. 25:31-32)</li>		<li>Place: "The valley of Jehoshaphat" (Joel 3:2, 12, 14)</li>		<li>Basis: "My brothers" (Matt. 25:40)</li>		<li>Result: (Matt. 25:46)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The dead will be judged:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Time: "He has set a day" (Acts 17:31)			<ol class="decimal">			<li>One thousand years after the first resurrection (Rev. 20:5, 7)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Place: "A great white throne" (Rev. 20:11)</li>		<li>Basis: "The things which were written in the scrolls" (Rev. 20:12)</li>		<li>Result: (Rev. 20:15)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Table of Comparison between III. and IV.</H2><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" width="450"><tr><td style="font-weight:bold" width="225">The Judgment of the Nations</td><td style="font-weight:bold" width="225">The Judgment of the Dead</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1.No resurrection</td><td valign="top">1.One resurrection</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.The living nations judged</td><td valign="top">2.The dead being judged</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3.On earth</td><td valign="top">3.The heavens and the earth passed away</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.No scrolls</td><td valign="top">4.Scrolls opened</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5.Three kinds of people:<br>sheep, goats, and brothers</td><td valign="top">5.Only one kind of people:<br>the dead</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6.At the time of Christ's<br>appearing</td><td valign="top">6.One thousand years after<br>Christ begins to reign</td></tr></table></div><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Remarks</H2><P>The Word of God teaches us that the works of the believers are judged by disciplining (1 Cor. 11:31-32), as a father deals with sons (Heb. 12:6-7). Compare 2 Samuel 7:14-15 with 12:13-14.</P><P>The Bible also teaches us concerning the judgment of the angels (1 Cor. 6:3; 2 Pet. 2:4; Gen 6:2-4; cf. Jude 6).</P>
