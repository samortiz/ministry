   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God created us without the element of holiness, but He intended to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to make us holy, God had to take a second step after the first step of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God had to take a second step to make the new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before I was saved, I was a part of the old creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God was not in me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But one day when I was nineteen years old, I turned to God and opened up myself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that moment God sowed Himself into me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God planted Himself as a small seed into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The holy nature of God came into me as a small seed, and that seed is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would like to give a testimony as an example of the growth of God's holy nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was young, I was fond of playing soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A few years after I got saved, I was playing soccer, and the ball came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When it reached me, I stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I could not kick the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Something within me turned away, so I walked off the playing field.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People wondered what happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may have thought I was sick, but I was not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The living, holy seed of the divine nature had been growing within me, and this living, organic divine nature did not agree to kick the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I wanted to kick the ball, but another element within me, another person within me, would not go along with me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, I had to go along with Him, so I walked off the playing field.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christian life is not a matter of outward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We live the Christian life by something organic growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By the growth of the seed of holiness within me, I was sanctified from playing soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From that day, when I walked off the playing field about sixty years ago, I never played soccer again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is not a verse in the Bible that says Christians should not play soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the One who was growing in me would not play soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wanted to play, but He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the growing of the holy God within me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us to be holy, and verse 5 says that in choosing us, He predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did God predestinate us?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why did God put a mark on us to indicate that we belong to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is because God wanted not only to make us holy as He is but also to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could God make us His sons?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God made us His sons not by adopting us but by begetting us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He made us His sons by sowing His seed, His divine life, into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His divine life was sown into our being along with His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This divine life, after getting into us, begets us to make us the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were not adopted by God, but we were begotten by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of His begetting, we all have become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now what is within us?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For holiness, the nature of God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For sonship, the life of God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I had been reading Ephesians for many years, but I did not see this until recently.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day I saw that Ephesians 1:4 and 5 show the dispensing of God's holy nature into us and the dispensing of God's life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are human beings, but we have the divine nature and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to declare, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have the holy nature of God, so I am holy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have the divine life, so I am divine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am a divine son of God with His divine life and His holy nature!"</S>
