   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thoroughly Examining the Information Cards</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to recover these brothers and sisters, our initial plan is to thoroughly examine the existing information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among the fifty thousand names in the church in Taipei, about ten thousand of the addresses are accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of this number, there are approximately five to six thousand saints who participate in the church life regularly and about six thousand more who come to an occasional meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, we have accurate address information for these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The information regarding these six thousand saints who occasionally meet has been distributed to each small group; this is a very good situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to begin by recovering the brothers and sisters who seldom attend meetings but whose whereabouts are known.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This involves a work of visitation and restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also need to locate the nearly forty thousand saints whose whereabouts are unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very time consuming, and we are in the process of looking for a way that the churches in Taiwan can coordinate with each other in order to find these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have begun by distributing these information cards to each small group so that they can at least go to the addresses that are listed on the cards.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a way for us to begin to restore these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Receiving the Burden to Go Out and Visit</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The key to recovering these saints is for the brothers and sisters who regularly meet in the small groups to receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without a burden, it will be difficult to move; with a burden, there will be grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need a burden to visit eight or nine, not just one or two.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On average, each saint needs to be willing to contact at least eight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a great and difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, I want to encourage you with one statistic: when the number of saints attending the meetings increases to forty thousand, approximately one out of every thirty people in Taipei will be one of our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will make it quite easy for us to penetrate every social level with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will have brothers and sisters in every trade and profession, whether accountants, business owners, army generals, university professors, homemakers, or taxi drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Strengthening the Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and Praying Desperately</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our testimony needs to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The saints who are wandering outside are scattered and not enjoying the riches of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are truly like the prodigal son who could not find even carob pods to eat Luke 15:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the Father s house, in God s house, which is the church, the food is plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must be compassionate toward them and bring them home to enjoy the riches in the Father s house with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before going out, we need to pray thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can absolutely testify to the effectiveness of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1932, when the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, I could see the effectiveness of our prayer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord would bring people in ways that were quite wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to believe that our concern matches the Lord s concern on the throne; in fact, His concern has touched us to be concerned for others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, we must receive a burden to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the beginning we may not know the names of the ones who need to be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may only know that there are forty to fifty thousand who need our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can tell the Lord, Remember these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that if two to three thousand pray daily, the Lord will hear our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Along with prayer, we will distribute the information cards according to geographic regions, and we will encourage the saints to fellowship in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, we can say to one another, This sister has not been to a meeting for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do we know a sister who is close to her and who could go and visit her?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If no one knows her, we could ask, Is there anyone who is willing to receive a burden to go to her?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since each card contains details related to age, family situation, parents, and children, we will be able to fellowship about a saint s particular condition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With such fellowship, some will receive a burden to go and visit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE PRINCIPLE OF VISITING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Visiting dormant saints needs much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not do it properly, we will drive them further away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our visiting will only drive them further away, it would be better not to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When saints ask me what they should do when they visit, it is difficult to give a specific answer because I have found that my ways do not always work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Having a Praying and Learning Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider the example of boxing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A teacher may teach boxing in the classroom in one way, but when it comes to the actual boxing match, the teacher s instructions may not work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In a boxing match, one has to make adjustments according to the actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consequently, the most important matter in visiting is to have a praying and learning spirit, saying, O Lord, only You can restore this one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>None of us can do this in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those with no experience will certainly face difficulties, but even those with experience cannot rely on what they have learned in the past, because every person s situation is different.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must look to the Lord, praying, Have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Give me the wisdom and the words I need to speak.</S>
