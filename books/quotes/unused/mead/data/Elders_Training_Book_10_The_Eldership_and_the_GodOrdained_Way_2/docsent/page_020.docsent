   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Father's Name by His Divine Life In the Father's Name</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The oneness of the Body is the oneness of all the believers in Christ in the Father's name John 17:2, 6, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be in the Father's name is to be in the Father's person, for in the New Testament, the name always denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, to be in the Father's name is to be in the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the sense of the New Testament, the Father always bears the denotation of the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The father of a family is the source of the life of that family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 17:11 the Lord prayed that the believers would be one in the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be one in the Father's name is to be one in the very source of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the Father's Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This oneness is also by the Father's divine life and with the Father's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we have the Father's life, we also have the Father's nature, for the nature always goes along with the life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have the Father's person as the source of the genuine oneness, and we have the Father's divine life with His divine nature as the very element of this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are the intrinsic contents of the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>in the Triune God through Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>by the Reality of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word John 17:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the portion of His prayer in verses 14-21, the Lord referred to the word and to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word sanctifies, and the truth sanctifies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the word and the truth are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word contains and bears the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This word, which is the truth, sanctifies God's redeemed people from the world v. 17 and keeps them from the ruler of the world, the evil one v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 17:21 the Lord prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word Us here refers to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows that the oneness of the believers is in the Triune God, which means that the believers are mingled with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The believers could not be one without being mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the Triune God is the very base and element of our oneness.</S>
