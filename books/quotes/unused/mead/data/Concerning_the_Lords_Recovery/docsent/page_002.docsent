   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word recovery means that something was there originally, and then was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So there is the need to bring that thing back to its original state.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word recovery is somewhat simple and not too profound, but when we speak of the Lord's recovery we need to apply it to the revelation of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From this point of view the Lord's recovery is a profound and crucial thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense the revelation of the entire Bible is a revelation of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GOD'S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First of all the Bible unveils to us clearly concerning God's intention, God's purpose, and God's aim.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible shows us that God had an intention, a purpose, with a goal as His aim.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we don't have a clear vision of what God wants, what God desires to have, what God's intention is. we cannot know what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So we need to see God's intention, God's purpose, God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD'S ACCOMPLISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible gives a clear picture not only of God's intention, but also of God's accomplishment according to His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, God purposed, and then God came in to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apparently, the Old Testament is simply a history of a number of great men plus a people, the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But actually the history of those great individuals and the nation of Israel is just the history of God's accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the New Testament has a history.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, there is a history of a man by the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is a wonderful Person whose history needs four books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The four Gospels are the history of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then from Acts to the end of the New Testament there is the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So the whole Bible, including the Old Testament and the New Testament is a history book concerning God's accomplishment, God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD'S ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, the Bible also gives us a clear record of how God's enemy came in to destroy what God had accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Satanic way to destroy God's accomplishment has two aspects: the inward and the outward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The inward aspect is to ruin God's people, to make God's chosen people rotten and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament after God had accomplished His purpose, Satan came in to ruin the children of Israel so that they became corrupt and rotten within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then Satan came in to destroy God's accomplishment outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The temple, which was the expression of God, was destroyed, and God's chosen people were carried into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that whatever God had accomplished was gone.</S>
