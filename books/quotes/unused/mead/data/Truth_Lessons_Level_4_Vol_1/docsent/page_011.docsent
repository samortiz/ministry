   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A PROPHET RAISED UP BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Old Testament prophet Moses prophesied that Christ would come as a Prophet raised up by God Deut 18:15-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 15 Moses said to the children of Israel, A Prophet will Jehovah your God raise up for you from your midst.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses indicated that God would give Him, the Prophet, the words that He ought to speak and that He would speak to God s people all that God commanded Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 3:22-23 Peter quotes Moses words to indicate that Christ is the Prophet promised by God through Moses to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the fulfillment of this prophecy was confirmed in Acts 3:22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses said that this Prophet would be raised up from your midst.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that Christ as the coming Prophet would be human as well as divine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is God incarnated to be a man, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Christ were merely God, He could not have been raised up from among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, as the incarnated God, Christ put on human nature and became a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, He is the Prophet raised up from your midst, as prophesied by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ in His first coming was the Prophet raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He spoke the word of God John 1:14; 3:34; 7:16-17; Heb 1:2 and prophesied many things concerning God s economy, especially concerning the accomplishment of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was indeed a great Prophet in His first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ONE WHO DOES GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Psalm 40:6-8 David prophesied that Christ in His first coming was to do the will of God: You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/ Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me. / I delight in doing Your will, O My God; / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This prophecy is one of the greatest revelations concerning the commission of Christ in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Hebrews 10 Paul points out that in this portion of the Word Christ Himself prophesies that He would do God s will to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament economy God commanded His people to offer to Him sacrifices for sin and sins and offerings for fellowship .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when Jesus came, God no longer delighted in the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, God s will was to replace the sacrifices and offerings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the real sacrifice and offering; He is the reality of all the sacrifices and offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 40:6 says, You have prepared ears for Me. Prepared ears for Me is literally bored My ears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The boring of the slave s ears indicates that the master required the slave s obedience cf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Exo 21:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The obedience of Christ was for Him to be obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The obedience that God required of Christ was for Him to do the will of God by being the sacrifice and offering in His crucifixion in the body of His flesh Col 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, in Hebrews 10 Paul quotes the psalm according to the Septuagint: a body You have prepared for Me v. 5 . To bore the ears was for Christ s obedience to die on the cross, and to prepare a body was also for His dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, according to this prophecy, in His first coming through incarnation, Christ was to be the sacrifice and offering established by God on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He knew that God s delight was no longer in the sacrifices and offerings of the old covenant and that He would be their replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, He said to God, Behold, I have come / ...I delight in doing Your will Psa 40:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the One who does God s will, Christ fulfills and replaces all the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is to terminate God s Old Testament economy and to initiate and enact God s New Testament economy Matt 26:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>V. A GREAT LIGHT AND A LIGHT OF THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Isaiah 9:1-2 says, Gloom does not remain in the place where there was anguish: formerly He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali contemptibly, but afterward He treats the way of the sea, across the Jordan, with glory, Galilee of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The people who walked in the darkness / Have seen a great light; / Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death / Light has shined.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a prophecy concerning Christ in His first coming as a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew 4 speaks of the fulfillment of Isaiah s prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ left Jerusalem and came to Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light v. 16 . John the Baptist was a lamp that was burning and shining John 5:35 , but Christ was a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though at His birth Christ was a star, in His ministry He was a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said, I have come as a light into the world, that everyone who believes into Me would not remain in darkness 12:46 .</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Isaiah 9:1-2 the prophet Isaiah unveils Christ as the great light in a very beautiful and poetic way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Gloom, anguish, and contempt were in the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali Galilee of the nations because darkness was there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when the people who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death and walked in darkness met Christ, they saw the great light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This light shines upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide their feet into the way of peace Luke 1:78-79 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, Christ in His first coming as the great light was also for the release of people from their bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Isaiah 9:3 says, You have multiplied the nation; / You have increased their gladness; / They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest, / As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This prophecy refers to the increase, spread, and growth of Christ on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was fulfilled in the early apostles, such as Peter, John, and James, and it is also related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are the farmers in the harvest and the fighters dividing the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 4 says, For You break the yoke of their burden / And the staff on their shoulder, / The rod of their oppressor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that Christ as the great light breaks the yoke of the burden of the people of God so that they are released and their joy is increased.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Besides these points, in Isaiah 49:6 the prophet prophesied that God would send His servant, Christ, to be a light of the nations: I will also set You as a light of the nations / That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth cf.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>42:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This prophecy was fulfilled in Luke 2 when Joseph and Mary entered into the temple with the little child Jesus, and Simeon received Him into his arms and blessed God, saying, My eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>30-32 .</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is the divine, marvelous light to deliver the believers out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, into God s life-realm of light 1 Pet 2:9b; Acts 26:18a .</S>
