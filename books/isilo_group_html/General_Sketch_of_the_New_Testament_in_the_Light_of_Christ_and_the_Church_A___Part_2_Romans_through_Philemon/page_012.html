Adam stood in front of two trees, which represent or symbolize two parties-God and Satan. The tree of life represented God, Adam was there representing man, and Satan was there as well represented by the tree of knowledge. This clear picture shows us that both God and Satan became a choice to man. God Himself was there with Satan in front of man, and God gave man a volition to allow him to make a choice. Therefore, in the garden there are three parties, three wills, three lives, and three laws.<p>In the garden these three parties were individual and separated. God was God, Satan was Satan, and man was man; none of these three were mingled with the others. God&#8217;s intention was that man would receive Him as life. However, before man received God into him, Satan took the first step; he did something first. Man was seduced to take in Satan, Satan entered into man, and the two-man and Satan, Satan and man-were joined together illegally. Hence, Satan is within man as well as outside of him.<p>Some may feel that it is too much to say that Satan is in us. However, Ephesians 2:2 says, &#8220;You once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience.&#8221; Satan, the ruler of the authority of the air, is working in man. This is a proof that Satan is in fallen man. When did Satan enter into man? It was at the time that Adam took the fruit of the tree of knowledge. This is why the Bible tells us that fallen men are called the children of the devil and that Satan is the father of sinful man (1 John 3:10; John 8:44). When Satan entered into man, the satanic law of his evil life came with him.<p>In God&#8217;s salvation, He not only redeemed us, but also regenerated us. Redemption is a matter of the Lord shedding His blood, while regeneration is a matter of life. In God&#8217;s salvation there is not only the wonderful blood but also a wonderful life. On the negative side, blood is for redemption, while on the positive side, the divine life is for regeneration. Blood represents what the Lord has done for us, His work. Life represents what the Lord is to us, the Lord&#8217;s person. We believe in the Lord&#8217;s redemptive work by the blood, and we believe in His person as life to us. When we believe into Him in this way, we are redeemed on the negative side, and we are regenerated on the positive side. This means that our sins are forgiven, and we receive Him as life. In this way, He comes into us.<p>It is not difficult to prove in what part Satan came into us. Satan came into our physical body, because at the time of the fall Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge with his body and took it into his body. It is even less difficult to prove in what part the Lord came into us. We all know that the Lord comes into our human spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:16). In addition to these two lives, the human life is in the soul. Now we can see the site of each of the three different lives within us. The body is the site of the satanic life, the soul is the site of the human life, and the spirit is the site of the divine life. This is why Romans 7 and 8 tell us clearly that in the members of our body there is the law of sin, in the mind of the soul there is the law of good, and in the spirit there is the law of the divine life. Nothing could be clearer than this.<h2 class=head2>The Garden of Eden within Us</h2><p>The problem that we Christians face today is that there is a garden of Eden within us. All three parties were not only in the garden, but they now are in us, making us a miniature garden of Eden. In the ancient time there were three parties in the garden of Eden, and today the same parties are all within us. Within us there is the human life with the human will and the law of good. Within us there is also the satanic life with the satanic will and the satanic law. Furthermore, within us there is the divine life with the divine will and the divine law. Therefore, our story is the same as Adam&#8217;s. Even as God gave Adam a free will, a volition, to choose, He gives us the same volition and will with a choice.<p>If we want to go along with Satan, there is no need for us to go far away. If we choose to make friends with Satan, there is no need for a telephone call; he is close to us, even within us. Wherever we go, he always accompanies us; he never leaves us. Never think that Satan has ever left us. If we say this, we are deceived. The evil life of Satan is still in our members. One day Peter said something good to the Lord. However, he himself was not aware that Satan was in him. Therefore, the Lord turned and said to Peter, &#8220;Get behind Me, Satan!&#8221; (Matt. 16:23). Although we do not say that Satan is omnipresent, we must realize that he dwells in man&#8217;s flesh; this is a fact according to the Scriptures. Today Satan, the evil spirit, is working in mankind. As long as we are human beings, we are still in this fallen body, so we must be aware that the evil life with the evil law is still in us. However, although this evil thing is in our body, we still must praise and thank God that the divine life is in our spirit.<p>Since we are still in the body, we are very much related to the evil things. This is why we must daily and hourly rely on the Lord&#8217;s blood when we come to contact Him. Whether or not we sense that we are sinful or wrong, we still need the blood. In the Old Testament type, no one could go into the presence of the Lord without the shedding of blood. Whether we feel that we are sinful or holy, we still need the blood because we are still in this sinful body, the body of sin. Yet, we must praise the Lord because He also is in us! He is in us in an even deeper way.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
