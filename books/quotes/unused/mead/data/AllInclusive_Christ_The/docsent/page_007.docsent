   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR GOODNESS AND CHRIST S</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day a brother came to me, saying, It is rather difficult for me to understand the difference between our patience, and love and the patience and love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is our patience, and what is the patience of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is our love, and what is the love of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was not easy to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother, he continued, how can I know whether I am loving a person with my love or with the love of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I considered, and then I said to him, If the love with which you love others is the love of Christ, it is unlimited; it can never be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the love with which you love others is your own love, I am sure it will come to an end; there will be a limit to it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today you will love him, and tomorrow you will love him; in these things you will love him, and in those things you will love him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You will love him one day, the next day, and the third day; you will love him this month, this year, and next year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I am sure that the time will come when you will love him no longer; your love will be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a limit to human goodness, but the goodness of Christ is without limit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If your patience has a limit, that patience is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are patient with Christ s patience, the more wrongly you are treated, the more patient you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This patience can never be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is good in His unlimitedness; Christ is good in His spaciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With everything of Him, there is no limit and no change.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I think most of us have experienced or seen something of the problems between husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes I have seen a husband who appears to love his wife so much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can always predict that after five years this man will not love his wife; his love will be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the love of Christ can never be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you love your wife with the love of Christ, it will be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you love her with your own love, be assured that the more you love her today, the more you will hate her another day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord, we can love others with the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can say, Lord, it is not my love, but it is Your love, and Your love is Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I love others with Yourself, I love others in Yourself, and I love others through Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The dimensions of the love with which I love others are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That piece of land is good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is good in its spacious ness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no limit to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oh, brothers, I do not like to speak much about myself, but I can testify that the Christ we experience is an unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the past thirty years the things which have befallen me have always been increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The burden of the Lord s work, the churches, and the co-workers has always been increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problems have never decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burdens, the troubles, the problems, the difficulties have been increasing day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But, praise the Lord, by the increase of the burden, I have experienced Christ more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have realized that Christ is without any kind of limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There can never be a problem which is bigger than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There can never be a situation which He cannot cover.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have a handkerchief which is only so big perhaps twelve inches by twelve inches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It can only cover so much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It can never cover the whole room; it is not big enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But you must realize that Christ is like a piece of cloth without limit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You cannot tell how broad and how long He is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no limit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can cover anything and every thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter how great a problem may be, Christ can cover it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is good in His unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is good in His breadth and length and height and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is such a spacious land for us to experience and enjoy in every situation.</S>
