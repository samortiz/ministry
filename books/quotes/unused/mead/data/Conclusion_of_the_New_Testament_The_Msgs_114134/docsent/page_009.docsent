   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR PAST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the two preceding messages we covered the believers life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now in this message we shall consider the believers past both in eternity and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. IN ETERNITY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As believers, we have a very long history.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, we have an eternal history, for our history began in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In eternity we were foreknown by God, chosen by God, and predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Foreknown by God a. According to the Foreknowledge of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 8:29a refers to the believers as those whom God foreknew.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In eternity God foreknew us according to His foreknowledge 1 Pet 1:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Testament the root of the words foreknowledge and foreknow is know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To this root a prefix is attached.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek prefix pro means before or beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In New Testament Greek, words such as foreknow and foreknowledge imply more than what we would understand from the English translations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek root for these words includes the meaning of appreciation, approval, and possession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we approve something, we shall appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we shall want to take possession of it and own it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The foreknowledge of God spoken of in 1 Peter 1:2 implies that in eternity past God approved us and appreciated us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It also implies that in eternity past He took us over, possessed us, owned us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may even say that as Joseph married Mary, God in His foreknowledge married us in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no time element with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All this is included in the connotation of the word foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s foreknowledge also includes His foreordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In his expanded translation of the New Testament, Kenneth S. Wuest uses the word foreordination in 1:2, saying that the believers are chosen-out ones, this choice having been determined by the foreordination of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all were ordained by God the Father in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to God s Good Pleasure</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which He Purposed in Himself</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In eternity past we were foreknown by God according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself Eph 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s good pleasure is the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Ephesians speaks from the standpoint of God s good pleasure, the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to 1:9, God s good pleasure is what He has purposed in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In human terms, God s good pleasure is what makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is something in God s heart that pleases Him and makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is God s good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s good pleasure has been purposed by God in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that God Himself is the initiation, origin, and sphere of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has a plan, a desire, and according to His plan He has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The existence of the universe is according to God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Heaven, earth, millions of items, and the human race are all according to God s purposed desire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually all these things will issue in God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the universe there is a desire, God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because this desire has been purposed by God, no one and nothing can overthrow it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything that takes place on earth is for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We, the believers in Christ, are the focal point of His purpose, and everything is working for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has purposed this desire in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not take counsel with anyone else regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chosen by God the Father</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In eternity past we were chosen by God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s choosing is His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From among innumerable people God selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word chosen implies that some were selected and that others were not selected.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We praise the Lord that we are among the chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The fact that we were chosen in eternity means that our salvation began in eternity, that it began before creation and before time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we turn to our spirit and contact the Lord regarding this matter, we shall realize that just as God is eternal, so His choosing of us is also related to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to thank God the Father for His eternal selection, the selection made in eternity past for eternity future.</S>
