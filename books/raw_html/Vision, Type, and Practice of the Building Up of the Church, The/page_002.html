<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF A VISION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16</h1>
<p>In this book we will see how to be built up and how to build up the church. How to be built up emphasizes our being built up, and how to build up the church emphasizes our serving for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s service is governed by his spiritual knowledge. In other words, our service is governed by our vision. Our service before the Lord will match our spiritual knowledge. For example, 1 John 1:2 says, &ldquo;The life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life.&rdquo; Eternal life was John&rsquo;s vision. Hence, when he preached the salvation of God, he brought people to know and to receive eternal life. The extent of our service is determined by the extent of our knowledge concerning spiritual matters. Our spiritual knowledge always   governs our service. Hence, we will first speak of the vision concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>The Lord is leading us to see that His intention is not merely to save thousands of individuals. He wants to gain a corporate Body, the church. According to Ephesians, the church that God intends to gain is a Body, a dwelling place, the new man, and a counterpart (3:6; 2:22, 15; 5:31-32). The Body, dwelling place, new man, and counterpart are all corporate. A body is an entity composed of many members coordinated together. A dwelling place is a structure built with different materials. Concerning the church as the new man, God has not only saved the Jews and Gentiles; He has also created the two into one new man. No matter how many Jews and Gentiles are saved, in God&rsquo;s eyes they are one new man. In chapter 5 this new man is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ. Of course, Christ has only one counterpart. Although the Bible uses other titles besides these four in reference to the church, these four titles clearly portray the church as a corporate entity.</p>
<p>Due to the inadequacy of our vocabulary to define the church, we borrowed a common expression and say that the church is a corporate entity. However, we should never think that the church as a corporate entity resembles a human organization. The church is not an organization; it is a group of persons who have received the Holy Spirit, God&rsquo;s life, and all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ and who are being coordinated as the Body of Christ, built up as a dwelling place, and produced as the new man. This new man is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes the church is composed of all the saints. The entire Bible shows that, universally speaking, the church is the totality of all the believers.</p>
<p>In time, however, the church needs to be expressed in the places where people live. Thus, there are churches in different localities. Since the people who constitute the church live in communities when they are saved by God, they cannot detach themselves from their communities after they are saved. Therefore, in His wisdom God has caused His church to be expressed in place after place. In a large city, where many people are saved, the expression of the church is large. In a small village, where fewer people are saved, the expression of the church is smaller. However, regardless of the place and of whether the expression of the church is large or small, there can only be one expression. In a small place the expression cannot be less than one, nor can the expression be more than one in a large place. No matter how large a city may be or how small a village may be, the expression of the church in that place is always one. There is one church in the universe, and there is also one expression of the church in any one place.</p>
<p>When the apostles were alive and the church was not divided or in confusion, there was only one expression of the church in any given place. A person could not find more than one church in Jerusalem. Similarly, there was only one church in Antioch. Locally there is only one church in one place, and universally there is only one church. Unlike today, when there are many congregations with different names, the early church was not a special organization, nor did it have a special name. In the apostles&rsquo; time a person could find only one church wherever he went, and that church was the local expression of the universal church in that place.</p>
<p>Later, the church fell into confusion and was divided. The more the church divides, the more confused the situation becomes. It seems as though God has no intention to solve the problem of division. He does not like division, but He seems to tolerate it and allow it to continue. God will always desire to have a group of people who care for His intention and take the way that He ordains, that is, to be overcomers. This means that although God tolerates confusion, He still desires to have a group of people who care for His heart and who rise up to serve Him and bear His testimony according to His original intention. He wants His believers to be overcomers, to return to the original position and condition of the church. He still desires to gain a group of people, who love Him with a pure heart, to be the church bearing the proper testimony of Christ His Son in every place.</p>
<p>If we see this revelation, our service will not consist merely of having a zeal for the gospel and of helping others to love the Lord fervently and consecrate themselves to live for the Lord. Even helping them to pursue spirituality and to live an overcoming and sanctified life are not adequate. The earth is filled with sects, confusion, and division, but the Lord has commissioned us to rise up to be the overcomers in this age of desolation, that is, to be the testimony of the church in every place.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
