<p class="bold">WEEK 2 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt. 1:21 &nbsp;And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus…</p><p class="bold">23 &nbsp;“Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel” (which is translated, God with us).</p><p class="bold">Rom. 10:13 &nbsp;For “whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</p><p class="bold">2 Tim. 4:22 &nbsp;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The last part of Matthew 1…deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel.…Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man.…Three elements [are] in the name of Jesus. [First,] the name Jesus includes the name Jehovah…[which] means I Am—I Am Who I Am (Exo. 3:14). The verb “to be” in Hebrew not only refers to the present, but also includes both the past and the future. Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am Who I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever.…Because the name of the Lord is the I Am, we may say, “Lord, You told me that Your name is I Am. Then, what are You?” His answer will be, “I am whatever you need.” The [second] element included in the name of Jesus is…the Savior. Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from all negative things. [Third,] Jesus is not only the Savior, He Himself is also our salvation. Do not ask Him to give you salvation. Instead, you should say, “Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation.”</p><p>The name of Jesus is above every name (Phil. 2:9-10).… [The] exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things. Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in (John 1:12).…We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus.…The name of Jesus is for us to be baptized into (Acts 8:16; 19:5).…To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person.…The name of Jesus is also for us to be saved. Acts 4:12 says, “Neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.” [Both Acts 3:6 and 4:10 testify] that the name of Jesus is also a healing name.…The name of Jesus has been given to us so that we may be washed, sanctified, and justified (1 Cor. 6:11).…If the name of Jesus were an empty name, how could it wash…sanctify and justify us? This would be impossible. However, this name is linked to the Spirit. The Spirit is the Person of the name and the reality of the name. Therefore the name can wash us, sanctify us, and justify us. The Spirit is one with the name. Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord.…The name of Jesus is for us to call upon (Rom. 10:13; 1 Cor. 1:2).…If you call on His name, you will taste Him and enjoy Him.…Because Satan and all his demons hate the name of Jesus, we must proclaim it all the more.…Moreover, we must learn to suffer for this name [Acts 5:41; 15:26, and]…never deny the name of Jesus [Rev. 3:8].</p><p>Now we come to the second name, Emmanuel (1:23).… When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us.…Whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us (18:20).…Jesus is with us all the days, even until the consummation of the age (28:20).…Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit [2 Tim. 4:22].</p><p>According to Isaiah 8:7-8, the enemy may try to take over the land of Emmanuel. [But] Isaiah 8:10 tells us that because God is with us, the enemy can never take over the land of Emmanuel. Although Satan has tried his best to take you over…you are still here because of Emmanuel, because of God with us. This Emmanuel is Jesus. Today we may enjoy Jesus and experience Him…as our Emmanuel.
