	 <h2 class="head2">Encouraging Everyone to Function</h2>
<p>Our goal is not merely to draw people to the meetings. That is not the purpose of our work. The full-time co-workers must be trained, and they must pray much when they go to help the saints enter into their function. The co-workers must pray for more than half an hour every day; it is best if they can pray for an hour or more every day. We need to pray desperately for every family that we are responsible for, and we must pray for every saint by name. Then according to the burden that we receive from the Lord, we should go to care for and encourage the saints one by one until they begin to function in their service. Then every saint will be an apostle, and they will be a prophet and a teacher.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says that God has given the church first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers. I would ask: Are you an apostle, a prophet, or a teacher? You might think that you are not qualified and that you are neither an apostle nor a prophet nor a teacher. We need a change in concept. If you preach the gospel to your unsaved parents, you are an apostle. An apostle is a sent one. When the Lord sends you to preach the gospel to your unsaved parents, you are an apostle. After your parents believe, and you go to them with words of building up, encouragement, and comfort, you are a prophet. When you are sent to preach the gospel, you are an apostle; when you prophesy for the Lord to encourage others, you are a prophet. Later, when you teach them something further, you are a teacher. You should not despise yourself; in the church you can be an apostle, a prophet, and a teacher. It would be wonderful for all five thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly in the church in Taipei to be first apostles, then prophets, and then teachers. The church in Taipei would have five thousand saints who are apostles, prophets, and teachers. Then there would be hope for the spread and increase of the church.</p>
<p>This is the teaching in the Bible. But since Christians have completely lost this matter, they think that they are not apostles or prophets or teachers. Consequently, they hire pastors and preachers to be their apostles, prophets, and teachers. This is an error. We must encourage everyone to function. The thought in Christianity is that every responsibility must be given to an expert in that profession. For example, one can be a medical doctor only if he has studied medicine, and only those who study other professions can practice those professions. Christianity thinks that preaching the word is a profession, so if a person has never studied in a seminary and has not been educated in the knowledge of the Bible, he cannot be a preacher. When this is the case, the function of the saints is annulled.</p>
<p>A Christian who graduates from seminary and who is hired by a congregation to be their pastor and preacher does everything. Only he acts as an apostle, prophet, and teacher. This results in all the saints in that congregation being unemployed, and it annuls their organic function. This kills the function of the members of the Body of Christ, and it is most offensive to the Lord. This is not the practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because we want to perfect the saints who are not apostles to be apostles and to perfect the saints who are not prophets to be prophets and to perfect the saints who are not teachers to be teachers. This is what the co-workers must do. They must go out to create apostles, produce prophets, and perfect the saints to be teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging Everyone to Study the Truth</h2>
<p>In order to be apostles, prophets, and teachers, we need to study the truth. If we say that we are apostles, prophets, and teachers but cannot speak the truth, we are just pretending. There are many experienced saints among us, but they cannot accurately explain the names <em>Jesus</em> and <em>Christ.</em> We must study the truth if we are to go out as apostles, prophets, and teachers.</p>
<p>Even though the churches abroad speak highly of the church in Taipei, the church in Taipei is not yet up to the standard. There are many young people among us who cannot clearly speak the truth. In order to be apostles, prophets, and teachers, we must understand the truth. This is the main responsibility of the full-time co-workers. We need many full-time serving ones, because the earth is covered in darkness. People everywhere are blind and groping in the darkness. However, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are full of light and the truth. There is a need for many to go out to different places and preach the truth. The full-time serving ones do not need to go out to preach; instead, they should encourage and perfect every brother and sister to go out to speak. If the co-workers can do this, there will be a rich result.</p>
