<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The work among the sisters in Shanghai is being carried on as before. The brothers are also stirred up to preach the gospel once a week. The bread-breaking meeting has been divided into three locations: (1) Dr. Stearns' house; (2) Brother Luh Chien-ti's house; and (3) Wen-teh Lane. My future is not altogether decided. Peking, Amoy, and Hwang-Yen have all sent letters inviting me to stay with them for a while. The Lord willing, and if circumstances permit and no accident frustrates the way, I hope to go first to the north when the work here is completed by the beginning of July and then to go to the south by October. However, I do not have the approval of my aged mother yet.</p><p>Miao Yun-chun, Shanghai, June 9</p><h2 class="head2">From Yi-Shing to Shanghai</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has delivered me from peril and has led me safely to Shanghai. I am very thankful for your prayer and that of the other brothers and sisters in the Lord. After Yi-Shing fell into the hand of the enemy, our whole family moved into the mountains. During the past half year, we have had no peace day and night. Many times we had to escape from one place to another. During the most dangerous period, we stayed for two nights in a valley, and one night we traveled several dozen Chinese miles. It was impossible to read the Bible. All we could do was pray. Thank the Lord that He brought His word to my memory: He will not forsake those who put their trust in Him, and He can do what is impossible for man to do. My heart was comforted, and I overcame the outward exile and suffering, fully believing that God would bring us out of our peril. Later, when the crisis was over, we returned to our homes only to find that parts of our homes were burned. We left the mountain homeland and migrated to another town called Jou Tieh-Chiao. On April 17 I hired a boat and went to Ch'ang-Yin-Sha with my sister Teh-jia. I boarded an American merchant steamer and arrived in Shanghai safely on the nineteenth. Teh-jia is employed in a hospital. I have not found a job, and I am staying at Shen's house, where Sister Wang Yi-ying was tutoring. I have tasted God's amazing grace this time and can only thank and praise Him. I am very happy because I have the opportunity once again to go to meetings.</p><p>Di Hwei-jia, May 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">From Nan-ch'ang to Shanghai</h2><p>I left Nan-ch'ang on the thirteenth and arrived at Jin-Hwa on the evening of the fourteenth. On the sixteenth I arrived in Wenchow. Although there were many delays and difficulties during this portion of the journey, the Lord's grace has been sufficient for us, and we have been safe. We stayed in Wenchow for a few days because we had to wait for the boat. Through the Lord's care and arrangement, we stayed at a Brother Hwang's house. Brothers Ma Lung-rue, Chang Tsao-tung, Shiao Wen-bing, and my father were with me. Mrs. Hwang was very hospitable and demonstrated the love of Christ. I went to see Brother Pan Huo-ling. He is very weak and needs much prayer. May the Lord heal him. I also met Brother Chang and a few sisters. On the twentieth we boarded the boat in Wenchow, and on the morning of the twenty-second, we arrived safely in Shanghai. God has been gracious to us. Thank and praise Him! The brothers and sisters here are under God's protection, and every Thursday we have the brothers' and sisters' meetings.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Nan-geng, Shanghai, May 29</p>
