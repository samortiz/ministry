   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FARM AND THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point, I would like to say a further word concerning the church as God s farm and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The expression God s farm refers mainly to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building, the temple, refers to the goal of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the church is the farm to produce materials so that God may fulfill His goal to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First we have the farm for the growth in life, then the building for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be able to grasp these crucial matters is an indication that we have taken in the solid food in 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise the Lord that the farm is for the growth in life and that the building is for the fulfillment of God s goal!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 3:17 Paul says that the temple of God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the context, to be holy here is not simply to be separated to God; to be holy means not to be Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we think that the word holy merely means to be separated, our understanding of this verse is too superficial and doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the Corinthians to be separated unto God means that they are no longer Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, for us to be holy, separated unto God, means that we are no longer American, Chinese, Japanese, or German.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we see this matter, it is a sign that we have received solid food from verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It proves that we have grasped something experiential, practical, and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be God s building means that we are no longer divided or scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the context of these chapters, the building is versus division.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul knew that the Greek believers at Corinth had been divided by their preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:12 he says, Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the believers had been scattered; they were not even piled up, much less built up together to be God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To repeat, God desires a building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s goal is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, He wants a farm to grow Christ, and then He wants a building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Corinthians did not have a building which was holy, a building which was outside Greek culture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that they did not have a building which was holy and indwelt by the Spirit of God, a building which contained nothing of their wisdom, philosophy, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, God s goal is to have a building filled with the Spirit of God, a building of materials grown on His farm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As believers, we all must be for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>RECEIVING MERCY TO SEE THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we realize our shortage concerning the growth in life and the building, we may react in a way which causes us to become even more veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may become excited, others may weep, and still others may pray or try to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But it is possible even for excitement, weeping, praying, and repenting to become veils.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These activities may hinder us from seeing the vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To see this vision we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Romans 9 we have a word about God s mercy and, in Acts 9 an illustration of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 9:16 says, So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Acts 9, God showed mercy to Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No doubt, Saul prayed a great deal before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is doubtful, however, that God ever answered his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But one day, to Saul s great surprise, the Lord appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to weep, pray, or repent in a religious way, but we do need the Lord s mercy to see the vision shown to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to see how much we are still living in our culture, tradition, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to see that we are living in many things other than Christ and that we are not actually living Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, we have heard messages, but still we may not see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Oh, we need the Lord s mercy to see a heavenly vision!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither our weeping nor our excitement means anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Again I say, we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we should not pray in an excited way or in a religious way, we should pray earnestly for the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us all pray, Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I need to see the vision seen by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, grant me a clear sky that I may see the revelation of Your economy.</S>
