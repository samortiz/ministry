The Feast</H2><P>Christ as our portion for our enjoyment is also our feast. Colossians 2:16-17 says, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ." The various items of the ceremonial law mentioned here are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come, but the body is of Christ and is Christ. The body, like a man's physical body, is the substance, something solid. The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel. Christ is the reality of the gospel. All the good things in the gospel belong to Christ and are Christ.</P><P>Paul's word here indicates that to the believers Christ is the feast. This is typified by the yearly feasts of the Jews, such as the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. Three times a year the Jews went up to Jerusalem to keep the feasts, to eat, drink, and rejoice together with God before Him. Therefore, the feasts signify joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction. Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ. Christ is our real joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction. Christ is the reality of all the feasts.</P>
