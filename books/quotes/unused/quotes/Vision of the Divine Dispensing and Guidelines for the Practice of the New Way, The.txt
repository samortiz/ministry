Chapters nine and ten are messages given to the full-time workers in the evangelizing work in the villages in Taiwan
It is higher than the plant life, and includes such things as the insects, the livestock, the beasts, the fish, and the birds
We thought that to preach the gospel was to speak of the cleansing of sins, redemption, justification, and reconciliation
If this person passed the examination, then he could be baptized, and only then could he be considered to have completed the process
When we eat and drink of Him, He enters into us and is mingled with us to become our constitution and our element
If there are gospel friends here, all you need to do is to open up yourself, call on the Lord Jesus, and receive Him
The Gospel of John states explicitly at the beginning that 'in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
For the accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the Son went through a further step of crucifixion on the cross
The Triune God passed through all the processes to become ultimately the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into all the believers
By this, the divine attributes of the Triune God God's love, Christ's grace, and the Spirit's fellowship are with us
We also have justification, sanctification, and redemption, together with all the human virtues, such as patience, humility, and obedience
The giving of His Spirit is His divine dispensing, and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
On our part, there is still a step we need to take to receive His dispensing, which is to spend time to come to Him and to contact Him
The ones who have received the resurrection life of Christ as the grains produced through His dispensing become the bread which is His Body
Through His death and resurrection, He released the divine life to produce many grains as His increase for the expression of His glory
Even if we cannot memorize them, it is still good if we can copy them on a piece of paper and carry it around with us
We need to write down their names and give a copy of this list to the church and keep another copy for ourselves
For this reason from now on we should prepare a list of our gospel friends on the one hand and establish group meetings on the other hand
If new ones or gospel friends come into our midst and listen and observe what we are doing, they will be quite interested and impressed
About half an hour before the close of the group meeting, we can take the gospel friends aside and preach the gospel to them individually
We should exercise the authority that the Lord has given us and should lead them to believe in Christ to call on His name and to be baptized
After the new ones are baptized and have changed their clothes, we should conduct a lesson with them on the way of life
The main thing is to tell them that our Savior is living in us today; we can call on His name all the time to contact Him and to enjoy Him
We should ask them to get up fifteen minutes earlier than usual and make an appointment to have morning revival with them over the telephone
At this end time, this crucial time, may You open our eyes and gain our hearts so that we would be open to You and to Your desire
May You enlighten us, speak to us, that we would be fully enlightened and would have the morning star rise in our hearts
May You open Yourself to us and dispense Yourself to us, so that every one of us may gain You from Your word once again
These scholars not only were familiar with biblical history, but they also were very well acquainted with the types in the Bible
In order to understand the prophecy concerning the coming of Christ, we must go back to the book of Daniel in the Old Testament
Generally speaking, this period began from the first coming of Christ and will continue to the second coming of Christ
When the seventh trumpet blows, that is, at the end of this age, all these mysteries will be fulfilled, completed, and will come to pass
From this we see that the last week is the key to all the prophecies, and Antichrist will be the chief character in that week
Antichrist will be the Caesar of the revived Roman Empire and will be ranked with the previous Roman Caesars as the seventh Caesar
By this we can see that the ancient Roman Empire must be restored, and the temple in Jerusalem must be rebuilt
Based on reliable sources, we know that the Israelites are actively making preparations for the rebuilding of the temple
The good land that God promised to Israel in the beginning extends from the river Euphrates on the east to the great sea on the west
On the other hand, He will appear to the Israelites like lightning, and the whole house of Israel will be saved
Christ will sit on His throne of glory and will judge the nations that are still alive, separating the people as 'sheep' and 'goats'
The prophets in the Old Testament, in foretelling the coming of Christ, thought that He would have only one coming
It is also like a girl waiting to be married, who knows of the wedding day and who is waiting wholeheartedly for that day to arrive
When we see the temple rebuilt and Antichrist appearing, we will know more assuredly that the nation of Israel will quickly be restored
When the Lord comes, He will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him, and will take them away as a treasure
By this we will be preserved and kept from the great tribulation, which will come upon the whole inhabited earth
Corinthians 3:10-17 tells us that we should be careful how we build the church upon the foundation laid by the apostles
The more we are touched by You, the more we will bow before You and will vow to You to offer ourselves completely to You
During these two meetings, speak to us point by point the words in Your heart, that is, the words that You want us to practice and to follow
According to my observation, whether in America or in Taiwan, this practice has obviously succeeded, though not in full, at least in part
Today on the whole earth, although the Lord's recovery has encountered many weaknesses and shortcomings, it has reached all six continents
After the three years of 1985, 1986, and 1987, the big meeting on Sunday morning was still practiced in Taipei
It was in October 1987, after we had the gospel festival in Taipei, that we said goodbye to the meeting in which one man speaks
When the grains are ripe, one must hurry and harvest them in the field, even if he has important engagements at home
It also says that the sluggard will not plow because of the cold; therefore, he will beg during the harvest and have nothing
In the arena, whether one engages in running, wrestling, high jumping, or any other sport, everything can be summed up in these words
At that time Paul was facing opposition from three directions: from Judaism, from the Gnostics, and from the heathen traditions
We have to know that in God's creation there is a natural law: those who are not diligent cannot expect to have success
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The poison of Christianity is in their attempt to make those to whom they preach clearly understand salvation before baptizing them
The word of the Lord says that we should go and should disciple all nations, baptizing them into the Triune God
We should believe that when we go out to visit people and to preach the gospel, the Spirit operates in every word of ours
Although they do not oppose the new way, their heart is not there; they are still working according to the old way
The principle that governs the way we do things in the world is the same as that which governs the way we do the work of God
Every brother or sister has at least twenty gospel friends, either their unsaved relatives, their friends, or their neighbors
They should pray not only for one or two months but for a long time perhaps for at least a year and see how the Lord will hear their prayers
It does not matter whether or not one takes the new way; as long as he is pursuing the Lord, he must bear fruit
If we still would not stretch forth our hands to save others, we will really have no words with which to defend ourselves
Have all those who are willing to set aside three hours a week for the definite preaching of the gospel sign their names
You should check occasionally with those who have submitted their names to be the praying ones for the practice of the new way
During the group meetings or after the Lord's table meeting, you may ask them to give some testimonies in order to remind them
Those for whom the greater effort is required are the ones who have submitted their names for going out to preach the gospel every week
You should not speak things which leave others bewildered, but should apply the exact medicine needed for the sickness
In this way, you will have more contact and conversation with him and will be able to give him appropriate suggestions and definite leadings
Spontaneously, there will be the mutual care, the mutual intercession, the mutual shepherding, and the mutual help
It is better that the number of people attending the group meetings exceed the number attending the Lord's Day meeting
Besides the mutual care, feeding, mutual acquaintance, and intercession, another main function of the group meeting is the perfecting
According to the revelation in the New Testament, the practice of the new way sometimes requires the help of the apostles and teachers
There is another important lesson which we must not forget: regardless of which church, hall, or district we are in, we are all one Body
At the same time we also have the intention that some would go overseas to spread the Lords recovery especially in Latin America and Africa
Most of the other parts of the world use English as the principle language and are primarily under the influence of the Protestant churches
Both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are far away from the Bible in their form, expression, and content
In the third period, from about 1590 to today, they passed through the Latin language and entered into the English language
Today the riches of all the theological studies throughout the centuries can now be found among the English-speaking world
Beginning from 1920 with Brother Watchman Nee, we have had brothers among us who have read, investigated, and dived into these riches
Now it is laid before us with the hope that it will carry on what was in the past and will lead us to further developments in the future
At the end of the Bible there is a warning, saying that no one can add anything to or delete anything from this book
In reading the Lord's word, the mental capacity and the spiritual understanding need to be continually exercised
There was the need for Philip to explain to him so that he could preach to him Jesus as the gospel and lead him to believe and be baptized
In the same way, there are many passages in the Bible which require explanation before one can understand them
Although everyone is busy during the day with very little extra time, everyone can get up fifteen minutes earlier
During the day you can 'chew' on these words again and again, digesting and receiving the Lord's supply from them
The simplest way for us to teach people to read the Bible is to give them a kind of leading, guidance, or adjustment in a spontaneous way
Spontaneously, as you are pray-reading or praying with others, some words will come out which contain the enlightening or teaching element
You will feel that the training is strenuous because your mental capability has not received enough development
After you graduate from college, and before you step into society, you should set aside two years to be trained here
Unconsciously, your entire being will be affected; your thought, concept, and knowledge of people and of God will be different
He is like God in that he has a mind, a will, and an emotion, with feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure
What is crucified and terminated is the old 'I,' and what is regenerated with God within as life is the new 'I'
It says that we the Gentiles, who were the wild olive branches, have been grafted into a cultivated olive tree
As soon as we make up our mind to do good, we bring in the conflict between the good in the mind and the evil in the flesh
Rather, we should simply live in our regenerated spirit, reject our natural being, ignore our flesh, and give up the thoughts of doing good
It is not Christ Himself alone who lives, but we live Him out through our cooperation with Him and through His union and mingling with us
According to the requirement of the New Testament, Christ not only wants to live in us, He also wants to make home in our hearts
Once we become full-grown in Christ, victory, sanctification, spirituality, riches, and even authority will all become ours
At the same time, you have to speed-read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament every day
After two or three years, according to your inner feeling and as the Lord leads in the outward circumstances, you may serve full-time again
Those trainees who are presently in the training are also invited to attend, because in the future, they will also be taking the same way
According to the Bible, everyone who belongs to the Lord is a member in the Body of the Lord and should therefore be a co-worker
According to my understanding, your evangelization work in the villages during the past year or so has not been without spiritual warfare
In the experience of life you have definitely learned more spiritual lessons than you would have learned by being in a big church
You should not consider quitting the training as a solution, because this would betray your initial consecration of living to the Lord
Our burden here is to spread the gospel to at least every village and town and to raise up the Lord's churches in those places
Although your work today does not seem to be very great outwardly and at times appears rather difficult, in reality it is very worthwhile
They will have a stable character, being honest and faithful to others, so that they would not forsake the Lord or the church
As long as there are such brothers, you can slowly let your hands go and let them take up the responsibilities
For this reason, from now on, on the one hand, you have to gain new ones, but on the other hand, you have to perfect men
Even if you cannot study them by yourself, you have to thoroughly read through the Life-study messages on these five books
If you dive into the Lords word daily and become fully rooted and grounded what you speak will be different and the result will be different
Whether or not you will go abroad in the future, you must know at least two languages your native language and a foreign language
Even if you have indeed learned something, do not have any intention of showing yourselves off or of feeling proud about yourselves
May we be those who can truly help others, and may others receive help from us, but we must never hope that others will follow us
We have a general plan that by the summer of 1993, all the ones sent out to the villages for the evangelization work will be called back
By then, if some of you decide not to be full-timers anymore, you can get jobs and live in the church life in your localities
The result is that we only care for our own work and do not care whether others have the opportunity to work or not
If those that you have brought to the Lord would go to another nearby church for the sake of convenience, you should rejoice over it
Although we were not together all the time, we had much contact with each other for the sake of the Lord's work
We never dined with each other or had tea with each other for any reason that was exclusively personal in nature
You cannot condemn many things as sin, and certain things may not be wrong in themselves, yet they will cause us to come short
The wood, grass, and stubble here signify the things that originate from the natural background and natural lifestyle of the believers
Some among the brothers may have rendered you a lot of help, while others may not have rendered as much help to you
Paul told us in Galatians 5 that we should not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another
In Philippians 2 he desired that the brothers think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, and think the one thing
You have to remember that we are here in the training for the purpose of being trained and sent out to work together
The principle must be kept that two of the opposite sex must never talk with each other alone in a closed room
You must not bring in natural affection or any worldliness, and you should not let others feel that you are proud
All the practices that we have are for the Lord's recovery and for the work of the building up of the Body of Christ
