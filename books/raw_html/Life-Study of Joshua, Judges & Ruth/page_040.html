and the Children of Naphtali and Zebulun,<br />
Defeating Jabin King of Canaan</h2>

<p>Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;O Jehovah, when You went forth from Seir, / When You marched from the field of Edom; / The earth trembled, the heavens also dripped, / Indeed the clouds dripped water. / The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, / Sinai there, at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.&rdquo; Here Deborah and Barak celebrated triumphantly their victory over Jabin king of Canaan, given to them by God.</p>

Who Took the Lead<br />
