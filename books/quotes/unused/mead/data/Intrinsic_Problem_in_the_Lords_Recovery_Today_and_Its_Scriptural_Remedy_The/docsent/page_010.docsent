   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Identity of the Churches The Seven Golden Lampstands, Symbols</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Seven Churches, Being All Identical</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 1:11-12 and 20, the seven golden lampstands, symbols of the seven local churches in Asia, are all identical in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all these aspects the seven lampstands are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This signifies that all the local churches should be the same in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Seven Churches Differing</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>in the Business Affairs of Their Administration</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the normal differences among the churches can be only in the business affairs of their administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Lord did not touch business affairs in the seven epistles to the seven churches, as a rule, according to their practical needs, the churches should be different in the business affairs of their administration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These affairs include such matters as the times of the church meetings, and whether the church purchases property and builds a meeting hall or simply rents a room or a building for its meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In matters such as these, there is no need for the churches to be identical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To require all the churches to be identical in these matters would be very awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Seven Churches Being the Same</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Normally in the Positive Things</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seven churches were the same normally in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In all the positive things concerning the Lord Jesus, the churches should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Lord s speaking to the seven churches, the positive things were commended, strengthened, encouraged, and exalted by the Lord for the abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These positive things include: in Ephesus, labor, endurance, and the hating of the works of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:2-3, 6 ; in Smyrna, the suffering of tribulation, poverty, and trial, and being faithful 2:9-10 ; in Pergamos, holding fast the Lord s name and not denying the faith of the Lord 2:13 ; in Thyatira, love, faith, service, and endurance 2:19 ; in Sardis, not defiling their garments 3:4 ; and in Philadelphia, keeping the word of the Lord and not denying His name 3:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Seven Churches Differing Abnormally</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only in the Negative Things</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seven churches differed abnormally only in the negative things, which were rebuked, judged, condemned, and corrected by the Lord for elimination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These negative things include: in Ephesus, some calling themselves apostles and not being such, and the church leaving its first love Rev 2: 1a, 2, 4 ; in Pergamos, the church settling in the world, some holding the teaching of Balaam, and some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans 2:12a, 13-15 ; in Thyatira, the church tolerating the woman Jezebel to teach and lead the Lord s slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices 2:18a, 20 ; in Sardis, the church having a name that it was living but it was dead, and its works not being found by Christ completed before God 3:1-2 ; and in Laodicea, the church being neither cold nor hot, but boasting, I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing 3:14-15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s rebuking indicates that the Lord does not want such differences.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By reading the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation, we can see that all the local churches should be the same in positive things, but not in negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The churches should be different only in business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, whether a church buys a piece of land and builds a meeting hall should depend on the church s need and on the Lord s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The churches should not be required to follow one another in affairs such as these, but all the churches should be one in all the spiritual aspects concerning the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the first item as the base for us to practice the proper one accord.</S>
