<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF REBELLION<br />IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 21, 1948<br />Place:Kuling Mountain<br />Scripture Reading:Lev. 10:1-2</h1><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, You are God from eternity to eternity, and it is foolish for man to boast and exalt himself before You. Vain men will bow down at Your feet one day. We acknowledge our human finitude and worthlessness, but if You will stretch forth Your hand, all of our problems will be solved, and You will have a way through us. We cannot do anything. We are unclean, and we dwell among those who are unclean. We are too weak to climb up by ourselves. Unless You move Your hand, everything we do is in vain, and our building is in vain. May You lead us to a fuller knowledge of Yourself. Grant us the light and the revelation to see You. Amen.</p><p>The evening before last we saw that sin is lawlessness. In Greek the word is anomia, which means to be without law. To sin is to be without law. Today I hope you will see the significance of this definition. The word lawlessness is used in the Bible seventeen or eighteen times. It is, for example, used in 1 John 3:4. In studying the Bible it is sometimes convenient to coin a single definition for a word. For example, we can give definitions to each of the words light, life, death, etc. First John 3:4 gives "lawlessness" as the definition of sin. To sin is to trespass against the law. When we tell this to others, they may not agree. They may not agree that sin is lawlessness or a trespass against the law, but Romans 2:12 says, "For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law." Those who sin without the law (anomos) shall also perish without the law (anomos). The word lawlessness in 1 John 3:4 comes from the same word as the expression without the law in Romans 2:12 in the original language. Both are anomia. The prefix a- means to be without, and nomos means the law. Together the word means to be lawless. Most people think that a person sins when he breaks the law and that he has not sinned if he has not broken the law. But this is not according to the Bible. The Bible says that to sin is to be without the law. Romans 2 says that those who sin without the law shall perish without the law. Therefore, the meaning of sin is lawlessness.</p><p>A man sins when he walks according to his self-will and rebels against God's authority. Many brothers and sisters have heard this word from us for many years. We must, however, repeat it again and again. Those who do good according to their own flesh do not please God. Even if a man's conduct is approved, his very person is condemned as long as he acts according to the flesh. Many people do not see the reason for this. Man is condemned for doing good because this good is not performed under God's authority. Sin means to act presumptuously. If a man does not come under authority, he sins even when his conduct is good. In God's eyes all goodness performed by self-will is lawlessness. God is not concerned with the number of sheep and cattle and the amount of fat that man offers to Him. He demands obedience and submission. Obedience and submission are man's responses to authority. Sacrifice, however, can be a response to the Lord, or it can be a response to self-will. Submission is denying the self and setting it aside.</p><p>Submission is absolute, but sacrifice is not. A man may want to offer a sacrifice, but this desire may be a resolution of the self for the satisfaction of the self. We have to see what sin is. Sin is man acting according to his own nature and deliberation. Sin has nothing to do with whether or not this nature and deliberation are evil. In God's eyes a man sins when he acts according to his own nature and deliberation. This principle has underlined all human action throughout the six thousand years of human history. Many people say that they are acting out of good intention, but they do not realize how much lawlessness is behind these acts.</p>
