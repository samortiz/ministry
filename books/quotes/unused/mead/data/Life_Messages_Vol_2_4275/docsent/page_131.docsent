   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE GOD'S TWOFOLD LAMPS Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1b; Prov 20:27; John 3:6; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4, 6; Rev 1:10a GOD AND MAN BECOMING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible reveals that the relationship God desires to have with man is that He and man become one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not simply that the two are united together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, it is a oneness in which He becomes us and we become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is our life, and we are His living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This relationship is an organic one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I make a table and glue or screw the legs to the top, the relationship between the legs and the top is not organic; there is no living connection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nor are false teeth organically part of us, even though they may look just like our natural teeth; the false teeth are lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GRAFTED TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Grafting illustrates the organic relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is not only the Creator to be worshipped or the Savior to be believed in and followed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He comes into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even many preachers do not have a clear understanding of this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not realize that "he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God and man are not pasted together like two pieces of paper; nor are they welded together like two pieces of metal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God and man are both spirit, when the two spirits touch, they join and grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a branch from one tree is grafted to another, the life from the second tree flows into the branch, and the two become one, sharing the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Similarly, with a skin graft a piece of skin from one part of the body is affixed to another part.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This joining produces an organic activity which results in the two growing together and becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If two similar living things have a wound cut in them, when they are brought together at the site of the wounds, there is a flow of life between them and they can become organically one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This wonderful life process illustrates the relationship between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you been grafted into God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I know you worship Him as the only true God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I know that you have believed in the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But my question is, have you been grafted into Him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your being joined to Him is not like holding hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You would never grow together with Him by holding His hand!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nor is your relationship to Him like that of two sticks tied together!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Grafting requires the life juice from the cut tree to flow into the cut branch; or, in the case of a skin graft, the cells from both parts begin to "fellowship" together and then grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word grow, which describes an organic process, is used in the New Testament in reference to our relationship with the Lord see Rom 6:5; 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God is added to us, He grows with us, like living tissue which is added to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is not like false teeth set next to our regular teeth!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He created a spirit in man Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is most precious that we have a spirit, because this is the means by which we are joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The two spirits can become one and grow together.</S>
