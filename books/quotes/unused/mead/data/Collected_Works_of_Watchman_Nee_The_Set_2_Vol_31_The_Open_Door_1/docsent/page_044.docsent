   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my beloved sister in the Lord, Mrs. X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I read your letter of the ninth, and it reminded me of the verse: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I saw you in Hankow, your speech, attitude, and dress all told me how I should learn to be a faithful witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, I love and respect you for your change; on the other hand, I marvel at the Lord's power and commit my family more zealously before Him and ask Him to change them also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The beloved in the Lord are more dear than sisters in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I always feel that seeing a brother or sister in the Lord, or even hearing their voices, can give me great blessing and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if there is a yoke we must bear together, it is always light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the need calls for our laboring together, we will always find the Lord's leading in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should pray for and remember one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If our loneliness satisfies the Lord and our loss contributes to the Lord's gain, we are willing to be lonely so that the Lord may fully capture our heart!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But no matter how willing we may be, we cannot satisfy or enable Him to gain anything if He does not give us grace to preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Canton all the meetings except the Lord's table stopped on September 21 because there were frequent air raid drills and the roads were often blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many brothers and sisters moved to Hong Kong or the countryside after August 18.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are only a little over ten brothers and sisters left in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are air raids every day, but thank the Lord for His special grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All is peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May you have peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please greet Brother Yu-zhi for me.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has been twenty months since we said good-by to each other in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank the Lord that He wants us to learn to walk on the narrow way during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There have been miracles, and sinners have been saved because the Lord is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is all out of the Lord's mercy, and we thank the brothers and sisters for praying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church in Yi- Lin has been affected by the war in that more and more people are losing their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are poor, cold, and pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can only do my best and pray for them before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The village assemblies in the region of northern Kiangsu are doing better than the cities and towns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not have the fear of airplanes, and they also have their harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are not in any real hardship.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Yung-t'ung opened a tofu shop this fall, and his business is doing well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His second son, Wen-fu, is learning to operate a sewing machine here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His third son, Wen-tseng, is helping out in the tofu shop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The rest of his children are still in school.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone in the family is well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a summary of their individual conditions.</S>
