<p>There are three key points in the account of Mary seeing the Lord Jesus. First, Mary the Magdalene was attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. Second, because Mary loved the Lord, she gained a new discovery, new knowledge, and new revelation concerning the Lord, and she also experienced the Lord&rsquo;s new appearing. Third, Mary, a lover of the Lord, took action based on the revelation that she had received. Mary&rsquo;s action was based on her discovery and revelation. Mary was the first one to discover the empty tomb. After she made this discovery, she took action by running to tell the brothers (v. 2). She was also the first one to see the resurrected Lord. After seeing the resurrected Lord, she went to tell the brothers what the Lord had said to her, according to His charge (vv. 17-18). Mary&rsquo;s action was based on her knowledge of the Lord and was according to the revelation she had received from the Lord.</p>
<p>When we speak of preaching the gospel or of living the church life, we are not promoting outward practices, because outward practices do not yield much success and are not of much value. Our actions must be because the Lord has attracted us again with His love and because we are willing to respond yet again to the Lord in love. When we respond to the Lord in love, we will gain new knowledge and make new discoveries concerning the Lord, and we will receive a burden and a commission from the Lord. We will know what the Lord desires to do and what He wants us to do. Therefore, we must spend time with the Lord every day. To rise up early and draw near to the Lord is not a regulation; rather, we love to rise up early to seek the Lord and come forward into His presence because we are attracted by His love. This is our response to His love. Even if we would make a resolution to be revived every morning, we should rise up with the feeling and sentiment of loving the Lord, just as Mary did. Mary&rsquo;s going to the Lord&rsquo;s tomb early in the morning was the best morning revival. This is a pattern for all the saints to follow in their morning revival.</p>
<p>Keeping morning revival should not be turned into a regulation. No one should be forced to keep it, nor should anyone feel obligated to keep it because everyone else is keeping it. The practice of morning revival is before the Lord. We love the Lord, and our goal is to approach Him, just as Mary went to find the Lord early in the morning. Our time for morning revival is for us to rise up early and appear before the Lord with the desire to see Him face to face. If we will rise up early to meet the Lord in the morning, we will receive fresh revelation concerning the Lord and receive a new mission and a new commission. We will be revolutionized within. There is something wrong with our morning revival if there is no change in our living after two months of reading the Bible and praying during our morning revival. It is impossible for a person to have no change in his living after keeping a time for morning revival for two months. A person must change when he meets the Lord, because the Lord will work in his being and teach him many lessons. When a person draws near to the Lord and sees the Lord, he will definitely be revolutionized. Such a person will mourn, grieve, repent, confess his sins, and feel convicted regarding his past. His temper and disposition will be dealt with, and he will experience a new revival. Then the Lord will give him a new burden and fresh feelings, enabling him to care about the affairs of the saints and of the church. This is the result of rising up early to draw near to the Lord.</p>
<p>When we rise up early to draw near to the Lord, we need to allow Him to touch us, our habits, and our preferences. When we draw near to Him, He will touch our love and our heart. He wants us to love what He loves and to hate what He hates. If we love something that He does not love, He will contend with us so that we have no peace, because He is a jealous God. If we would have such fellowship with the Lord, we will experience His work and receive the dealings from Him. If we do not practice morning revival or if we do it casually, the Lord will not be able to touch us. Then even if we do not commit gross sins, we will often be negligent of our minor mistakes. The meetings will become a pastime in which we watch others sing and pray, and we will listen to messages as if we were watching a show. The Lord will not have any effect in us, and we will be of no use in His hand.</p>
<p>If we keep a time for morning revival with a heart that genuinely loves the Lord, many things will follow. If we draw near to the Lord every morning, He will not let us go. He will not allow us to be an inappropriate or improper Christian. The Lord will thoroughly inquire about everything in our being; He will not cease until we are fully subdued. If we genuinely practice morning revival, we will have new knowledge, new discoveries, new visions, and new revelations concerning the Lord; we will also receive new dealings from the Lord. This is the meaning of meeting the Lord and touching Him. After He deals with us, He will give us a commission and a burden, and this burden will become our mission. A burden is a heavy weight within that presses us down and does not let us go so that we have no peace until we carry out God&rsquo;s charge. Those who meet the Lord receive burdens.</p>
<p>Pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, and preaching the gospel must not become regulations to keep. Please do not consider this fellowship as a doctrine. Rather, we should respond in love to the Lord because we have been attracted by His love. May we all have the prayer of <em>Hymns,</em> #368: &ldquo;More love to Thee, O Lord, / More love to Thee! / Hear Thou the prayer I make / On bended knee; / This is my earnest plea: / More love, O Lord, to Thee, / More love to Thee, / More love to Thee!&rdquo; May the Lord grant such hunger and desperation to motivate us to draw near to Him. If we do not draw near to Him, we will be hungry and thirsty within, and we will not be able to go on or be satisfied. If we rise up early to draw near to the Lord daily, the Lord will meet us. We will have new discoveries of the Lord and receive many dealings in His hand. If we pass through these dealings in His presence, we will receive a burden for His work. Then others will not need to beg us to preach the gospel, because we will be burdened for the gospel and also compelled to preach the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
