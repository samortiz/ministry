<p>The third stage of the progressive revelation of God in the Bible is the redeeming God. God was first revealed in the Bible as a &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God. Next God was revealed as the incarnated God. Then the incarnated God went to the cross. We should not think that He went to the cross because He was arrested and forced to go there. He went to the cross voluntarily. If He had not chosen to go to the cross, no one could have forced Him. When I was young, I felt pity for Jesus when I read the story of His arrest, thinking that He should have run away from those evil people. However, it was not those people who caused Him to go to the cross; rather, it was He Himself who chose to go to the cross. We may feel pity for Him, but He was happy to walk to the cross. Luke 23:27-28 says, &ldquo;A great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him followed Him. But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves.&rdquo; It was glorious that the incarnated God willingly went to Calvary to be crucified. He was ready to be put on the cross by the Roman soldiers. By passing through crucifixion, He became the redeeming God.</p>
<p>In the history of mankind Jesus was the only person who walked into death and walked back out. He walked into death to take a tour of death in order to study death firsthand. After He finished His tour through death, He simply walked out of death. Death had no hold on Him. He conquered death, subdued death, and walked out of death. This was the resurrection of Christ, the incarnated God and the redeeming God. We were redeemed by His walking into death and coming out of death (Eph. 1:7; Rom. 4:25), and now death has no power over us (1 Cor. 15:54-55), for we are in Christ, the redeeming One.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INDWELLING GOD</h2>
<p>We have seen the progressive revelation of the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God, the incarnated God, and the redeeming God. The redeeming God is the crucified and resurrected Christ. Orthodox Jews believe only in the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God, the God of creation. They believe in the God in Genesis 1, but they do not believe in the incarnated God in the four Gospels, nor do they believe in the redeeming God revealed at the end of the Gospels. Fundamental Christians, on the other hand, do believe in the God revealed in these three stages, that is, up to redemption. However, the progressive revelation of God does not stop with the redeeming God. After the Gospels are the Acts and the Epistles, which reveal that the redeeming God has become the indwelling God.</p>
<p>The night after Christ resurrected from among the dead, He came to His disciples in a wonderful way. Because the disciples were in fear of the Jews, they dared not leave their doors open (John 20:19). While they were in this threatening situation, Jesus suddenly appeared in their midst. The Bible does not tell us how He came in. He was not merely a spirit, for He had a physical body and allowed the disciples to touch the marks of the nails in His hands and the hole in His side (v. 25). We cannot explain how something physical could enter into a house without any open doors, but the Lord Jesus did this. When He came and stood in their midst, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). At that point He was no longer only the redeeming God; He became the indwelling God. In His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spirit as the indwelling God is the fourth stage of the revelation of God in the Bible. The first stage of the revelation of God in the Bible is the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God, the second stage is the incarnated God, the third stage is the redeeming God, and the fourth stage is the indwelling God. We may say that we believe in God, but we need to consider what stage of the revelation of God we believe in. Our God was and still is the God of creation, the incarnated God, and the redeeming God. Furthermore, today He is the indwelling God to us. The God of creation is God mainly as the Father. The incarnated and redeeming God is God the Son. As the indwelling God He is the Spirit. The Triune God&mdash;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit&mdash;is not three separate Gods, as some Christians believe. He is only one God, but He is revealed in different stages. In the first stage He is revealed as God the Father. In the second stage He is revealed as the Son, yet His name still is called the Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6). He is both the Son and the Father, and today He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling us. How wonderful that our God is the indwelling God!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
