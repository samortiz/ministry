   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE MULTIFACETED CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John and the book of Colossians are two books in the Bible that speak of Christ as life in a clear and definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two books use plain words, not types or parables, to speak concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Gospel of John the Lord said, I am...the life 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord did not say, I am your life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, in this verse He spoke of life from an objective aspect, not according to the subjective experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in Colossians Paul says, Christ our life 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not only a fact; it is also related to the subjective experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we consider our history, we see that, according to scriptural principles, the Lord has led us along a comprehensive path.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only are there facts, but there are also subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message I am not emphasizing facts; I am emphasizing experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For many years the Lord has given us a comprehensive leading.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have studied many Christian groups to see their strengths and their weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we compared our observations to our experience, we learned that the Lord s way, which is the same as the way shown in the Bible, is multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The revelation contained in the sixty-six books of the Bible is multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, the four living creatures mentioned in Ezekiel are also in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each of the four living creatures has four faces: at the front is the face of a man; on the right, the face of a lion; on the left, the face of an ox; and at the back, the face of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What are the four creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are they men, lions, oxen, or eagles?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based on the revelation in the Bible, we can say that the four living creatures are multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE PROBLEMS IN THE CHURCH BEING DUE TO</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A LACK OF MULTIFACETEDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christians throughout the centuries, especially Christian leaders, have been prone to make the mistake of not being multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christians can be compared to the four living creatures; they have the aspect of being a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some Christians, however, emphasize only the aspect of being a man, and they kick aside the lion, slaughter the ox, and chase away the eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that such a Christian suggests is disapproved by the believers who are lions, opposed by those who are oxen, and denied by those who are eagles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the end, only the believers who emphasize being a man accept this narrow emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Similarly, some Christians are lions, and they devour, chew up, and even step on everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result of this is only failure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to see the problems in church history so that we may appreciate our need to be multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Seven or eight years ago I finished writing the biography of Brother Nee in English, but because of the Spirit s forbidding, I delayed its publication.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1981 I held trainings in Hong Kong and in Taipei on church history.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As I stood at the podium, I realized that there were many things that I could not speak about, because I would expose the errors and weaknesses of many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I had no feeling in my spirit to mention many names or events, even though these were things that I had personally experienced, seen, and even suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were not things that I had merely heard about.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The purpose of these events in our history was for no other reason than to allow us to see light and to learn many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of the problems that we have experienced in our history were because some of the brothers did not have the view of being multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Nee was saved in 1920, and in 1922 he began to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He continued in the church life until he was imprisoned in 1952.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He practiced the church life for about thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most of the experiences that I passed through were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I saw saints enter the Lord s recovery, and within a very short time they had problems.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some saints did not have problems, but they left and started their own groups.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1949 I came to Taiwan, and in 1952 I began to hold formal trainings until 1982.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That was another thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During those thirty years I did not merely observe problems and storms.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I experienced them and even became the target of the storms, because all the arrows were directed at me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During our first thirty years, Brother Nee was the target of the storms, and I was shielded under him as a great umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after thirty years the umbrella was gone, and I became the target.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the storms were centered on me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have experienced many situations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These storms occurred because there was a lack of being multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the ones who created problems, who came into our midst and then went out from us, loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, some were men, some were lions, some were oxen, and some were eagles.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They could not come together with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Humanly speaking, how can a man and a lion stay together?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can lions and eagles get along?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in Christ all things are possible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The center of the four living creatures is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Christ, men, lions, oxen, and eagles can all come together and be one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is the center, and He is multifaceted.</S>
