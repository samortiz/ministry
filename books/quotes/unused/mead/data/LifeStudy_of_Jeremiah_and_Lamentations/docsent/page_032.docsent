   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for Days without Number</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:32 Jehovah says, "Can the virgin forget her ornaments, /Or the bride her attire?/But My people have forgotten Me / For days without number."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Israel had forgotten Jehovah for days without number, for so many days that they could not be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that they had forgotten Him for a very long time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this matter, they were different from the virgin, who could not forget her ornaments, or the bride, who could not forget her attire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word concerning ornaments and attire indicates that God is our ornament and attire; that is, God is our beautification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although God was Israel's beautification, Israel forgot Him.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jehovah's Correcting Punishment</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>K. In Spite of Her Fornication,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jehovah Being Willing to Return to Her Again</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"It is said, / If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man's wife, / Will he return to her again?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>/ Will not that land be / Utterly polluted?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/ But you have committed fornication with many lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>/ Yet return to Me, declares Jehovah" 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that in spite of Israel's fornication, which was like that of a divorced wife, Jehovah would return to her again, if she would return to Him.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows the situation and condition of Israel.</S>
