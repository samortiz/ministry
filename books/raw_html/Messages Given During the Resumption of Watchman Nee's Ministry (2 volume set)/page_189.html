<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SERVICE OF THE WHOLE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (18)</H1><P>Date:April 24, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL REDEEMED ONES NEEDING TO SERVE GOD</H2><P>At present, among God's children there seems to be a common phenomenon that only a certain group of people are serving. However, God's word says that everyone who belongs to God is a servant of God. When the Israelites were in Egypt serving as slaves, they did not have any freedom. God delivered them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea for the purpose that they would serve Him in the wilderness (Exo. 3:18). The number of people under the blood was the number of people who left Egypt. The number of saved ones was the number of serving ones. When the Israelites left Egypt, they brought all the gold and silver with them (Exo. 12:35-36). Hence, as many as there were who were redeemed, that many served God in material offerings, and that many followed the tabernacle. It was not just a minority who served. Both in the Old Testament and in the New as well, there was not a distinction between the serving ones and the non-serving ones. Only degraded Christianity makes a distinction between the serving ones and the non-serving ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HISTORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHANGES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Salvation Being to Obtain<br>a Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>God said explicitly that He would make the Israelites a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). The priests are those who wait on God and follow God. No one else is able to come as close to God as the priests can. Their job is to serve God. The Israelites were to be a kingdom of priests; the whole nation was to be priests.</P><P>The priests' eating, their living, and their slaughtering of the bulls and the goats were all for the purpose of serving God. The proper profession of the priests was to serve God; everything else was a sideline. They were not working as teachers, doctors, or in any other professions. Exodus 19 tells us that God intended that all the Israelites, old or young, great or small, male or female, were to be the priests.</P><P>The goal of God's salvation is to gain the priests (Rev. 1:5-6a). The blood of the Passover lamb delivered the Israelites with the goal of obtaining and ushering in a kingdom of priests. The greatest calling and also the greatest grace is that men can serve God as priests. As many as there were who left Egypt, the same number were to serve God. As many as there were who reached Sinai, that many should serve the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Degradation of the Israelites Resulting In<br>a Kingdom of Priests Becoming a Tribe of Priests</H2><P>At the bottom of the mountain, the Israelites worshipped the golden calf and sinned against God. As a result, Moses told the people to kill their own brothers. However, only the Levites obeyed Moses' words, and they killed three thousand people (Exo. 32:1-29). The loss of three thousand men was not the greatest loss. The greatest loss was that the people could not all be priests any longer. Originally, it was twelve tribes who were to be the priests. Now only one tribe was left (Num. 8:5-19). Originally, it was to be a kingdom of priests. Now it became a tribe of priests. The Levites did not care for human feelings or sentiments, and they stood on God's side. As a result, they gained the priesthood. Here we see that some had forsaken their priesthood. They had forsaken it through the worship of the idol; they established another worship.</P><P>Because of rebellion, the earth opened up its mouth and swallowed up the rebellious ones (Num. 16:30-33). Only Aaron's rod budded; all the other rods became dead (Num. 17:6-10). Only one tribe was selected to serve God. After this, the people lost their standing before God; they could only come to God through the priests. Even those who had a heart to come to God were kept outside. The eleven tribes became those who were far from God, and only the Levites were the ones who drew near to God. The eleven tribes became those who could only come to God indirectly, whereas the Levites were the ones who could come to God directly. The eleven tribes became the ones who were served, while the Levites became the serving ones.</P><P>The book of Judges shows that the Levites became excessively honored because the Israelites could not serve, even if they had money. The Israelites had to ask the Levites to serve for them (Judg. 17), and it took a great effort for men to invite a Levite to serve in their house.</P>
