<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION AND SATAN&rsquo;S REBELLION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1&mdash;2:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE REVEALING CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals God, and it is the revelation of God. This revealed God is life, and life is the goal of everything that He does. Hence, we should take life as the central line when we read the Bible. For this reason, these chapters will not focus on interpretation or doctrines. Instead, we will consider the line of life in the Bible according to the essence of the Bible. If we read the Bible according to the line of life, we will see that the whole Bible reveals Christ as life. The first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, concerns the need for Christ to be life, and the second part of the Bible, the New Testament, concerns Christ being life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE AND PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 is a record of God&rsquo;s creation of the universe. Apparently, this portion reveals the existence of the universe and the origin of everything in it. This record of creation, however, is but a background, a footnote, that reveals God&rsquo;s desire and purpose. Hence, when we read the record of God&rsquo;s creation, we must not stop with the facts in Genesis but rather refer to the whole Bible in order to gain a thorough understanding of creation. In the first three chapters of this book we will first consider the process of God&rsquo;s creation. Then we will consider God&rsquo;s desire and purpose according to the spiritual significance of the process of creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL CREATION</h2>
<p>Many Bible scholars acknowledge that the record of God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 should be divided into two sections. In other words, the universe came into being through a two-step process, which includes God&rsquo;s original creation and His restoring and further creation.</p>
<p>Genesis is very brief concerning God&rsquo;s original creation. It only says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (1:1). However, we can see more concerning creation from other books of the Bible. We need to consider five points concerning God&rsquo;s original creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Motive for Creation</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation was not a sudden thought. The first sentence in the Bible is very brief, but Ephesians 1:5 and 9 reveal that God&rsquo;s creation came out of His good pleasure, His desire. In eternity past God had a desire, a good pleasure, to gain a universe in which He would accomplish His purpose. Such a desire and good pleasure became His motive for creating the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Creation</h2>
<p>God was not aimless when He created the universe; He had a purpose. Colossians reveals that all things were created in the Son of God&rsquo;s love, Christ: &ldquo;All things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him;...that He Himself might have the first place in all things&rdquo; (1:16-18). This shows that God&rsquo;s purpose for creating the universe is to glorify His Son. Verse 9 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;In Him [Christ] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, the Son&rsquo;s being glorified is the Father&rsquo;s being expressed. Hence, the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation is to glorify His Son. When the Son of God is glorified, God is expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis of Creation</h2>
<p>God had a motive and a purpose for creation, and He also had a basis for creation. Revelation 4:11 says that all things were and were created because of God&rsquo;s will. Based on His will, God planned creation. Hence, God created all things based on His will and plan. God had many considerations before He created the universe. He did not create the universe in haste. He had a motive, a purpose, and a basis for His creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Means of Creation</h2>
<p>The Hebrew word for <em>created</em> in Genesis 1:1 is <em>bara,</em> and it means to bring something into existence out of nothing. God&rsquo;s original creation was brought into existence out of nothing. How did God create the universe? What was the means by which the universe was created? Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; John 1:1-3 also says that all things came into being through the Word. God spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood (Psa. 33:9). God created the universe out of nothing by means of His word. God&rsquo;s word is mighty.</p>
<p>The Word of God is the Son of God. The Son of God is the Word who was in the beginning (John 1:1-2, 14). The Word of God is the manifested Son of God. For this reason, Colossians 1:15-16 says that all things were created in and through the Son of God. Hence, the means of God&rsquo;s creation is the Son of God (Heb. 1:2) and also the word of God (11:3; John 1:1-3). Christ is the Son of God and the Word of God (vv. 1, 18; Rev. 19:13).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
