   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN'S NATURAL CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HOLDING BACK THE LORD'S BLESSING HAND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that Joseph tried to hold back his father's blessing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that man's natural concept holds back the Lord's blessing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the church life, the Lord will raise up many we do not like, and some of them will become the best elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely I have had my human feelings, concepts, and tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But my natural concepts have been crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We simply do not know from which direction Saul of Tarsus will come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The one you think is the best may turn out to be the worst.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But one of the opposers will become today's Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although you do not like him, the Lord likes him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many will be raised up who do not fit your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Forget your selection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it did, there would be no need for predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason the New Testament nowhere records the names of the children of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the names of the spiritual sons are given.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul called Timothy his "child in faith" 1 Tim 1:2 and Titus his "genuine child according to the common faith" Titus 1:4 , and Peter spoke of "Mark my son" 1 Pet 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The names of the Apostles' children are not mentioned because not all of them were predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, we must also admit that not all our children have been predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, do not allow the matter of predestination to cause you to neglect the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To do that is to go to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not maneuver anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply bring the boys to God and let Him make the choice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not let your natural concept hold back the Lord's blessing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>JACOB'S SUPPLANTING HANDS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BECOMING BLESSING HANDS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jacob's supplanting hands eventually became blessing hands 25:26; 47:7, 10; 48:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter twenty-five we see that Jacob began his supplanting even when he was in his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How skillful he was in supplanting!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in chapters forty-seven and forty-eight we see that these two supplanting hands have become blessing hands, bringing people into God's presence and ministering God into people so that they may enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Would you have believed that Jacob's supplanting hands could become the blessing hands of a mature person?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see the growth and maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A supplanter, a heel-holder, became the greatest person on earth at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was able to bless Pharaoh because he had become greater than Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became this kind of person by the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need the growth in life and the maturity in life so that we may be filled with Christ to become those who are able to bless others.</S>
