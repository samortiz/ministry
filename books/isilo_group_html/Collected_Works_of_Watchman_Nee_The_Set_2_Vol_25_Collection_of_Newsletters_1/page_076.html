But I know that you are not for yourself but for the Lord and the brothers. So I think you must be doing this laborious work very happily. May the Father provide you everything.</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung is here and has a Bible study every evening concerning the matter of the church because the brothers in Hangchow need this kind of help now. May the Father bless this work so that the brothers will express the church life more.</P><P>With respect to the work here, I have been praying some before the Lord. As to the rest, I have left everything to the Lord's leading. However, in the past few days my flesh has been too active. When I have contacted people, I have not followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and have often acted according to the flesh. I have already repented for this sin before God. May God have mercy on me and give me the grace to stand in the place of death every day so that I will only act by the Holy Spirit. I bless you with peace in the Lord! Greet Brothers Witness Lee, Shen Ting Ling, and Chin T'ang for me.</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Tsai Ch'ing</P><P>The meeting in Hangchow:<br>Responsible brothers: Chiu Chung Man, Ma Ti Sheng<br>Meeting address: 321 Tung Chieh Road, Hangchow</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM CH'I HSIEN CH'IAO, P'U TUNG,<br>EAST OF SHANGHAI</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Watchman!</P><P>I have heard how you do not care for your life in your laboring for the Lord and that you have gotten sick. How have you been recently? I think of you often. I have been blessed by the Lord to leave the denominations which are condemned by God. According to my capacity in spiritual life and knowledge and the strength of my living, I would never dare to obey the Lord and leave the denominational way. But my heart would not have been peaceful if I had not left; therefore, I put all considerations aside and left the denominations.</P><P>The brothers and sisters are all well. Please do not worry about us. Their spiritual life, knowledge, and strength are all weak, but their desire is for the Lord. Now they are even more clear that the divisions in the denominations are of the flesh and are hated by the Lord. Although the number in our meetings is one third less than it was before we left the denominations, in the past five months, the amount of willing gifts in the offering box is already more than we received in a whole year prior to leaving the denomination.</P><P>This week we have more than ten brothers and sisters who will be baptized. We will also have a conference for several days. Please pray for it.</P><P>Some in the denominations oppose the fact that we do not allow women to pray or preach when there are both men and women in the congregation. They also oppose the matter of head covering. They use 1 Corinthians 11:5, "But every woman praying or prophesying..," and verse 15, "..because her long hair has been given to her for a covering," as a basis for their opposition. They think that it is all right for women to pray and preach in a congregation of both men and women. They also think that the woman's covering of long hair can be counted as a head covering.</P><P>I answered that 1 Corinthians 11:5 refers to a meeting of women where the sisters can pray or preach. Even then they still must cover their heads. If they do not, it is against the commandments in 1 Timothy 2:12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34-35. I also answered that believing women should not only cover their heads with long hair, but in a public meeting they should put on head coverings. First Corinthians 11:2-16 refers to what the sisters should do: (1) They cannot cut their hair or shave their heads (vv. 6, 15a); (2) they should cover their heads (vv. 6, 13); and (3) they should be in a position of submission (vv. 8-10). If a sister acts according to what the Bible says, she will gain more of the Lord's blessing and reward. I do not have enough Bible knowledge; I do not know if my answer to them was wrong or not.
