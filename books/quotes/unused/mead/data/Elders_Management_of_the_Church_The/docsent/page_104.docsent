   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS 2 I. Helping Others to Solve Their Problems</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In serving the Lord, everyone will sooner or later have some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These problems come from many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, some sisters have a genuine desire to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have been helped through the previous eight points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet their husbands are very much opposed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As far as their husbands' opposition is concerned, they can only stay at home and cannot come to the meeting or to the services.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How are you going to help such a one with her problem?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Take for example another brother who has the genuine calling to serve full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet he has a problem with his job.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Should he continue with his job?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Should he drop his job right away, or should he still continue in the job?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is true that this is a question between him and God, but you can see that he needs help here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another case is that of a brother whom you may feel is really suitable to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to his experience of grace and his condition in life, he is a good candidate to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet his job takes up all of his time from morning till evening.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, there is no way for him to serve as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How are you going to help him solve this problem of time?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again, there are other brothers and sisters who can serve and who should at the same time continue a job, yet their incomes are not enough for them to live by.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What should be done?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you can talk spiritually, saying, "Look to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I dislike this kind of light-hearted spiritual talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to help them solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again, there are those who really have a heart for the Lord and have learned some spiritual lessons, but they have some problem with their health.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their income is inadequate to provide an adequate diet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How are you going to help them to solve their problem?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot give some spiritual advice in the way of a spectator who is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is useless, and it will never help others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not to say that we should not trust in God, but there are some things that we should do ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, we need to help the brothers and sisters solve their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not an easy matter to manage a church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not do any of the things we have mentioned, we can still be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if we are to manage thoroughly, all these matters are things to be considered.</S>
