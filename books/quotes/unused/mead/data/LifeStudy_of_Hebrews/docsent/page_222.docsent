   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF IMITATING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can you imitate such a One?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot even make imitation tea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not try to produce an imitation tea, but simply drink real tea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every imitation is a falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Christianity, people are taught to imitate Christ, but it is impossible to imitate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are all familiar with artificial flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As plastic imitations of real flowers, they have the same color, shape, and appearance as genuine flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When they first came out, I liked them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after awhile I came to hate them because they have no life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man can imitate, but he cannot create.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord that while we cannot imitate Christ, He has a way of reproducing Himself in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SPREADING OF THE PROTOTYPE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INTO OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a factory, a company firstly manufactures a prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the mass production is according to that prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a good sense, our wonderful Christ is a prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s way is to put this prototype into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This living model is a living Person including divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a model, consisting of all these marvelous elements, has come into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The human, religious way is to correct or improve us from without.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s way is to put Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the Son of God, the Son of Man, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has put this wonderful Person into the very center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we agree and cooperate with this wonderful One, opening up to Him, He will spread outward into our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not imitation; it is the spreading of the prototype within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what the Bible calls sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ has come into us as the Son to be the life of the Son in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Romans 8:15, we have the spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have the sonship which makes us real sons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This sonship is actually the wonderful model Himself, the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have the life of the Son, the Spirit of the Son, and the sonship within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consider once again the illustration of a tea bag placed in a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we stir the water, the more it will be saturated with the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tea will spread into and mingle with the water until it becomes tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can imitate Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we could imitate Jesus, then a monkey could imitate a boy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is such a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can we imitate Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a matter of imitating Jesus; it is a matter of being saturated with the sonship, just as water is saturated with tea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son, as the very sonship, has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the sonship, He is the life, the Spirit, the position, and the right of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This sonship is now waiting for our cooperation that He might spread throughout our being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BECOMING THE FIRSTBORN SON</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In both Hebrews and Romans the matter of sonship is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Hebrews we are told that, after His first coming, Christ eventually became, through resurrection, the Firstborn Son 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before His incarnation He was the Only Begotten Son of God, but through resurrection He was born the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I read the Scriptures years ago, I was bothered by Psalm 2:7, which says, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse is quoted both in Acts 13:33 and in Hebrews 1:5.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being troubled by this, I asked myself, Wasn t Christ the Son of God already?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since He already was the Son of God, why did He need to be born of God in order to be the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Later I realized that before His incarnation, Christ was the Son of God without human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He was incarnated, He put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His divine element was the Son of God, but His human element was not.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, He had to be resurrected that His human element might be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through this birth, the Only Begotten Son of God became God s Firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, the Only Begotten Son did not have the humanity which had been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When He became the Firstborn Son of God, His humanity was born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way He became the Firstborn Son of God, and this Firstborn Son became the prototype, the model.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what it means to say that Christ is the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Firstborn Son is the prototype, and the many brothers are the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This model today is a living Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the totality of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When this living Person comes into us, we have the sonship and become a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we are the sons of God, and the Lord Jesus as the model is working and moving in us.</S>
