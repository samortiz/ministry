   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee THE DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE DEACONS' OFFICE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Witness Lee: We need to make some arrangements concerning deacons and the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we need to make some arrangements about the work of the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are two kinds of people serving in the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first is the person on duty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fourteen deacons should take turns in this duty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second is assistants.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are responsible for clerical work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are two requirements for the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, they must not be afraid of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should welcome trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are like the businessmen who are not afraid of more customers and more troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The deacons must be right in their motives.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some deacons are not right in their motives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When things get complicated and work gets busy, they have a wrong attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, the deacons cannot do things according to their own ways.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have to work according to the direction of the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are a housewife in a family, you are the only person taking care of the work in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no change of personnel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As such, you can do things absolutely according to your own will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the work in the church deacons' office is different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are not the master.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you cannot get through with something, you cannot change it at will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can fellowship with the responsible ones of the deacons' office, but you cannot change it suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The work in the deacons' office must be based on rules and procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It should not depend on the whims of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Except for special assignments, everyone should serve according to prearranged instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything has to be kept in the right place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This will make it easy for the next person to continue with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A deacon has to be aware of everything around him when he serves in the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a brother or sister comes to you and asks a question, as a serving one on duty you cannot say that you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if the brother asks you for a nail, you have to find it immediately, wherever it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For every question there may be fifty related questions, and you have to learn them all one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way you will be clear about everything, and you can answer any question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The assistants in the deacons' office must obey the one who is on duty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church fellowship meeting, the elders have to explain the relationship of the brothers and sisters to the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should encourage the brothers and sisters to fellowship with the serving ones in the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The deacons' office is not under the deacons, but under the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the elders must know everything that is occurring in the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They must make sure that all the items of service are taken care of properly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should not take care of them in the way of control, but in the way of assignment; they should assign the work to the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they find any preassigned arrangement in the deacons' office improperly done, they should not try to change it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, they should inform the responsible ones of the deacons' office and make the changes in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In principle, if anyone makes a mistake in the deacons' office, the elders cannot make the adjustments themselves; they have to ask those who committed the mistake to adjust it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the fellowship meeting, the elders have to let the brothers and sisters know that the serving ones on duty in the deacons' office are serving on behalf of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the brothers and sisters have to respect these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have to learn to go along absolutely with the arrangements in the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When an assignment comes to you from the deacons' office, you have to accept it mechanically; it is not a matter of seeking for leading.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You only need to move according to instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The serving ones on duty should also occupy themselves with some extra work at ordinary times; they should not be idle in any way.</S>
