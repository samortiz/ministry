<h1 class="title">THE DEVIL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 8:44; 1 John 5:19; 3:8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Everything in the universe has its opposite
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Positive and negative, up and down, good and evil, true and false, are opposites.</li>
	<li>White and black, light and darkness, heaven and earth, are also opposites.</li>
	<li>Hence, as there is a God, there must also be a Devil.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All the contradictions in the universe come from this opposition between God and the Devil
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since there exists both God and the Devil, a conflict occurs.</li>
	<li>All the opposite pairs such as good and evil, light and darkness, white and black, true and false, are contradictions existing in the universe.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All the tragedies and miseries in the universe originate from the Devil
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since there is not only God but also the Devil, there appear not only bright, good, and happy things, but also dark, evil, and miserable things.</li>
	<li>All the dark, evil, and miserable things come from the Devil.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All the sins of man come from the Devil
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>No one sins voluntarily and willingly, but everyone sins because he cannot help it.</li>
	<li>This is because the whole world lies in the hand of the Devil.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Devil, which is Satan, is the enemy of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The existence of falsehood proves the existence of truth in the same way that the existence of forged bank notes proves that there are genuine ones.</li>
	<li>The existence of a Devil proves the existence of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
