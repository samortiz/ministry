   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Walking within the room might be all right, I thought, but how could I walk downstairs?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I prayed to God, "Oh God, I can stand by faith, and by faith I am also able to walk downstairs!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Immediately, I went to the door leading to the staircase and opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I tell you honestly that when I stood at the top of the staircase it seemed to me to be the tallest staircase I had ever seen in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I said to God, "If You tell me to walk I will do so, even if I die as a result of the effort."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But I continued, "Lord, I cannot walk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I pray that You will support me with Your hand while I am walking."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With one hand holding onto the rail, I descended step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again I was in a cold sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As I walked down the stairs, I continued to cry out, "Walk by faith, walk by faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With each step down, I prayed, "Oh Lord, it is You who enable me to walk."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While descending those twenty-five steps, it seemed I was walking hand in hand with the Lord in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Upon reaching the bottom of the stairway, I felt very strong and went quickly to the rear door.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I opened the door and headed straight for Sister Lee's home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I said to the Lord, "From now on, I will live by faith and will no longer be an invalid."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I knocked at the door just as Peter did in Acts 12:12-17, but without Rhoda to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the door was opened and I entered the house, seven or eight brothers and sisters gazed at me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were speechless and motionless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For about an hour everyone sat quietly as if God had appeared among men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I also sat there full of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then I related all that had happened in the course of my being graciously healed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exhilarated and jubilant in spirit, we all praised God aloud for His wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That same day we hired a car to go to Kiang-Wan in the suburbs to visit Dora Yu, the famous woman evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She was greatly shocked to see me, for she had received recent news of my imminent death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I appeared, I was looked upon as one who had been raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was another occasion of joyful thanksgiving and praise before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the following Sunday, I spoke on the platform for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>About four years ago, I went to an auction at the house of a German doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Upon inquiring I found that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had taken three pictures and told me that there was no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I asked him to take another picture, he said that there was no further need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He then showed me another person's chest x-ray and said, "This person's condition was better than yours, yet he died at his home two weeks after this picture was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't come to see me anymore; I don't want to make money out of you."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I heard this, I went home extremely disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then, four years ago, I read an advertisement in the newspaper concerning the auction of a building and furniture of a certain famous German doctor who had died.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I discovered that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago, I lifted up my hands to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I said, "This doctor has died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He said that I would die soon, but now he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord has shown me His grace."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Under the Lord's blood, I said, "This doctor, who was stronger than I, has died, but I have been healed by the Lord and am still alive."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On that day I bought many things from his house for memorial.</S>
