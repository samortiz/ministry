   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HAVING PUT ON THE NEW MAN A. Corporate</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The new man is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is His Body, created in Him on the cross 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not individual, but corporate Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that the new man is created of two peoples proves that it is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, Colossians 3:10 and 11 reveal that the new man is a composition of many different peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this corporate new man there is no Greek or Jew, no bond or free, no barbarian or Scythian, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Colossians 3:11 the word all refers to people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that in the new man Christ is all the people and is in all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in the corporate new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The book of Ephesians reveals that the church is the Body of Christ 1:22-23 , the kingdom of God, the household of God 2:19 , and the temple, the dwelling place of God 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It reveals further that the church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the highest aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word for church, ekklesia, means those called out for a gathering, hence, an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the initial aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this the apostle goes on to the aspects of fellow-citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are higher than the initial aspect, but not as high as the aspect of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet the new man is still higher than the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God s children, nor even a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is in its uttermost aspect a new man to accomplish God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This new corporate person should live a life as Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of truth, expressing God and causing God to be realized as the reality by man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the new man is the focus of the apostle s exhortation in this section vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>17-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. Created according to God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 24 says that the new man was created according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The old man was created according to the image of God outwardly, without God s life and nature Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the new man was created according to God Himself inwardly, with God s life and nature Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. In Righteousness and Holiness of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the new man was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Righteousness is being right with God and with man according to God s righteous way, whereas holiness is being separated unto God from anything common and being saturated with God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Righteousness refers to the outward acts, whereas holiness refers to the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outwardly everything related to the new man is righteous; and inwardly everything related to the new man is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The righteousness and holiness of the new man are of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The article before truth in verse 24 is emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the deceit in verse 22, related to the old man, is the personification of Satan, so truth here, related to the new man, is the personification of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This truth was exhibited in the life of Jesus, as mentioned in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of truth were always being manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Deceit is the Devil, and truth is God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The old man is according to the lusts of the Devil, but the new man is in the righteousness and holiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a serious mistake to render the Greek word for truth here as an adjective.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The King James Version made such a mistake in adopting the rendering true holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here Paul s concept is not that of true holiness but that of the holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Holiness here is the holiness of the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The new man was created according to God in the righteousness and holiness of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order that we might learn Christ, Paul presents a sharp contrast between the old man and the new man, between the Devil and God, and between lusts, on the one hand, and righteousness and holiness, on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been taught that we have already put off the old man and have put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means we have put off the lusts and the falsehood of the Devil and have put on the righteousness and holiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This God is the truth, and this truth is seen in the living of Jesus on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The human living of Jesus was according to the truth, that is, according to God Himself, full of righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praise the Lord that we have learned Christ as the truth is in Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we learn Christ by putting off the old man and by putting on the new man, we shall be in the church life, for the new man actually is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus, then we can have a genuine, proper, and practical church life.</S>
