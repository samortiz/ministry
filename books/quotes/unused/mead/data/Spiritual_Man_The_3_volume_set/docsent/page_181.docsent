   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The reason for this is none other than differences in the degree of the knowledge of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If, according to the conscience of a believer, a certain thing is permitted, and he does it, he is doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if the conscience of another believer does not permit the same thing, he will sin if he does it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we said before, this does not mean that the highest will of God is different, but that God leads each one according to his respective position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One who has knowledge has a stronger conscience; consequently, he has more liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One who is without knowledge is weaker; consequently, he is more restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This matter is clearly taught by the apostle in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, the believers in Corinth had many misunderstandings about the matter of eating things offered to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some thought that idols were nothing and that the food could be eaten, whether or not it was offered to idols, since God is one and there is no other God 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others, before they were believers, had been idol worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when they saw that the food they were eating had been offered to idols, they could not help remembering the past.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consequently their conscience was not at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they ate, they were defiled because their conscience was weak v. 7 . The apostle understood that this distinction was caused by the presence or absence of knowledge v. 7 . The former, because of their knowledge, were not rebuked by their conscience; therefore, after eating, they did not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The latter, because of their lack of knowledge, were not at peace in their conscience; therefore, their eating became their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we see that knowledge is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>More knowledge can sometimes cause the conscience to condemn more, but it can also cause the conscience to have less condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in similar matters of the shadows of the things to come, we should ask the Lord to grant us more knowledge so that we will not be unreasonably bound.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, such knowledge should be kept with a humble heart; otherwise, we will fall into the flesh like the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our knowledge is inadequate and the conscience still rebukes, we still have to obey the voice of the conscience no matter how great a price we have to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think that because this is not wrong according to the highest standard, that we do not need to care for the conscience and can just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should remember that the conscience is the current standard of God's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should obey; disobeying is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is condemned by our conscience is certainly condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have spoken concerning outward things such as food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning more spiritual things, regardless of how much knowledge we possess, there can never be the difference of freedom or bondage to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is spoken of here concerns outward things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's dealing with His children is according to their age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Towards young believers, God is very concerned about outward things such as eating, clothing, and so on because God wants to put to death the evil deeds of their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If young believers have the heart to follow the Lord, they will see that the Lord often causes them to subdue these things through the conscience of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who have more experience in the Lord, because they know how to submit to the Lord, seem to have a little more freedom in their conscience.</S>
