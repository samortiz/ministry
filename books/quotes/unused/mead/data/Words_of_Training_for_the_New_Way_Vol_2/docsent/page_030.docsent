   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE CONCERNING THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This morning we will study the way to take care of small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since October of 1984 when we first mentioned the change of the system, we have been practicing small group meetings here in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time, we had a slogan: The heaven can be annulled, and the earth can pass away, but the small group meeting must not be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Afterwards, we were divided into four hundred small groups, and the number of attendants was between three thousand and thirty-five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After promoting these groups for more than a year, from 1985 to the spring of 1986, the number of attendants in the small group meetings rose to over five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From this we can see the effectiveness of small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BRINGING THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>TO THE EXISTING SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the second half of 1986, we began to conduct formal trainings, and we tried our best to bring the local saints into those trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time there were over a thousand saints who had attended the evening trainings at various times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most of these were the nucleus of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The four hundred small groups were on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As soon as they came forward to attend the training, the small groups were left untended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, during the last year, although the small groups still existed, they were in a situation where they were left to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In spite of this, these first small groups are still a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are still quite useful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At present in the church in Taipei there are about thirty-five hundred saints who attend meetings regularly in the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number of those who were brought in through gospel preaching by door-knocking in the communities and who have meetings every week is about two thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two groups comprise more than six thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not much of a problem for those who have been meeting in the halls to come to the group meetings or district meetings, because they are accustomed to them already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, of the two thousand new ones, only seven to eight hundred are willing to go to the district meetings; the rest are not willing to leave their homes to meet in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under these circumstances, we cannot expect these new ones to raise up small groups within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we still need to take those who originally attended the meetings in the halls as a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By making a new arrangement for these small groups, we can gradually bring the new ones into them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, the housing situation in Taipei is very different from what it used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the old days, we mostly had single houses clearly separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But now, we have large apartment buildings within which are many dwelling units.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we have meetings with singing and praying in the homes, it is difficult not to disturb the neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, it is not easy to open up a new place for meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, it is also quite difficult to ask the new ones to willingly open up their homes to have group meetings week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, a meeting place for the small groups also becomes a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As for the original four hundred groups, because they had been established a long time ago, the neighbors are more accustomed to the noise of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, we still need to utilize the original groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, it does not mean that we should never set up new small groups in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our newly baptized ones live far away from the existing groups, or if there is not a group that is suitable for them, it would not be easy to bring them to the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such cases, we have to open up new small groups for them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This matter is related to the exercise and practice in our training.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you go to take care of home meetings and from the home meetings develop small group meetings, you need to consider the practical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For those living in remote places, there is the need to establish new small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not necessary for the training center to promote this, nor is it necessary for the elders or the district leaders to arrange for this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You workers need to make the decision according to the practical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the change of the system, our principle is freedom of development.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since you are the ones taking care of the home meetings in a practical way, and you understand their actual situation, you can work according to the practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the new ones live far away from the original small groups and it becomes difficult for them to attend, you need to set up new small groups for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If their situation is not appropriate, and if no one has picked up the burden to start a new group, you need to help them travel a little farther to go to the most suitable place to attend group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They can see the meeting for themselves and have a taste.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, they will be raised up gradually and will have the desire to establish small groups.</S>
