Although there are still many lessons to learn and many things to know, the Lord is willing to be seen by the maiden, to be held by her, and to be taken away by her. In the present stage of dealing, she has passed through sufficient trials; her pursuit is sufficient. Since she has not yet learned to separate the soul from the spirit, the Lord does not put any further burden on her.</P><P>"Until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me." Although there is a mixture of the self, the Lord is willing to humble Himself and allow her to enjoy His presence once more. The Lord enters her mother's house and the inner chamber of the one who conceived her. If "my mother's house" refers to the principle of grace, then "the chamber of her that conceived me" must refer to the love of God. God deals with her according to the principle of grace and in His love. (When we were sinners, we were conceived in lusts and born in sin. The maiden is conceived in love and born in grace.) She now seeks after the Lord's presence according to His grace and love. Poetically speaking, she is now bringing the Lord to an intimate place. She is a maiden, and her mother's house and the chamber of the one who conceived her must be a most excellent place.</P><P>This concludes another section. She has a good enjoyment of the Lord's presence. But this is not perfection yet.</P><P>The Lord is still being pursued; He is still the passive One. The maiden has not learned how to allow the Lord to have His freedom. But she has learned many lessons. She remains here for a period of time (perhaps a few months). A person finds the holding strength the strongest when he regains the Lord after losing Him for a while.</P><P>Verse 5 says, "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please." The Lord is giving a charge again. Since she has suffered great testing, the Lord gives her a period of rest. He is saying, "This person is under My dealing. There is no need for others to help her or stir her up." The lesson she learns here is real, and a period of real progress follows. From what follows, we can see that she has indeed experienced the power of resurrection, the riches of resurrection, and the life of the cross (though not in an absolute way). She has learned these three lessons well. Therefore, the Lord praises her with the words that follow.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
