   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thirdly, in both chapters we have God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's promise to Abraham is repeated in His promise to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's promise to Jacob in chapter twenty-eight was indefinite.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 28:14 God said, "Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I had been Jacob, I would have said, "Lord, I don't want my descendants to be dust.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of millions of particles of dust, I would rather have a few kings."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God's promise in chapter twenty-eight speaks of dust, His promise in chapter thirty-five speaks of kings and nations v. 11 . A nation denotes a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's promise in 35:11 is a repetition of His promise in 17:6.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In both instances, He promised that nations and kings would come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Jacob's dream at Bethel, God told him that his seed would be as dust.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now, in the actual experience at Bethel in chapter thirty-five, God's promise has advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here, there is no mention of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of dust there are nations with kings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The focus of the promise in this chapter is to be fruitful and multiply to bring forth nations with kings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, Genesis 17 and 35 correspond to each other in three respects: in the revelation of the divine title, the all-sufficient God; in the changing of human names; and in the promise of multiplication for bringing forth nations with kings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we can see the purpose of the title the all-sufficient God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The all-sufficient God is for the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to take in this word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The all-sufficient God is for the building of Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is all-sufficient for the church life, for the building of His house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot experience the all-sufficient God in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to experience the all-sufficient God, you must be in Bethel, in the house of God, in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This truth is proved by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before we came to the church life, many of us had some experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But as we all can testify, we did not experience God as the all-sufficient One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although I experienced God in various aspects, I did not experience Him as the all-sufficient One until I came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after being in the church life for many years, I can say, "Hallelujah, what an experience of the all-sufficient God I have in the church life!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is too all-sufficient to be experienced by just a few individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As individuals, we are too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's all-sufficiency requires a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need the house in order to experience this aspect of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recently, we had a marvelous prayer meeting here in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe that that meeting will stand as a memorial for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the utterances in the prayers were unique.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our prayers we prayed about the travailing woman and about the prevailing, victorious man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We could never have prayer like this alone in our rooms; we must be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any local saints who missed that prayer meeting certainly missed a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an experience, not of Elohim or of Jehovah, but of the all-sufficient God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In that prayer meeting I was above the third heaven enjoying the all-sufficient God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only in the church life is it possible to realize the all-sufficiency of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I hear of the opposition from our critics, I do not feel hateful toward them; rather, I feel full of pity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How much they are missing!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their traditional religion is frustrating them and keeping them from God's up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What an all-sufficient God we are experiencing in His present move!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not a teaching or a doctrinal understanding; it is our experience of God in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The all-sufficient God is revealed for the building of Bethel and He is experienced in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Testament interpretation of the Old Testament term "the house of God" is "the church."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul said, "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For us today, Bethel is not history; it is the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bethel in the Old Testament is a type of the practical experience of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What poverty there is in today's Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most Christians think of Bethel as past history.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They do not realize that the church life today is Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The reason that they do not understand this is that they do not have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise the Lord that in the Lord's recovery we have the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church life, our experience of the all-sufficient God is increasing day by day and even minute by minute.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our church life in Anaheim has greatly increased in the last two years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you compare January, 1977 with January, 1975, you will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Surely, 1977 will be a great year in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In October of this year there will be in Taipei an international conference of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only the Lord knows what will happen at that time, or even next week.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that some very significant things are about to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church life is marching on; it is advancing day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many of us can testify that the church life has advanced since this afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah, the all-sufficient God is for the church life, today's Bethel!</S>
