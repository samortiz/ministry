   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIVERSAL DIMENSIONS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dimensions of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These dimensions are the dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only God Himself knows the measurements of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can measure the distance from one point in the universe to another, for example, from the earth to the moon, but we cannot measure the universe itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now the very dimensions of the universe are also the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is our real universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Elsewhere we have pointed out that Christ is our earth, our good land, and also our sun and morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now, according to verse 18, we have the boldness to say that Christ is our universe, for His dimensions are the dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:23 speaks of the fullness of Him who fills all in all, and 4:9 and 10 reveal that He who descended into the lower parts of the earth also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we enter into the new heaven and the new earth to dwell in the New Jerusalem, we all shall realize that Christ the Lord is our universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>EXPERIENCING THE BREADTH AND LENGTH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our experience of Christ, we firstly experience the breadth of what He is, and then we experience the length.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is horizontal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we advance in Christ, we experience the height and depth of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Firstly we experience Christ spreading as the breadth and the length.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later we experience Him rising up as the height and finally descending as the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we shall see, our experience of Christ must eventually become three-dimensional, like a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have only the length of Christ, without any breadth, our experience will be a line, that is, an experience that is long and narrow to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our experience of Christ, however, should not have only one dimension, like a line, but it should have two dimensions, like a square, and then three dimensions, like a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is of great importance that we all have a two-dimensional, or a square, experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have only a line experience of Him, this line will eventually continue until it reaches an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All extremists are one-liners, those whose experience of Christ is on a single line.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you experience Christ properly and normally as the breadth and the length, you will be kept from going to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not go too far out on the line of a narrow and long experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, experience Him in a square way as the breadth and as the length.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By experiencing Christ continually as the breadth and length, our experience will be like a solidly woven carpet, not a long, single thread.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some examples will help to make this matter clear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For a number of years, I listened to a certain great Bible teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was extremely knowledgeable in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although he spent very little time in prayer, he was constantly reading the Word and writing notes in his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After talking about the Bible for a period of time, he would excuse himself in order to smoke his pipe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he would resume his discussion of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With him there was a line of only one dimension an extreme emphasis on studying the Bible but there was not the normal spreading of Christ in two dimensions as a square in his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A sister in my home town also had a line experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She did not read the Bible, but devoted a great deal of time to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Being extremely earnest in prayer, she decided to fast and pray for many days.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the seventh day some of the brothers and sisters came to me very concerned about her situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we visited her, she was in bed, weakened because of seven days of fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We encouraged her to take care of her health, but she was offended by our suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the very next day, she died.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is an example of how a line experience can lead people to an extreme, even lead them astray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sooner or later every line experience leads astray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we need to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These two examples show that we need to take time both to pray and to study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Another extreme experience relates to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not long ago some among us decided that they no longer needed the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They preferred simply to enjoy the Lord at home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is nothing wrong with enjoying the Lord in our homes, but we should not stretch such an experience until it becomes an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others, on the contrary, care only for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In their Christian life they reserve no time for prayer, for Bible study, or for enjoying the Lord at home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All they care about is the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This also is an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How easy it is to have line experiences of a single dimension!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seems that not many saints desire the two-dimensional experiences, like a carpet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to have an experience of Christ like a solidly woven carpet, we need to be balanced in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be balanced is to be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need both the breadth and the length; we need the two-dimensional, square, experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to experience Christ in His universal dimensions, we need the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to experience Christ with all the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In particular, we need the church meetings, for in the meetings we are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through messages and the testimonies of the saints, we are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we experience the dimensions of Christ in the church life, we shall gradually be woven into a carpet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We shall not be thin lines of thread.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is needed today is not lines of thread, but a carpet woven through the balanced experience of Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we experience Christ in this way, we find that His breadth and length are immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is immeasurable in His spreading forth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we experience Christ in His spreading, we come to see that the dimensions of the universe are the very dimensions of Christ.</S>
