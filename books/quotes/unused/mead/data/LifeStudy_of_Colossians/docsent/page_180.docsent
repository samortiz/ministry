   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Hebrews 6:19 and 20 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Forerunner, the Pioneer, who has cut the way into glory within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be within the veil is to be in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As our Forerunner, our Pioneer, Christ is now in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE HIGH PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Hebrews also reveals that Christ is our High Priest, the One who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens Heb 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Hebrews 4:14 we are told that we have a great High Priest Who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As our heavenly High Priest, He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we call on the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we sense that something from the heavens is being transmitted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Often this divine transmission causes us to be beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we have such a High Priest interceding for us, we should come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help Heb 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The things which are above include the ministry of intercession of our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of His intercession, we may receive mercy and grace for our timely need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of Christ s intercession in the heavens, we are also stirred up to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our path is under the direction of the transmission from the heavens, the transmission which comes from the intercession of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are tempted to pursue some worldly entertainment instead of attending the church meeting, this heavenly transmission may direct us to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of us can testify that we have been under the direction of Christ s intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The intercession of our High Priest is another aspect of the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE HEAVENLY MINISTER</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, according to Hebrews 8:1 and 2, Christ is also a Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is our heavenly Minister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are asked what church we go to and who our minister is, the best answer is to reply that our church is in the heavens and that our minister is the heavenly Jesus, who is ministering in a tabernacle pitched by the Lord and not by man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This tabernacle, this sanctuary, is the third heaven, the heavenly Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord that the Holy of Holies in the heavens is connected to our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, in experience, our regenerated spirit is also the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit is thus connected to the third heaven, where Christ is ministering on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE LAMB ON THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the book of Revelation we see even more of the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What we have in this book is not merely a window, but an opened heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Heaven was opened to John, and he saw a throne set in heaven, and One sitting upon the throne Rev 4:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This throne is not simply the throne of grace, but is the very throne of authority, the throne of the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Revelation 4:5 John goes on to say, And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John also tells us that in the midst of the throne he saw a Lamb: And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John s vision in chapters four and five of Revelation is related to God s administration today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From John s vision we realize that heaven is neither silent nor without activity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, from His throne God is carrying out His administration over the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lamb, the Redeemer, the very One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne and has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
