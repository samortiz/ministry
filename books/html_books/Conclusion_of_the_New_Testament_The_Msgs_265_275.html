Beginning with this message, we will consider another matter-Christ as our experience, enjoyment, and expression. In the New Testament there are more than three hundred aspects of the experience, enjoyment, and expression of Christ. We look to the Lord that, as we study all these aspects, He will bring us into the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (Phil. 3:8). In this excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we will surely enter into the rich experience and enjoyment of Him. Then we will have the expression of Him on earth in His recovery.<h2 class=head1>I. IN THE GOSPELS</h2><p>We begin with the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew.<h2 class=head2>A. Experiencing and Enjoying Him as:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Son of David</h2><p>The New Testament opens with these words: &#8220;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham&#8221; (Matt. 1:1). In this verse there are two titles of Christ: Son of David and Son of Abraham. It is significant that the very first verse of the New Testament mentions these two titles.<p>If we know the New Testament as a whole, we will realize that the entire New Testament is wrapped up with these two titles. In Revelation 22:16 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as &#8220;the Root and the Offspring of David.&#8221; In His divinity, Christ is the &#8220;Root of David,&#8221; his source; in His humanity, He is the &#8220;Offspring of David,&#8221; his issue. Hence, He is the Lord of David as the Root, and He is also the seed, the branch, of David as the Offspring (Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Jer. 23:5). We may now experience, enjoy, and express Him as such a One.<p>We may think that Matthew 1:1 is simply a revelation telling us how Christ came into mankind through being the Son of Abraham and the Son of David. However, the titles Son of David and Son of Abraham are not just for us to know the revelation concerning Christ&#8217;s person. These titles are for us to experience, enjoy, and express Christ.<p>Christ is the Son of David (Matt. 9:27; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9). Solomon, the son of David, was a type of Christ in three main aspects. First, he was a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom (2 Sam. 7:12b, 13b; Jer. 23:5; Luke 1:32-33). Second, Solomon had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In Matthew 12 Christ, the greater Solomon (v. 42), also had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. Third, Solomon built the temple of God (2 Sam. 7:13a). As the Son of David, Christ builds up God&#8217;s temple, the church.<h2 class=head4>a. To Bring Us into the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The Son of David signifies the kingdom. Christ, the Son of David, is the King, the Ruler. As the Son of David, Christ brings us into the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:3).<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Participate in the Divine Authority</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s being the Son of David is also for us to participate in the divine authority. According to the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord has given us the authority to bind and to loose. &#8220;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens&#8221; (16:19). The Gospel of Matthew is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority. The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom to reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church in 16:19, but also to the church itself (18:17-18).<p>Matthew 28:18-19 is another portion of the Word which reveals that we participate in the divine authority. &#8220;Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Because all authority has been given to the Lord Jesus, the Son of David as the heavenly King, He has sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations. They go with His authority.<h2 class=head3>2. The Son of Abraham</h2><p>Christ is also the Son of Abraham. In the Old Testament there was a clear prophecy that Christ would be the son of Abraham.<p>Isaac, the son of Abraham, was a type of Christ in three main aspects. First, Isaac brought the blessing to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16, 14). Second, Isaac was offered to God unto death and was resurrected (Gen. 22:1-12; Heb. 11:17, 19). Third, Isaac received the bride (Gen. 24:67). This is a type of Christ as the promised One who brought the blessing to all nations, who was offered to God unto death, who was resurrected, and who will receive His bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7).<h2 class=head4>a. To Bring Us the Divine Blessing</h2><p>As the Son of Abraham, Christ brings us the divine blessing. Concerning this, Galatians 3:14 says, &#8220;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221; The blessing here is that promised by God to Abraham (Gen. 12:3). This promise has been fulfilled, and this blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross.<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Inherit God</h2><p>Christ, the Son of Abraham, brings us the divine blessing for us to inherit God. Galatians 3:29 says, &#8220;If you are of Christ, then you are Abraham&#8217;s seed, heirs according to promise.&#8221; Abraham&#8217;s seed is only one, Christ (v. 16). Hence to be Abraham&#8217;s seed we must be Christ&#8217;s, a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we are Abraham&#8217;s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God&#8217;s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be our portion.<p>Acts 26:18 refers to the believers&#8217; divine inheritance. This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (1:12).<p>Ephesians 1:13 and 14 reveal that the Spirit is &#8220;the pledge of our inheritance.&#8221; Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge of this inheritance to us.<p>In the Old Testament God made seven covenants with mankind. Two of the most important covenants are the covenants with Abraham and with David. In order to understand how we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Son of David and the Son of Abraham, we need to consider these two covenants.<p>The covenant God made with Abraham concerned God&#8217;s coming to be the blessing to His chosen people. This covenant is related to God&#8217;s purpose in creating man. God made mankind to be His vessels to contain Him. God made man in His own image and after His likeness so that man could contain God, taking God as his life and life supply. For man to take God as his life and life supply is the greatest blessing in the universe. This is the enjoyment of the Triune God. However, due to the fall, this great blessing was lost by man.<p>Although man fell, God could not give up His eternal purpose. Satan&#8217;s doings cannot annul God&#8217;s purpose. The created race had fallen, but God continued working to fulfill His purpose by coming to a chosen race. The created race, the race of Adam, was a failure, so God came to another race, the chosen race, the race of Abraham. Whereas Adam was the head of the created race, Abraham was the head of the chosen race.<p>God made a covenant with Abraham, and this covenant concerns God&#8217;s being the enjoyment and everything to His chosen people. Galatians 3:14 indicates that the New Testament is the fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. In this fulfillment the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing to God&#8217;s chosen people. In the gospel we have received the all-inclusive Spirit as God&#8217;s consummation to be the life, life supply, and everything for our enjoyment. As a result of the covenant God made with Abraham, the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit has become our enjoyment.<p>Galatians 3:29 tells us that because we are Christ&#8217;s, we are Abraham&#8217;s seed, heirs according to promise. What will we inherit? We will inherit the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit. If we realize this, we will understand why Christ had to be the Son of Abraham. Christ had to be the Son of Abraham to fulfill God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham so that God, after being processed, could be our blessing. Now for us to enjoy Christ as the Son of Abraham means that we enjoy the Triune God promised to Abraham. This is a matter of blessing.<p>If we study the history in the Old Testament, we will see that after God made the covenant with Abraham, His people had failure after failure and defeat after defeat. The blessing could not come because the earth was full of rebellion against God. Therefore, God came to a man according to His heart (1 Sam. 13:14), David, the son of Jesse, and made a covenant with him (2 Sam. 7:12-17). Whereas the covenant with Abraham concerned the blessing, the covenant with David concerned the kingdom. God must have a kingdom, a realm, a sphere, on earth with His chosen race to exercise His administration under His full, divine authority. Without such a kingdom, God does not have a realm in which to accomplish His purpose. In order to be the blessing to His chosen people, God needs a kingdom, a realm, filled with His authority. Then in this administration He can come in to exercise whatever is on His heart to be the blessing promised to His chosen people.<p>It would be helpful at this point to consider how the gospel is presented to us in the New Testament. It is presented first with these words: &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&#8221; (Matt. 4:17). This indicates that the gospel is presented first not in the way of life, as in John, but in the way of the kingdom, as in Matthew. The reason for this is that there is the need of a kingdom, a realm, a sphere, for God to exercise Himself to give us His all-inclusive being. Even in John, the Gospel of life, we are told that if we are not regenerated, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5). There is the need of a kingdom so that God can exercise Himself to dispense Himself into us as our life blessing. Therefore, in the gospel we receive Jesus Christ first not as life but as the King.<p>In Matthew we have the King-Savior; in Mark, the Slave-Savior; in Luke, the Man-Savior; and in John, the God-Savior. If we do not repent and receive the Lord as the King-Savior, we cannot have Him as the Slave-Savior, the Man-Savior, and the God-Savior.<p>We need to repent not only because we are sinful but also because we are rebellious. We are even enemies of God. We need to repent of our rebellion. We sin because we are rebellious. If we did not rebel, we could not sin. Because we are rebels, we need to repent and receive Christ as our authority, as our Sovereign and King, that He may rule in us and over us in God&#8217;s kingdom. This is the reason that in Matthew 1:1 Christ is presented first not as the Son of Abraham for the blessing but as the Son of David for the kingdom.<p>Once there is the kingdom, the kingdom becomes the realm, the sphere, for God to exercise Himself to bless us. We all like to receive the blessing, but we may not realize that the blessing requires a sphere of God&#8217;s authority, a sphere under God&#8217;s administration. Without such a sphere, there is no way for God to come in to bless us. If we are not under God&#8217;s administration, receiving Him as our Sovereign, there is no way for Him to bless us. Therefore, in our experience our Savior, Jesus Christ, must first be the Son of David for the kingdom and then the Son of Abraham for the blessing.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that we must receive Christ first as the Son of David and then as the Son of Abraham. To receive Him as the Son of David is to recognize His kingly status and to realize that we should be under His kingship and sovereignty. He comes to us not merely as the Savior but as the King-Savior. If He is not the King to us, He cannot be our Savior. If we are not under His authority, His administration, we cannot be saved. Salvation comes to us under His administration, under His kingship. If we say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, I take You as my King,&#8221; we will be saved to the uttermost.<p>If we have Christ as the Son of David, the greater Solomon, we will also have Him as the Son of Abraham, the real Isaac. This means that if we have the kingdom, we will also have the blessing. This is the blessing of life, the blessing of the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit. Many of us can testify that by receiving Christ as our King we enjoy the processed Triune God as our blessing. The more we are under the Lord&#8217;s ruling, the more we enjoy the Triune God as our blessing.<p>Matthew 28:19 speaks of the believers&#8217; being baptized into the Triune God-into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. This is the enjoyment of the Triune God. As the Son of David and the Son of Abraham, Christ brings us into the Triune God. As long as we have the Son of David and the Son of Abraham, we have the Triune God, and we are in the Triune God. This is the divine blessing in the divine kingdom.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head3>3. Christ</h2><p>In the previous message we saw that the Lord Jesus is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham. Now we must go on to see that He is also Christ. The title Christ is emphasized in Matthew 1:16 to prove that Jesus is the very Christ, the Messiah, prophesied in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head4>a. God&#8217;s Anointed-Messiah</h2><p>Concerning Jesus&#8217; being the Christ, John 1:41 says, &#8220;He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).&#8221; Messiah is Hebrew; Christ is Greek. Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos. Both Messiah in Hebrew and Christos in Greek mean &#8220;the anointed One.&#8221; The term Messiah, the anointed One, is used in Daniel 9:26: &#8220;After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing.&#8221; This refers to Jesus Christ, who is the anointed One. Christ is God&#8217;s Anointed, the One appointed by God to accomplish God&#8217;s purpose, His eternal plan.<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Participate in His Kingship</h2><p>Jesus is the Christ for us to participate in His kingship (Rev. 20:4b, 6b). Our receiving the Lord Jesus as the King-Savior does not only bring us into the kingdom of God; it also brings us into the participation in Jesus&#8217; kingship. In other words, our receiving the King-Savior makes us part of the King. We, then, become His co-kings. Even today, all believers who walk in the divine way are kings, and the divine authority is with them. With such believers there is something special-the divine kingship. Therefore, we may experience and enjoy Christ as the One who brings us into the participation in His kingship.<h2 class=head3>4. Jehovah Our Savior</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is Jehovah our Savior. Matthew 1:21 says, &#8220;She will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.&#8221; The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah. Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means &#8220;Jehovah the Savior,&#8221; or &#8220;the salvation of Jehovah.&#8221; Therefore, Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our Savior, our salvation.<h2 class=head4>a. Through Incarnation</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is God incarnate. It was through incarnation that He, Jehovah, became Jehovah our Savior. Jehovah means &#8220;I Am&#8221; (Exo. 3:14). Only God is the eternal One. From eternity past to eternity future, He is the I Am. Because the Lord Jesus is Jehovah incarnate, He could say of Himself, &#8220;Before Abraham came into being, I am&#8221; (John 8:58). Through incarnation Jehovah became our Savior.<h2 class=head4>b. To Save Us from Our Sins</h2><p>As Jehovah our Savior the Lord Jesus saves us from our sins. He saves us from our sin and sins, from all the besetting sins in our daily life, from the evil power of Satan, from everything God condemns, and from all negative things. Day by day we may experience, enjoy, and even express Christ as our Savior and as our salvation, saving us from every sin, both small and great. Whenever we call upon Him to save us, He is Jehovah our Savior, Jehovah our salvation.<h2 class=head3>5. Emmanuel-God with Us</h2><h2 class=head4>a. In His Humanity</h2><p>We may also experience and enjoy Christ as Emmanuel. &#8220;&#8216;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,&#8217; (which is translated, God with us)&#8221; (Matt. 1:23). In His humanity, Jesus, God incarnate, is Emmanuel, God with us. Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man. Jesus the Savior is God with us. He is God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God but God with us. Without Him we cannot meet God, for He is God. Without Him we cannot find God, for He is God incarnate. Therefore, when we call on the Lord Jesus, we have the sense that God is with us.<h2 class=head4>b. For God to Meet Our Need in Every Way</h2><p>Christ is the complete God becoming a perfect man. Hence, He is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing genuine divinity and real humanity. As the almighty God, He has the capacity in His divinity and the capacity in His humanity to meet all of our need in every way. We need Him in His divine capacity that we may be divine as He is. We need Him in His humanity that we may be human as He is in the highest standard of humanity. Therefore, by Him, with Him, and in Him we can be not only a proper and uplifted man but also a God-man, a divine man, as He is. He is divine becoming human that we may be human becoming divine. He is now humanly divine to make us divinely human. In this way He, as the all-inclusive One, meets our need adequately and sufficiently in the most superior way.<p>Christ passed through the processes of incarnation and resurrection in order to dispense Himself into us. Through incarnation Christ could be Emmanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us. His being with us outwardly does not fulfill His purpose to dispense Himself into our being, so He had to go through another process. The second process was His death and resurrection. In resurrection His physical form became a spiritual form. Through death and resurrection, He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He is Emmanuel, the presence of the Divine Trinity. This presence is always with us in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), not only day by day but also moment by moment. To live with Christ, we need to be in His divine presence (Gal. 5:25a). The divine presence is the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. This presence is Emmanuel, who is the real, practical Jesus, the Triune God with the tripartite man.<p>We live with Christ as Emmanuel and walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In order to walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we must live with Christ as a person, who is Emmanuel. Today Emmanuel is the very life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God as His presence with us moment by moment. We have to realize that all day long we have another One with us. He is not only with us outwardly but also with us inwardly in our spirit every minute of the day. We do and say things one way when we are alone, but when we have someone else with us, we do and say things differently. We must ask ourselves, &#8220;Are we doing things in our own way, or are we doing things in another way because we realize that another One is with us?&#8221; If we realize that another One is with us, everything we do will change.<p>There are very few Christians who walk, live, speak, and do things with Emmanuel as another One with them. We have the doctrine of Emmanuel, but we have very little experience of Emmanuel. If we had more experience of Emmanuel, we would not do many of the things we do today, such as gossip. The presence of the Lord changes our life. We all must have the realization and sensation that the Lord Jesus, who is our Savior, is also Emmanuel. He is the Triune God with us, the tripartite men. We should not say or do anything in ourselves or by ourselves. We need to experience Emmanuel.<p>Living with Christ is not I living alone but with Christ living in me (Gal. 2:20). If you live every day and every moment by yourself, you are defeated. You must realize that you are no longer living alone, but Christ is living with you and in you. When you have this sensation, it will revolutionize your entire life.<p>To live with Christ, we still live, yet not by ourselves alone but by Christ living with us as Emmanuel. The name Emmanuel is first mentioned in Isaiah (7:14; 8:8). Many Christians address the Lord as Jesus and Christ, but few address the Lord as Emmanuel. We must learn to call our Lord, &#8220;Emmanuel.&#8221;<h2 class=head3>6. A Nazarene</h2><p>In His human living the Lord Jesus was a despised Nazarene. Matthew 2:23 says that Joseph &#8220;came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.&#8221; The title Nazarene may refer to the branch in Isaiah 11:1, which in Hebrew is netzer. The branch there, signifying Christ, is a sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the father of David. By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown. This means that the royal stem, stump, of David had been cut off. Now a new twig sprouted from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots. The sprouting and growing of this twig were in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, and He did not grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem. He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town. All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch-not a lofty branch of a stately tree but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse.<p>Because the Lord Jesus was a despised Nazarene who was born in a poor home and raised up in a despised city, He could contact every kind of man. If He had been born as a king, few would have been able to approach Him. But He was born as a poor man, and He could and did approach every class of men, especially the poor and sick ones, such as the blind, the lepers, the sinners, and the tax collectors. He became their Friend to cherish them.<h2 class=head4>a. The One Rejected by the World</h2><p>As the Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was the One rejected by the world (Matt. 2:13b, 21-22). The Lord Jesus truly was the Most High God and the genuine royal descendant of the great king David. According to His status in both His divinity and His humanity, He should have been highly regarded and greatly exalted. But due to the way He was born and the environment in which He was born, there was no sign that He should have been regarded and exalted. In addition, His physical appearance did not bear any beauty or form that could be attractive to human eyes. Furthermore, His way of living was not to make a show of Himself, and His way of working was quite peculiar to the human concept. In His lowly humanity, He concealed all the excellent aspects of both His divine and human status. Hence, He was absolutely rejected by the worldly people according to their worldly view.<h2 class=head4>b. The One Despised by Men</h2><p>As a Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was also the One despised by men. He was called Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene. When Philip met Jesus, he knew that Jesus was the Messiah. Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man from Nazareth. Immediately Nathanael said, &#8220;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&#8221; (John 1:45-46). Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He, the seed of David, had not been born in Nazareth but in Bethlehem. Because the Lord was raised in Nazareth, others did not consider Him as one born in Bethlehem. The Lord thus appeared as a Nazarene from Galilee (John 7:52), a town that was despised by the people at that time. As a despised Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was low in rank and position.<p>We need to experience Christ as a Nazarene, as the One rejected by the world and despised by men. If we experience Christ as such a One and walk in the way of the kingdom, we too will be rejected by the world and despised by others.<h2 class=head3>7. The Baptizer</h2><h2 class=head4>a. In the Spirit</h2><p>Christ is the Baptizer. Matthew 3:11b says, &#8220;He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire. The Lord&#8217;s baptism in the Holy Spirit began the kingdom of the heavens, bringing His believers into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire will terminate the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s baptism in the Holy Spirit, based on His redemption, is the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire, based on His judgment, is its ending.<p>Another verse that speaks of Christ as the Baptizer is John 1:33. In this verse John the Baptist says, &#8220;He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Water signifies death and burial for the termination of the repenting people; the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated people. The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ baptized those who believed in Him, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized into the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13), which is joined to the Lord in one spirit (6:17).<h2 class=head4>b. To Put Us into the Triune God</h2><p>As the Baptizer, Christ puts us into the Triune God. For this reason Matthew 28:19 speaks of the believers being baptized &#8220;into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Such a baptism is both essential and economical. The Lord Jesus is the One who is able to put us into the Triune God that we may have a new beginning, become a new being, and enter into a new sphere-the sphere of the Body.<h2 class=head4>c. To Make Us Grains of Wheat and Gather Us into His Barn</h2><p>Christ is the Baptizer to make us grains of wheat and then to gather us into His barn (Matt. 13:30b, 43). Matthew 3:12 says, &#8220;He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.&#8221; Those typified by wheat have life within. The Lord Jesus will baptize them in the Holy Spirit and gather them into His barn in heaven by rapture. Those typified by the chaff are without life. The Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire.<h2 class=head3>8. God the Father&#8217;s Beloved Son</h2><p>For our experience and enjoyment, Christ is also God the Father&#8217;s beloved Son. Matthew 3:17 says, &#8220;Behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.&#8221; This was the speaking of the Father as a testimony to the Lord Jesus as the Father&#8217;s beloved Son. Matthew 17:5 says, &#8220;Behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!&#8221; This declaration of the Father to vindicate the Son was first given in 3:17 after Christ&#8217;s rising from baptism, which signified His resurrection from the dead. Later, in 17:5, the Father declared the same thing, this time to vindicate the Son in His transfiguration, which prefigures the coming kingdom. In each instance we see that Christ is the beloved Son of the Father, the Son of His love (Col. 1:13).<h2 class=head4>a. The Embodiment and Expression of the Triune God</h2><p>As God the Father&#8217;s beloved Son, Christ is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. &#8220;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&#8221; (Col. 2:9). The words the fullness of the Godhead refer to the entire Godhead, to the complete God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Because the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it would not be correct to say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit. Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Therefore, as the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.<p>The Son is God Himself expressed (Heb. 1:8). God the Father is hidden; God the Son is expressed. No one has ever seen God; the Son, as the Word of God (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13) and the speaking of God (Heb. 1:1-2), has declared Him in a full expression, explanation, and definition (John 1:18).<p>In His human living and in His work, Christ the Son expressed the Father (John 14:9). The Son came in the Father&#8217;s name (5:43), worked in the Father&#8217;s name (10:25), did the Father&#8217;s will (6:38), spoke the Father&#8217;s word (3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:47-50), and sought the Father&#8217;s glory (7:18). He was one with the Father (10:30). He had no work, no will, no word, no glory, and no ambition for Himself. As such a one, Christ expressed only the Father. He did not express Himself. He was the Son, yet He expressed the Father.<p>Whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit. According to the writings of Paul, to have the Son is to have both the Father and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God realized as the Spirit for our experience and enjoyment. Through incarnation, the Son of God became a man who was the last Adam, who through death and resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor.15:45b). &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). Therefore, the Son of God, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, became a man and in resurrection this One is now the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Participate in the Fullness of the Godhead to Become God&#8217;s Expression</h2><p>As God the Father&#8217;s beloved Son, Christ is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God for us to participate in the fullness of the Godhead to become God&#8217;s expression. John 1:16 says, &#8220;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&#8221; This indicates that in the beloved Son we participate in the fullness of the Godhead. This fullness is unlimited. The more we experience and enjoy this fullness, the more we realize that it is unlimited. As we participate in the fullness of the Godhead, we become the fullness of the Triune God, which is the expression of the processed Triune God.<p>Paul refers to this in Ephesians 3:19, where he speaks of the believers being &#8220;filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; The fullness of God is the expression of God. According to John 1:16, the fullness of God came with Christ, who is the embodiment of God&#8217;s fullness (Col. 2:9; 1:19). With Christ, the expression was an individual matter. This expression, therefore, needed to be enlarged, to be expanded from an individual matter to a corporate matter. The church today is to be the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God in a corporate way. In the church the Triune God is not expressed through an individual; He is expressed corporately through the Body. As we participate in the fullness of the Godhead embodied in the Son, we become the corporate fullness, the corporate expression, of the Triune God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h2 class=head3>9. A Man-the Son of Man</h2><p>We may experience and enjoy Christ not only as God but also as a man-the Son of Man (Matt. 4:4; 19:28; 26:64; 24:37, 39, 44). However, not many Christians have a particular and fine experience of Christ as a man. It seems that it is easier for us to experience Christ as God than as a man.<h2 class=head4>a. In His Humanity</h2><p>In His humanity Christ is the Son of Man. Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He is the Son of God. Because He was born of a human virgin, He is the Son of Man. On the divine side, He is the Son of God; on the human side, He is the Son of Man. To accomplish God&#8217;s purpose, it was necessary for Christ to become a man. Without man, God&#8217;s purpose cannot be carried out on earth.<p>In Matthew 4:3 the Lord Jesus was tempted by the devil with respect to His humanity. &#8220;The tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread.&#8221; For forty days Christ had fasted in His humanity, standing on the ground of His being a man. For Him to accomplish His ministry for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose, He had to defeat the enemy, the devil, Satan. This He had to do as a man. Hence, He stood as a man to confront the enemy of God. The devil, knowing this, tempted Him to leave the standing as a man and assume His position as the Son of God. If He had assumed this position before the enemy, He would have lost the standing to defeat him. For this reason, the Lord Jesus &#8220;answered and said, It is written, &#8216;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8217;&#8221; (v. 4). The devil tempted the Lord Jesus to take His position as the Son of God, but He answered him with the word of the Scriptures, &#8220;Man,&#8221; indicating that He stood in the position of man to deal with the enemy.<p>The Lord Jesus faced a similar temptation when He was judged by the Sanhedrin. &#8220;The high priest said to Him, I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus said to him, You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&#8221; (Matt. 26:63-64). The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with &#8220;the Son of Man,&#8221; the same way He had answered the devil. This indicates that the Lord was the Son of Man on earth before His crucifixion, that He has been the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God since His resurrection (Acts 7:56), and that He will be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds (Matt. 24:30).<p>Furthermore, Christ as the Son of Man came in His humanity to seek and save the lost sinners (Matt. 18:11; 9:13; Luke 19:10). He ate and drank with the tax collectors and sinners (Matt. 9:10-11; 11:19; Luke 7:34), making friends with them. He visited and lodged with a sinful man, a tax collector named Zaccheus (Luke 19:5-7). As the Son of Man, Christ came not to destroy men&#8217;s lives but to save them (Luke 9:56). As the Son of Man, Christ had no place to lay His head (Matt. 8:20; Luke 9:58), not even as the foxes having holes nor as the birds of heaven having roosts. By enjoying Christ as the Son of Man, we have to learn to suffer poverty in this way.<p>The Lord as the Son of Man also sowed Himself, in His humanity, as the good seed into man to grow Him (Matt. 13:3-9, 37). Christ came in His humanity, not to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45). Christ gave, in His humanity, the food which abides unto eternal life (John 6:27, 53). As the Son of Man, Christ was delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and was crucified by them (Matt. 17:22-23a; 20:18-19a; 26:2). His being lifted up on the cross as the Son of Man was so that people may know that He is the great I Am (John 8:28) and that He may draw all men to Himself (12:32, 34). Christ as the Son of Man was buried in His humanity in the heart of the earth three days and three nights as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish (Matt. 12:40; Luke 11:30). As the Son of Man, Christ resurrected in His humanity on the third day after His burial  (Matt. 17:23b; 20:19b), being glorified with the Father&#8217;s glory (John 12:23; 13:31-32; 7:39; Luke 24:26). As such a Son of Man, Christ accomplishes God&#8217;s purpose. Hence, we need to experience and enjoy Christ as the Son of Man.<h2 class=head4>b. With All the Virtues of Humanity</h2><p>As the Son of Man, Christ has all the virtues of humanity (Psa. 45:2a). The Lord Jesus possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. In Him we see all the attributes of God and all the human virtues, for His constitution is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. Moreover, in Christ the divine attributes strengthen and enrich the human virtues. With Him the divine attributes fill the human virtues, and the human virtues contain the divine attributes. The divine attribute is the inward reality, and the human virtue is the outward appearance. Therefore, the virtues of the man Jesus are filled, mingled, and saturated with the attributes of God.<p>As the Son of Man, Christ expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues. God is bountiful in His rich and many attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness. God&#8217;s attributes were lived out of the man Jesus, and all of God&#8217;s attributes became the virtues of the man Jesus. No one can deny that the human virtues of Christ were aromatic; even when non-Christians read the four Gospels, they sense that the Jesus recorded in these books was a sweet and fragrant One whose virtues were aromatic. Through His aromatic human virtues, Christ attracted and captivated people. For instance, the record in Matthew 4 shows us that when the Lord Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Peter, John, and James, who were either fishing or mending nets with their father. Then He called them, saying, &#8220;Come after Me.&#8221; Immediately they followed Him, giving up their net mending, abandoning their boat, and forsaking their father (vv. 18-22). This indicates that the Lord must have displayed an aromatic power in His countenance and His voice which could really attract and captivate people and that the Lord Jesus must have had an indescribable sweetness and aroma emanating from Him in His humanity. This is why so many people throughout the centuries have been captivated by Christ and love Him. Such a Christ now lives in us, and we need to experience and enjoy Him as the Son of Man with all the virtues of humanity.<h2 class=head3>10. The Great Light</h2><p>Matthew 4:16 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the great light springing up to those sitting in the region and shadow of death and shining over the people sitting in darkness. This verse says, &#8220;The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.&#8221; This light is actually Christ Himself as the light of life (John 8:12) shining in the shadow of death. In Matthew 4:16 the Lord Jesus made no display of power or authority. Rather, He walked on the seashore as a common person. But when He contacted people by the Sea of Galilee, He shined upon them like a great light shining in the darkness and in the region and shadow of death.<h2 class=head4>a. Springing Up to Those Sitting in the Region and Shadow of Death</h2><p>Wherever Christ comes, light comes also. As a great light, He springs up to those who are sitting in the region and shadow of death. This region is not only a region but also a shadow. The entire region is a shadow of death. Before we were saved, we all were in that region, a region full of the shadow of death.<h2 class=head4>b. Shining Over the People Sitting in Darkness</h2><p>Those who sit in the region and shadow of death also sit in darkness. The shadow of death is darkness, the darkness of Satan. To those sitting in such a darkness, Christ comes not only as light but as the great light.<p>Many of us can testify of having experienced Christ as the great light shining upon us and within us. When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine light came into our being. Immediately we had the sense of something shining within. This kind of shining is the shining of Christ as light. The shining of Christ as light within us is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God to be His children.<h2 class=head3>11. The Healer</h2><p>In Matthew 4:23-24, we see that Christ is also the Healer. Whereas the shining of light annuls darkness, healing annuls death. All diseases, all sicknesses, lead to death. Therefore, to be healed is to be rescued from death. We may also say that Christ&#8217;s healing swallows up the death element in our being.<h2 class=head4>a. Healing Our Diseases and Sicknesses</h2><p>As the Healer, Christ heals our diseases and sicknesses. &#8220;Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. And the report concerning Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those afflicted with various diseases and torments and those possessed by demons and epileptics and paralytics; and He healed them&#8221; (Matt. 4:23-24). Here disease and sickness are two different words in Greek. The Greek word translated disease and diseases refers to an incurable illness. The Greek word rendered sickness refers to light illnesses. According to these verses, Christ is the Healer of both diseases and sicknesses.<p>Matthew 9:35 says, &#8220;Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.&#8221; Here &#8220;every disease and every sickness&#8221; signifies spiritual illness.<h2 class=head4>b. Taking Our Infirmities</h2><p>As our Healer, the Lord Jesus also takes our infirmities. &#8220;When evening fell, they brought to Him many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all those who were ill He healed, so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, &#8216;He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases&#8217;&#8221; (8:16-17). All healings accomplished on fallen people are due to the Lord&#8217;s redemption. He took our infirmities and bore our diseases on His cross and accomplished full healing for us there. We may experience Christ as the Healer who takes away our infirmities, our weaknesses. However, the application of healing by divine power can only be a foretaste in this age; the full taste will be accomplished in the coming age.<h2 class=head4>c. Casting Out Demons</h2><p>As the Healer, Christ also casts out demons. Demons are not fallen angels but spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan&#8217;s rebellion (see Life-study of Genesis, Message 2). The fallen angels work with Satan in the air (Eph. 2:2; 6:11-12), and the demons move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon people for the kingdom of Satan. The demons&#8217; possession of people signifies Satan&#8217;s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. Therefore, in His ministry on earth the Lord Jesus cast out demons from possessed people that they might be delivered from Satan&#8217;s bondage (Luke 13:16), out of Satan&#8217;s authority of darkness (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13) into God&#8217;s kingdom.<h2 class=head3>12. The Great Teacher</h2><p>Christ is all-inclusive. As the great light, He enlightens us; as the Healer, He heals us; and as the great Teacher, He teaches us.<p>Man&#8217;s fall into sin broke His fellowship with God. As a result, man became ignorant of the knowledge of God. Such ignorance issued first in darkness and then in death. Christ, as the light of the world (John 8:12; 9:5), came to Galilee, the land of darkness, and He came as a great light to shine upon the people in darkness. His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life (1:4). His teaching was thus the shining of a great light. Every word that issued out of His mouth was an enlightening word. Therefore, while He was teaching the people, the light was shining upon them. In this way the people sitting in darkness were enlightened by the Lord&#8217;s teaching and were brought out of satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18).<h2 class=head4>a. As One Having Authority</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He taught as One having authority (Matt. 7:28-29). Mark 1:22 says, &#8220;They were astounded at His teaching, for He taught them as One having authority and not like the scribes.&#8221; The self-appointed scribes, teaching vain knowledge by themselves, had no authority and no power. But the Lord Jesus, as the God-authorized Teacher, teaching realities by God, had not only spiritual power to subdue people but also divine authority to subject them to the divine ruling.<h2 class=head4>b. Teaching Things of Life concerning the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>As the great Teacher authorized by God, the Lord Jesus taught the things of life concerning the kingdom of the heavens. In Matthew 7:14 He said, &#8220;Narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.&#8221; Here life refers to the ever-blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God. This life is in the reality of the kingdom today and will be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age (19:29; Luke 18:30).<p>In Matthew 7:21 the Lord speaks a word concerning the kingdom of the heavens. &#8220;Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&#8221; To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (Rom. 10:13), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens also requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God by being regenerated (John 3:3, 5). This latter is by the birth of the divine life; the former is by the living of that life.<h2 class=head3>13. The One Who Has Authority</h2><p>In Matthew 8:8-10 and 13 we see that the Lord Jesus is the One who has authority. The Gentile centurion said to Him, &#8220;I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it&#8221; (v. 9). This indicates that the centurion recognized the authority of the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head4>a. Exercised in His Word</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s authority is exercised mainly in His word. When the Lord told the centurion that He would come and heal his servant, the centurion said to Him, &#8220;Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed&#8221; (v. 8). The Gentile centurion realized that the Lord&#8217;s word was with healing authority. Thus, he believed, not only in the Lord but also in His word, asking Him not to go personally but only to send His word.<h2 class=head4>b. Through Faith Infused into Us by Him</h2><p>On the one hand, regarding the Lord, His authority is exercised in His word. On the other hand, regarding us, the Lord&#8217;s authority is exercised through faith infused into us by Him. When we see the Lord and listen to Him, His being, His very character, infuses into us the ability to believe. This believing ability is something that comes from Him. As we behold the Lord in His beauty and in the excellency of His virtues, He infuses a living element into us, and this infused element becomes our faith, our believing ability. This is why the Lord Jesus is called the Author and Perfecter of faith (Heb. 12:2). The centurion had such faith infused into him by the Lord Jesus. The Lord marveled at the centurion&#8217;s faith, saying, &#8220;Truly I say to you, With no one in Israel have I found such great faith&#8221; (Matt. 8:10). Then He said to the centurion, &#8220;Go. As you have believed, so be it done to you&#8221; (v. 13).<h2 class=head3>14. The One Ruling Over the Winds and the Sea</h2><p>In Matthew 8:23-27 the Lord Jesus is revealed as the One ruling over the winds and the sea. This is not an ordinary authority; on the contrary, it must be counted as an extraordinary authority.<p>As we follow the Lord, we will often find ourselves on a stormy sea. During the storm we need to turn to Him as the One who rules over the winds and the sea. We need to experience and enjoy Christ as such a One.<h2 class=head4>a. Through His Word</h2><p>The Lord Jesus rules over the winds and the sea through His word. &#8220;He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&#8221; (vv. 26b-27). The Lord Jesus rebuked the winds and the sea because in the winds were the fallen angels of Satan (Eph. 6:12), and in the sea were the demons (Matt. 8:32). Therefore, actually it was not the winds and the sea but the fallen angels above the winds and the demons under the sea that obeyed the Lord&#8217;s word of authority.<h2 class=head4>b. Training Us in Faith</h2><p>As the One who rules over the winds and the sea, the Lord Jesus trains us in faith. In Matthew 8:26a He said to the disciples, &#8220;Why are you cowardly, you of little faith?&#8221; Faith comes from and depends upon the word of the Lord (Rom. 10:17). In Matthew 8:18 the Lord had given the disciples the word &#8220;to depart to the other side.&#8221; If they had believed that word, they would not have needed to pray as they did in verse 25: &#8220;Lord, save us; we are perishing!&#8221; Their realization of the Lord&#8217;s word was not in full; thus, their faith was &#8220;little.&#8221;<p>We today need to believe in the Lord Jesus as the King, as the divine Administrator of the entire universe. He rules over all things. May we all learn to experience and enjoy Christ as such a One.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=title>(4)</h1><p>In this message we will cover further aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew. All these aspects are related to experiencing and enjoying Christ as the most pleasant person.<h2 class=head3>15. The Forgiver of Sins</h2><p>In Matthew 9:1-8 we see that Christ is the Forgiver of sins. &#8220;Behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven&#8221; (v. 2). This word was probably a shock to the paralytic and to those who had brought him to the Lord. They no doubt had never thought that the cause of his illness was sin. But much to their surprise, the Lord Jesus told the paralytic that his sins were forgiven.<p>As fallen human beings, our basic problem is our sin, even our sins. All the problems of mankind are the result of sin. Because of sin, the situation of fallen mankind is hopeless. Because of sin, everyone has been corrupted. Because all the problems of mankind are the result of sin, sin must be dealt with if people are to be restored to God. We need Christ as the Forgiver of sins. On the day we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, our sins were forgiven.<h2 class=head4>a. As the Son of Man</h2><p>Matthew 9:6a indicates that it is as the Son of Man that the Lord Jesus is the Forgiver of our sins. The One who forgave the sins of the paralytic was actually the forgiving God in the form of a lowly man. He was the incarnation of the forgiving God. When the Lord Jesus forgave the sins of the paralytic, His deity was manifested in His humanity.<h2 class=head4>b. Having the Authority to Forgive Sins</h2><p>Verse 6 reveals that &#8220;the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.&#8221; To forgive sins is a matter of authority on earth. Only the Lord Jesus, who had been authorized by God and who would die to redeem sinners, has such authority (Acts 5:31; 10:43; 13:38). Because the Lord Jesus is the God-man, He has not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins.<h2 class=head3>16. The Physician</h2><p>Matthew 9:10-13 indicates that we also may experience and enjoy Christ as the Physician. In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the Lord Jesus ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge. A judge&#8217;s judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician&#8217;s healing is according to mercy and grace. If the Lord Jesus had visited us as a Judge, we all would have been condemned and rejected. None of us would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of the heavenly kingdom. However, He came to minister as a Physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save us, that we might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens, with whom He is establishing His heavenly kingdom on this corrupted earth.<h2 class=head4>a. Healing Man&#8217;s Spiritual Illness, the Illness of Sin</h2><p>&#8220;But go and learn what this means, &#8216;I desire mercy and not sacrifice,&#8217; for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners&#8221; (v. 13). The Lord&#8217;s word here, addressed to the Pharisees, indicates that the Lord Jesus heals man&#8217;s spiritual illness, the illness of sin. Sin came first and death follows. Between sin and death there are all kinds of illnesses, diseases, and infirmities. The Lord Jesus forgives our sins and also heals us in every way. As sinners, we are sick absolutely, for we are sick physically, spiritually, morally, and mentally. But Jesus, the Forgiver and the Physician, is able to heal all our sicknesses.<p>As our Physician, the Lord heals us mainly in our spirit and in our soul, not mainly in our body. The tax collectors and sinners in Matthew 9:10 were not physically sick; they were spiritually sick. While the Lord Jesus was feasting with them, He was healing them spiritually. Likewise, although the Lord may or may not heal us in our body, He is always ready to heal us in every part of our spirit and soul.<h2 class=head4>b. Not for the Righteous but for Sinners</h2><p>As the Physician, the Lord Jesus is not for the righteous but for sinners. The Lord &#8220;did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&#8221; There is none righteous, not even one (Rom. 3:10). All &#8220;the righteous&#8221; are self-righteous like the Pharisees (Luke 18:9). The Lord came to call not them but sinners.<p>The Lord&#8217;s use of the word righteous in Matthew 9:13 is related to the matter of sins. This word also indicates that the healing of the Lord as our Physician is not mainly physical but spiritual. He is the One who heals our spiritual sicknesses.<h2 class=head3>17. The Bridegroom</h2><p>In Matthew 9:14 the disciples of John asked the Lord Jesus, &#8220;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&#8221; In His answer, the Lord revealed Himself as the Bridegroom. &#8220;Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast&#8221; (v. 15). Matthew 25:1 is a further word concerning the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom. This verse reveals that the Lord will come back as the Bridegroom, as the pleasant and attractive person.<h2 class=head4>a. The Pleasant Person</h2><p>The Bible reveals that Christ is God embodied to have the bride. Therefore, Christ&#8217;s status is that of the Bridegroom. As the Bridegroom, He is the pleasant person for our enjoyment. When He is present, there is no need of fasting. When He is present, there should not be any sadness. Instead, everything should be pleasant.<p>In dealing with the self-righteous Pharisees, the Lord indicated that He is the Physician to heal the sick. In dealing with the fasting disciples of John, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom coming for the bride. John the Baptist had indicated to his disciples that Christ is the Bridegroom (John 3:25-29), and in Matthew 9:15 the Lord Jesus reminded them of this. The Lord first healed His followers, then made them sons of the bridechamber. Eventually, He will make them His bride. Thus, they should appreciate Him not only as their Physician for the recovery of life but also as their Bridegroom for a living enjoyment in His presence. They were at a joyful wedding with Him, not at a sorrowful funeral without Him. How then could they fast and not feast before Him?<p>The question raised by John&#8217;s disciples seems to be one of doctrine. However, the Lord did not answer with a doctrine but with the revelation of Himself as the Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber.<h2 class=head4>b. For the Enjoyment of the Sons of the Bridechamber</h2><p>As the Bridegroom, Christ is for the enjoyment of the sons of the bridechamber. The phrase sons of the bridechamber refers to the disciples of the Lord. In the transitory period of the Lord&#8217;s ministry on earth, His disciples were sons of the bridechamber, those who are with the Bridegroom in His chamber, gazing on Him and enjoying His presence. Later they would become the bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7).<h2 class=head3>18. Unshrunk Cloth</h2><p>In Matthew 9:16 Christ refers to Himself as unshrunk, or unfulled, cloth. &#8220;No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.&#8221; The Greek word translated unfulled may also be translated &#8220;new,&#8221; &#8220;raw,&#8221; &#8220;unwrought.&#8221; The Greek word here is agnaphos, formed with a, which means &#8220;not,&#8221; and gnapto, which means &#8220;to card or comb wool&#8221;; hence, &#8220;to dress or full the cloth.&#8221; Thus, the word means &#8220;uncarded,&#8221; &#8220;unfulled,&#8221; &#8220;unfinished,&#8221; &#8220;unshrunk,&#8221; &#8220;untreated.&#8221; This unshrunk cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished, whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ after being &#8220;treated&#8221; in His crucifixion as a new robe. Christ was first the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and acceptable to Him (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30; Phil. 3:9).<h2 class=head4>a. Not for Patching an Old Garment</h2><p>Christ as the unshrunk cloth is not for patching an old garment. The old garment in Matthew 9:16 signifies man&#8217;s good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his old natural life. A patch of unshrunk cloth put on an old garment pulls away from the garment by its shrinking strength, thus making the tear worse. Putting a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment signifies trying to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth. Today some imitate Jesus&#8217; human deeds in the attempt to improve their behavior without believing in the crucified Jesus as their Redeemer and the resurrected Christ as their new garment to cover them as their righteousness before God.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in verse 16 indicates that we should never cut a piece of His unshrunk cloth and use it to mend the &#8220;holes&#8221; in our garments. His cloth is full of shrinking power, and when applied to old garments it will simply cause the holes in them to become larger. Christ is not for patching; He is for replacing. We cannot take Him in part; we must take Him as a whole. If we try to take a part of Christ for patching our old garments, the Lord will not agree. Christ does not intend to make perfect what is imperfect. Therefore, we must surrender to Him, put ourselves aside, and take Christ as a whole.<h2 class=head4>b. For Making a New Garment</h2><p>As unshrunk cloth, Christ was indeed wonderful but not adequate to cover us. Such cloth was new, but it was not in a suitable condition for us to wear. It required some work to be done on it, a work that was accomplished when Christ was on the cross. On the cross the Lord Jesus was treated; that is, He was dealt with by man and even more by God. Then in resurrection He became a new garment. Before His crucifixion He was unshrunk cloth, but after His resurrection He is the new garment for us to put on. This new garment is Christ as our righteousness to cover us outwardly.<p>The Christ we apply today is not Christ before His crucifixion. Rather, the Christ we apply is the One who has made Himself into a new garment through His death and resurrection. Now we may put Him on as a complete garment to cover our entire being. In this way Christ, the pleasant person as the new garment, replaces us with Himself.<h2 class=head3>19. New Wine</h2><p>In Matthew 9:17 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined.&#8221; The Greek word translated new in this verse is neos, which means &#8220;new in time,&#8221; &#8220;recent,&#8221; &#8220;young.&#8221; The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor and cheering strength, stirring us to excitement and satisfying us. When we receive His life, it works within us to stir us up, excite us, energize us, and make us happy. As the new wine, Christ is our content, the provision for our inward thirst.<p>Whereas the new garment is Christ as our outward covering, the new wine is Christ as our inward cheering. As we contact the Lord, we should take Him not only as the new garment to cover us but also as the new wine to cheer us and to stir us up. The more we contact the Lord, the more He, the new wine, will make us cheerful. He surely is a most pleasant person!<h2 class=head4>a. Not to Be Put into Old Wineskins</h2><p>In verse 17 the Lord Jesus says that we should not put new wine into old wineskins. Old wineskins signify religious forms, rituals, and practices. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins will burst the wineskins by its fermenting power. To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion. We should never try to put the wine of Christ&#8217;s life into the wineskin of old religious practices, for the wine will burst those practices. The new wine of Christ as life requires a new wineskin.<h2 class=head4>b. To Be Put into Fresh Wineskins</h2><p>New wine is to be put into fresh wineskins. According to the Lord&#8217;s word in verse 17, if we put new wine into fresh wineskins, &#8220;both are preserved.&#8221; The Greek word rendered fresh here is kainos, which means &#8220;new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused&#8221;; hence, &#8220;fresh.&#8221; The fresh wineskins signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life. The believers are built into the church, and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live. The believers are regenerated persons constituting the Body of Christ to be the church (Rom. 12:5; Eph. 1:22-23). This Body of Christ as His fullness is also called &#8220;the Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:12), the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the new wine, the exciting life inwardly, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin, the container to hold the new wine outwardly. We need to experience and enjoy Christ as the Forgiver, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new garment, and the new wine that we may be the fresh wineskin to contain Him.<p>The new wineskin is actually the church life. The church is the enlargement of Christ. The individual Christ is the wine within us. When this individual Christ is enlarged into a corporate Christ, that is the church. This corporate Christ is the wineskin, the container, to contain the individual Christ as our wine.<p>Christ is not only the new garment and the new wine, but, being increased, He is also our new wineskin to contain the wine. He is our outward qualification, He is our inward satisfaction, and in a corporate way He is the church, the Body, which is capable of holding the wine. From this we see that Christ is everything for our experience and enjoyment. He is the Forgiver, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the new wineskin, the corporate vessel to contain and express what we enjoy of Him.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><h2 class=head3>20. The One with Heavenly-ruled Deeds- the Fringe of His Garment</h2><p>In Matthew 9:20-22 Christ is revealed as the One with heavenly-ruled deeds-the fringe of His garment. Verses 20 and 21 say, &#8220;Behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment, for she said within herself, If only I touch His garment, I will be healed.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus turned and saw her, He said, &#8220;Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you&#8221; (v. 22a).<h2 class=head4>a. In His Human Virtues</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s garment signifies Christ&#8217;s righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling. According to Numbers 15:38-40, Israelite males had to wear a blue fringe on their garments, a ribbon in the color of blue. (Blue signifies heavenliness.) This meant that their lives, their walk, were restricted by a heavenly limitation. They were ruled, governed, and restricted by heavenly regulations. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He probably dressed in this way. Garments signify virtue in human behavior. The Lord&#8217;s garments signify His perfect behavior in His humanity, His human virtuous perfection. In the human virtue of the Lord Jesus there was healing power. Therefore, when the sick woman touched the fringe of His garment, the power of His virtue went out to her, and she was healed. Out of Christ&#8217;s heavenly-ruled deeds comes the virtue that becomes the healing power (Matt. 14:36).<p>To touch the fringe of the Lord&#8217;s garment was to touch the Lord Himself in His humanity, in whom God was embodied (Col. 2:9). By such a touch His divine power was transfused into the touching one through the perfection of His humanity and became her healing. God, who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), became touchable in Christ through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment.<p>As a pleasant person, Christ is not only the Forgiver, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and the new wine; He is also the One with healing power in the beauty of His human virtues. We who believe in Him, love Him, and read His word have been healed by His human virtue. The more we contact Him in prayer, the more we are healed. This healing is a matter of transformation. As we see Christ in His heavenly-ruled deeds and activities and contact Him, we are healed, transformed. This is our experience when we touch the fringe of the Lord&#8217;s garment. This fringe is the totality of all the Lord&#8217;s human virtues, and this totality issues in healing power. In this healing power there is a transforming element that changes our character.<h2 class=head4>b. Through Faith Infused into Us by His Attractiveness</h2><p>The woman in Matthew 9:20-22 and the centurion in 8:5-10 both came to contact the Lord Jesus in the same way-with faith. This woman was healed through faith. Today the faith through which we are healed is the faith that is infused into us by Christ&#8217;s attractiveness. As we behold Him in His attractiveness, faith is infused into us.<h2 class=head3>21. The Shepherd</h2><p>&#8220;Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd&#8221; (Matt. 9:36). Here we see that the Lord Jesus considered the people as sheep and Himself as the Shepherd. When Christ came to the Jews the first time, they were like lepers, paralytics, demon possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons, because they had no shepherd to care for them. Therefore, He ministered to them not only as a Physician but also as a Shepherd, as prophesied in Isaiah 53:6 and 40:11. As such a Shepherd, the Lord Jesus did miracles to take care of the needy ones. He said, &#8220;The blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them&#8221; (Matt. 11:5). This is the compassion exercised by the Lord as their Shepherd to take care of them. As a minister of the Lord, we should learn how to be concerned for the needy ones.<h2 class=head4>a. Of the Sheep Harassed and Cast Away</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is the Shepherd of the sheep that were &#8220;harassed and cast away.&#8221; They were in difficulties and were constantly suffering. They were cast away and were wandering, not knowing where to go. To such ones Christ came as the Shepherd. As the Shepherd, the Lord is not rough but is very fine.<h2 class=head4>b. With Compassion</h2><p>Matthew 9:36 tells us that when the Lord Jesus saw the crowds, He was &#8220;moved with compassion.&#8221; Compassion is deeper, finer, and richer than mercy. Mercy is somewhat outward, but compassion is inward. Furthermore, compassion is  longer lasting than mercy. Compassion, therefore, is both deeper and longer lasting than mercy.<h2 class=head3>22. Wisdom</h2><p>Matthew 11:19b indicates that Christ is wisdom. &#8220;Wisdom is justified by her works.&#8221; Wisdom is Christ (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Christ Himself. This wisdom was justified, vindicated, by His wise works, His wise deeds.<h2 class=head4>a. The Wisdom from God to Us</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ has become &#8220;wisdom to us from God.&#8221; For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is a transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience. Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God. Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience. If we are one with the Lord to receive His dispensing, He will be transmitted into us as wisdom. Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. If we do this, we will enjoy Christ and have Him as our wisdom. This is Christ as the wisdom from God to us.<h2 class=head4>b. Justified by the Children of Wisdom</h2><p>In Luke 7:35 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Wisdom is justified by all her children.&#8221; Those who believe in Christ are the children of wisdom, those who justify Christ and His deeds and who follow Him as their wisdom.<p>Matthew 11:19b says that wisdom is justified by her works, and Luke 7:35 says that wisdom is justified by her children. We are the children of wisdom. Christ&#8217;s work is to produce us as the children of wisdom.<h2 class=head3>23. Rest</h2><p>Matthew 11:28 and 29 reveal that Christ is rest. If we take Christ as our wisdom, we may become very busy. For this reason, taking Christ as our wisdom needs to be balanced by taking Him as our rest.<h2 class=head4>a. Rest from Being Burdened to Labor</h2><p>&#8220;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest&#8221; (v. 28). Here the Lord Jesus sounds out a call to come to Him for rest from being burdened to toil. The toil mentioned in this verse refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened. Thus, the Lord calls the toiling ones to come to Him for rest. Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law and religion or under any work and responsibility but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.<h2 class=head4>b. Rest in Taking His Yoke and Learning of Him</h2><p>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus gives us the way to rest: &#8220;Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s yoke, His way of living, is a rest, but our yoke is a burden. Therefore, we should not take our yoke. Rather, we should take the Lord&#8217;s yoke, His way of living.<p>The Lord&#8217;s yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord Jesus lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father&#8217;s will (Matt. 26:39, 42). Therefore, He asks us to learn from Him. To learn from Him is not to imitate Him outwardly but to copy the Lord in our spirit by taking His yoke-God&#8217;s will (11:29a; 1 Pet. 2:21). God&#8217;s will has to yoke us, and we have to put our neck into this yoke.<p>The Lord Jesus said that if we take His yoke and learn from Him, we will find rest for our souls. The rest we find by taking the Lord&#8217;s yoke and learning from Him is for our souls. It is an inward rest, not anything merely outward in nature. The hardest thing is to rest in our souls. People lose sleep because their soul is bothered. Yet by taking the Lord&#8217;s yoke and learning from Him, we share in our soul His rest in satisfaction (Matt. 11:28b, 29b, 30).<h2 class=head3>24. The One Greater than the Temple</h2><p>Christ is the One greater than the temple (Matt. 12:6). In the Old Testament the temple was the house of God (1 Kings 6:1). The temple was founded upon a foundation of stone (5:17; 6:37), and it was built of stone, cedar, and cypress overlaid with gold (vv. 7, 9, 15-16, 18, 20-22). Stone signifies transformed humanity; cedar, humanity in resurrection; cypress, humanity through death; and gold, divinity. Therefore, with the temple we see the mingling of humanity with divinity through death and in resurrection and transformation. The temple built of these materials was a type of Christ as the real temple, as the One greater than the temple.<p>In Matthew 12:6 the Lord Jesus declared, &#8220;I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.&#8221; This word was spoken in reference to the historical instance mentioned in verses 3 and 4. David and his followers were not priests, but they entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence. They were justified in doing this because they were in the house of God. This instance illustrates an important principle: outside the temple everything was common, but when something was brought into the temple, it was sanctified by the temple. Everything, every day, every matter, and everyone in the temple was holy. The principle is the same with Christ as the One who is greater than the temple. Whatever we do outside of Christ is illegal, but whatever we do in Christ is legal.<h2 class=head4>a. For Feeding His Followers</h2><p>Christ is the One greater than the temple for feeding His followers. When the Pharisees criticized the Lord&#8217;s disciples for picking ears of grain on the Sabbath, He said, &#8220;Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?&#8221; (vv. 3-4). Just as David and his followers were hungry, so Christ and His disciples were hungry. The context, therefore, clearly indicates that Christ is the real temple, the One greater than the temple, for the feeding of those who follow Him.<h2 class=head4>b. With Himself as the Holy Food- the Bread of the Presence</h2><p>As the One greater than the temple, Christ feeds us with Himself as the holy food-the bread of the Presence (v. 4). The bread of the Presence in verse 4 refers to the holy food, the bread on the table in the temple. The bread of the Presence signifies Christ as our life supply (John 6:35, 57). In a more particular way, it signifies Christ as the food for God&#8217;s priests, since only priests were qualified to be in the Holy Place. Today all believers in Christ are priests, and in Him as the real temple we may enjoy Him as the holy food.<p>On the table of the bread of the Presence twelve loaves of bread were displayed. The number twelve signifies eternal completion and perfection. Christ is our eternal bread, and our enjoyment of Him as the bread of Presence, the holy food, is eternal.<h2 class=head3>25. The Lord of the Sabbath</h2><p>To the children of Israel the temple was a great thing, and the Sabbath was a great matter. But One came on the scene who was so great that He could declare that He was greater than the temple and assert that He was Lord of the Sabbath. He boldly said to the Pharisees, &#8220;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (Matt. 12:8).<p>In Matthew 12:6 there is a type-fulfilling change from the temple to the person of the Lord Jesus. Now in verse 8 there is a right-asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath. As the Lord of the Sabbath, Christ had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself. He was above all rituals and regulations, and since He was present, no attention should have been paid to such things.<h2 class=head4>a. In His Humanity-the Son of Man</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word, &#8220;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,&#8221; indicates His deity in His humanity. He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath. It is in His humanity that Christ, the Son of Man, is Lord of the Sabbath.<h2 class=head4>b. In Him the Keeping of the Sabbath Being Annulled</h2><p>Since the Lord is the Lord of the Sabbath, He has the full right to annul it, just as He had the full right to ordain it. Furthermore, the Lord Himself is the rest, the Sabbath, to us. Because we have Him as our rest and we are resting in Him all the time, the ritual of keeping the Sabbath is no longer needed. In Him and with His presence such a ritual is spontaneously annulled.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><h2 class=head3>26. The Servant of Jehovah</h2><p>In Matthew 12:18-21 we see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. Exodus 3 reveals that Christ is Jehovah Himself, but in these verses He is the Servant of Jehovah. As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ is the One sent by Jehovah to serve Jehovah&#8217;s purpose.<h2 class=head4>a. Chosen and Beloved of Jehovah, the One in Whom Jehovah Delights</h2><p>Matthew 12:18a says, &#8220;Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight.&#8221; Christ is the One chosen and beloved by Jehovah; He is the One in whom Jehovah delights.<h2 class=head4>b. With Jehovah&#8217;s Spirit upon Him, Announcing Justice to the Gentiles</h2><p>Matthew 12:18b goes on to say, &#8220;I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles.&#8221; As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ had Jehovah&#8217;s Spirit upon Him. When Christ was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and abode upon Him as the economical power for His ministry. With Jehovah&#8217;s Spirit upon Him, He announced justice to the nations. The word justice here means &#8220;righteousness&#8221; or &#8220;righteous judgment.&#8221; A righteous judgment is a decision for the right things. The Lord Jesus proclaimed all the right decisions for the Gentiles.<h2 class=head4>c. Not Striving nor Crying Out</h2><p>Matthew 12:19 says, &#8220;He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.&#8221; This means that the Lord did not shout or make noise. Instead of crying out to make His voice known in the streets, He was calm and quiet.<p>Verse 19 indicates that, as the Servant of Jehovah, Christ was no longer free to minister openly. On the contrary, because He had been rejected, He had to hide Himself. As the context of Matthew 12 makes clear, the reason for the rejection and the cause of the Lord&#8217;s hiding Himself was His breaking of the religious regulations. This was due to the Lord&#8217;s caring for His headship and for the members of His Body.<h2 class=head4>d. Not Breaking the Bruised Reed nor Quenching the Smoking Flax</h2><p>Matthew 12:20 continues, &#8220;A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory.&#8221; As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ will not break a bruised reed nor quench smoking flax. This indicates that while He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy. Those who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax, but the Lord Jesus was still merciful toward them.<p>The Jews used to make flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised, they broke it. They also made torches with flax to burn oil. When the oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord&#8217;s people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound. Others are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones nor quench the smoking ones. Although the Lord was rejected, He was still merciful. Even those who had become bruised reeds He would not break, and those who had become smoking flax He would not quench. Rather, He kept open to them the door of mercy and grace.<p>Among those who believe in the Lord Jesus today, many have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical sound. As a rule, the bruised reeds should be broken and thrown away. But Christ will not do this. Moreover, many of His believers no longer burn as a bright light. As a rule, He should quench them all and cast them away. But He will not do this either. Instead, as the merciful Servant of Jehovah, He would use some of those who are as bruised reeds and smoking flax to bring forth justice unto victory. If we think that no one is useful except ourselves, we cannot carry out the Lord&#8217;s work. The Lord would select some bruised reeds and smoking flax. He would perfect them so that they could become useful in His hand to bring forth justice unto victory. No matter how much He is opposed, He, the Servant of Jehovah, is still merciful.<h2 class=head4>e. The Gentiles Hoping in His Name</h2><p>&#8220;In His name will the Gentiles hope&#8221; (v. 21). Due to the rejection by the Jewish religionists, the Servant of Jehovah, with His salvation, turned to the Gentiles. Now the Gentiles put their hope in His name, believing in Him and receiving Him as their Savior.<p>The Gentiles have hope only in the name of the Lord Jesus. Apart from His name, there is no hope. The worldly people have no hope because they do not have the name of the Lord Jesus. But in His name we, the Gentiles, have our hope.<h2 class=head3>27. The One Greater than Jonah</h2><p>In Matthew 12:38-41 Christ is unveiled as the One greater than Jonah. When the scribes and Pharisees asked for a sign, the Lord Jesus said that no sign would be given &#8220;except the sign of Jonah the prophet&#8221; (v. 39). As a prophet, Jonah is a type of Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection.<h2 class=head4>a. As the Son of Man Resurrected from the Heart of the Earth after Being Buried Three Days and Three Nights</h2><p>&#8220;Just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights&#8221; (v. 40). The heart of the earth is called the lower parts of the earth (Eph. 4:9) and Hades (Acts 2:27), where the Lord went after His death. Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort (Luke 16:23-26). The section of comfort is Paradise, where the Lord went with the saved thief after they died (23:43). Hence, &#8220;heart of the earth,&#8221; &#8220;lower parts of the earth,&#8221; &#8220;Hades,&#8221; and &#8220;Paradise&#8221; are synonymous terms, referring to the one place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection. After those three days and three nights, He, as the Son of Man, was resurrected from the heart of the earth.<h2 class=head4>b. Preaching the Glad Tidings to the Gentiles</h2><p>As the One greater than Jonah, Christ preaches glad tidings to the nations. &#8220;Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here&#8221; (Matt. 12:41). Here we see that Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (Deut. 18:15, 18), is greater than Jonah the prophet. Jonah turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After he had remained there for three days and three nights, he came out to be a sign to that generation for repentance (Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10). This was a type of Christ, who would turn from Israel to the Gentiles and would be buried in the heart of the earth three days and three nights and then be resurrected, becoming a sign to this generation for salvation. As the One greater than Jonah, Christ in resurrection is the unique sign for today.<h2 class=head3>28. The One Greater than Solomon</h2><p>&#8220;The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here&#8221; (Matt. 12:42). Here we see that Christ, as the Son of David to be the King, is greater than Solomon the king. Solomon (1 Kings 6:1) typifies Christ as the One with wisdom to accomplish God&#8217;s eternal purpose, to build up God&#8217;s house, the temple, and to rule over God&#8217;s kingdom.<h2 class=head4>a. Speaking the Word of Wisdom</h2><p>Solomon spoke the word of wisdom (3:12, 28). As the One greater than Solomon, Christ speaks the word of wisdom today. Actually, the entire New Testament is a lengthy word of wisdom spoken by Christ as our Solomon.<h2 class=head4>b. Attracting People from the Gentiles</h2><p>In 1 Kings 10:1-8 a Gentile queen from Ethiopia, having heard of Solomon&#8217;s wisdom and having been attracted by it, came to him. This also is a picture of Christ. Today Christ as the One greater than Solomon is attracting to Himself people from the Gentiles.<h2 class=head3>29. The Sower</h2><p>The Gospel of Matthew begins with the Son of David (1:1) and ends with the Triune God (28:19). In between chapters one and twenty-eight we have the Sower (13:3). The Lord Jesus clearly considered Himself a Sower. In His ministry He apparently was a teacher and a preacher. Actually, in teaching the truth and in preaching the gospel, He was a Sower, and His life was a life of sowing. As the Sower, the Lord Jesus was the Distributor of the divine life.<h2 class=head4>a. Sowing Himself as the Seed of Life into Us</h2><p>The Sower is the wonderful person of the Lord Jesus, and the seed sown is also the Lord Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God. Christ has sown Himself as the seed of life into us (vv. 4a, 8). Christ is the seed signified by the word (v. 19), and we, the chosen ones of God, are the soil. In the sight of God, we are the soil for growing Christ. Therefore, Christ as the word is the seed of life sown into us as the soil.<p>Christ came to earth not only to be with us but also to be sown into our being. Through incarnation He became the seed of life, and in His ministry He sowed this seed into others. This means that He sowed Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God into His believers. As the Sower Christ has sown Himself as the seed of life into our hearts so that He may live in us, grow in us, and be expressed from within us.<p>Just as the seed of life is planted into the earth, is mingled with the element of the earth, and grows together with the earth to produce the plant, Christ has sown Himself as the seed of life into us as the earth and both He and we grow together. He as the life seed has a certain kind of element, and we as the growing earth also have a certain kind of element, and the two mingle together and grow together to be one plant. This is the Body of Christ constituted with the divine life mingled with humanity. The Body of Christ in reality is a plant growing out of Christ as the life seed into the human heart as the growing earth.<p>We need to see the vision of Christ, the Sower, sowing Himself as the seed of life into human beings. This vision is the very heart of the Lord&#8217;s recovery, for it is related to the desire of the Lord&#8217;s heart. Throughout more than sixty years, the Lord has been showing us what is on His heart: He desires to come into us, His chosen people, to be our life in the way of mingling in order to make Himself our element and to make us His expression. Christ, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, has sown Himself into our being. What a deep and profound matter this is!<h2 class=head4>b. Making Us the Wheat of Life</h2><p>By sowing Himself as the seed of life into us, Christ makes us the wheat of life (v. 30b). As the wheat of life we are the many grains produced by Christ (John 12:24). The Triune God in His embodiment has been sown into our being to grow wheat, producing the many grains that can be blended together to be one entity, the one Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). This thought is high, deep, and profound.<h2 class=head3>30. The Feeder</h2><p>Following the Sower we have the Feeder (Matt. 14:16-21; 15:33-38). Christ has sown Himself into us, and now He is feeding us so that we may grow Him in our being.<h2 class=head4>a. With Himself as the Barley Loaves and Fish</h2><p>As the Feeder, Christ feeds us with Himself as the barley loaves and fish (John 6:9). Whereas the loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ&#8217;s life, the fish are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ&#8217;s life. To satisfy our spiritual hunger, we need both Christ&#8217;s generating life and His redeeming life.<p>As the generating life, Christ grows on the land, the God-created earth. In order to regenerate us, He grew on the God-created earth for reproducing.<p>Barley signifies Christ resurrected. According to the Scriptures, barley represents the firstfruits of resurrection. In Leviticus 23 the Lord&#8217;s people were told to offer the firstfruits of their harvest each year. In the land of Palestine, barley ripens earlier than any other crop and is the first of the harvest. Hence, it typifies the resurrected Christ (v. 10). Barley thus signifies the resurrected Christ, who is our life supply. As the firstfruits, He has become our bread of life. From this we see that the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. The feeding Christ is the resurrected Christ.<p>The fish in John 6:9 are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ&#8217;s life. As the redeeming life, He lives in the sea, the Satan-corrupted world. The Lord Jesus came not only to the earth created by God but also to the world corrupted by Satan. If He had come only to the earth created by God, He would have been signified only by the barley loaves. But because He also came to the world corrupted by Satan, He is signified also by the fish.<p>Christ, however, had nothing to do with the corrupted world. Just as fish are not salty though they may live in salt water, so the Lord was not corrupted by Satan though He lived in the Satan-corrupted world. In order to redeem us, He lived in the satanic and sinful world. Nevertheless, He was sinless, unaffected by the world. As the generating life, Christ lived as a proper man in the God-created earth. As the redeeming life, Christ lived in the Satan-corrupted world without being affected by its corruption. We need the Lord Jesus to be both our generating life and our redeeming life. As members of Christ, we are now being fed by Christ with Himself as the resurrected bread of life, and we are being nourished by Him with His redeeming life.<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Receive Eternal Life</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s feeding us with Himself as the life supply is for us to receive eternal life. &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&#8221; (v. 54). This eternal life is the divine life, which is not only everlasting with respect to time but also eternal and divine in nature.<h2 class=head4>c. For Us to Live because of Him</h2><p>Through Christ&#8217;s feeding we receive eternal life, the divine life, that we may live daily by Him as our life supply. &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (v. 57b). Eating is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by Him whom we receive. Christ, therefore, is not only life but also the life supply, the food that sustains us to live because of Him in our daily walk.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><h2 class=head3>31. The Escort in the Way of Following Him</h2><p>In Matthew 14:22-33 Christ is presented to us as the Escort in the way of following Him. As the Escort, He protects us. Christ pioneers the way, and then He escorts us in the way, leading us on with much protection.<p>In 14:22-33 the disciples, while sailing on the sea, were &#8220;battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary&#8221; (v. 24). This indicates that there was a storm. This storm troubled the disciples, but it did not bother the Lord Jesus, who &#8220;came to them, walking on the sea&#8221; (v. 25).<p>We should not expect to follow the Lord Jesus in the way without facing any storms or contrary winds. To be sure, as we follow the Lord, we will experience storms. The more we are faithful to Him, the more storms we will have and the more contrary winds we will face. When a storm comes, we should learn to enjoy Christ as the Escort, as the One escorting us through the storm. Instead of worrying or doing things in ourselves, we should trust Him as the Pioneer and as the Escort. We all need to have much enjoyment of Christ in this matter.<h2 class=head4>a. Walking on the Stormy Sea</h2><p>Matthew 14:24 and 25 say, &#8220;The boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.&#8221; The Lord surely took notice that the boat was battered by the waves, and eventually He came to His disciples, walking on the sea. While the disciples were distressed by the waves, the Lord Jesus walked on them. This testifies that He is the Creator and the Ruler of the universe (Job 9:8).<h2 class=head4>b. Saving His Followers from the Storm</h2><p>As the Escort, Christ saved His followers from the storm. In response to the Lord&#8217;s word, Peter came &#8220;down from the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But seeing the strong wind, he became frightened; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!&#8221; (Matt. 14:29-30). Peter came down from the boat and walked on the waters by faith. However, when he saw the strong wind, his faith vanished. He should have walked only by faith in the Lord&#8217;s word, not by the sight of the circumstances (2 Cor. 5:7). When Peter cried out for help, &#8220;Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?&#8221; (Matt. 14:31). Since the Lord had said to Peter, &#8220;Come&#8221; (v. 29), Peter should have stood on that word and not doubted. Hence, the Lord rebuked him.<p>Faith comes from the Lord&#8217;s word and stands on the Lord&#8217;s word. As long as we have the Lord&#8217;s word, we should simply believe His word and not doubt.<h2 class=head4>c. Calming the Wind</h2><p>The Lord Jesus not only saved His followers from the storm but also calmed the wind. &#8220;When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased&#8221; (v. 32). The Lord&#8217;s presence caused the storm to cease. This was a miracle that testifies that the Lord is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth and that He cares for the hardships of His followers as they follow Him.<h2 class=head3>32. The Crumbs under the Table</h2><p>In Matthew 15:22-28 Christ is revealed as the crumbs, the fragments of bread, under the table.<h2 class=head4>a. Despised and Rejected by the Children- the Children of Israel</h2><p>In verse 26 the Lord Jesus said to the Canaanite woman, &#8220;It is not good to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw it to the little dogs.&#8221; The children in this verse are the Jews, the children of Israel (v. 24). Here the Lord unveiled Himself to the Canaanite woman as bread. Christ came to the children of Israel as the bread of life (John 6:35), who came down from heaven to satisfy the hunger of the world. The Jews, however, refused to receive Him. The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel. But they despised and rejected Him, throwing Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile country.<h2 class=head4>b. Received and Enjoyed by the Gentile Dogs</h2><p>In reply to the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the children&#8217;s bread, the Canaanite woman said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table&#8221; (Matt. 14:27). Here we see that the Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord&#8217;s word but rather admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. She realized that Christ, the children&#8217;s bread, had become broken crumbs as her portion. Such a Christ is also our portion for our experience and enjoyment.<h2 class=head4>c. Through Faith in Him</h2><p>We may enjoy Christ as the crumbs under the table through our faith in Him. This is revealed by the Lord&#8217;s word in verse 28: &#8220;O woman, great is your faith!&#8221; This indicates that the Canaanite woman&#8217;s dealings with the Lord were by faith, and her faith was great. To receive and enjoy Christ as the crumbs under the table, we need to have faith in Him. Like the Canaanite woman, we need to exercise faith to take in Christ as the crumbs to be our life supply.<h2 class=head3>33. The Christ, the Son of the Living God</h2><p>In Matthew 16:16-19 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The revelation here is crucial, for it concerns God&#8217;s economy, His eternal purpose.<h2 class=head4>a. The Christ Referring to His Commission for the Accomplishment of God&#8217;s Purpose to Have the Church</h2><p>In Matthew 16:16 Peter, receiving revelation from the Father, declared concerning the Lord Jesus, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#8221; The Christ is a title of the Lord Jesus according to His office, His commission. This title refers to the Lord&#8217;s commission for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s purpose to have the church. Christ&#8217;s commission is to accomplish God&#8217;s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent.<p>Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos, which is equivalent to the Hebrew word Messiah. Both Messiah in Hebrew and Christos in Greek mean &#8220;the anointed One.&#8221; According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed. For the carrying out of God&#8217;s administration, the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the anointed One.<h2 class=head4>b. The Son of the Living God Referring to His Person for the Producing of the Many Sons of God to Be Members of the Church</h2><p>Whereas Christ is the title of the Lord according to His commission, the Son of the living God is His title according to His person. His commission is a matter of God&#8217;s work, and His person is a matter of God&#8217;s life. The Lord&#8217;s person embodies the Father and issues in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God.<p>The Lord&#8217;s person as the Son of God is for the producing of the many sons of God to be members of the church. Christ is the One to accomplish God&#8217;s purpose to have the church. The Son of God is the One who produces many sons of God to be the many members formed into the church as the one Body. It is in this way that God has the church.<h2 class=head4>c. The Church Being Built upon This Revelation of the Christ and the Son of the Living God</h2><p>The church is built upon this revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God. Immediately after Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, &#8220;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&#8221; (v. 18a). This rock refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God which Peter received from the Father. First, the rock refers to the wonderful person of Christ, the Son of the living God. Second, the rock refers to the revelation of this person. When we see this revelation, it becomes the rock upon which the church is built. Wherever we go, we must preach and teach the Christ and the Son of the living God so that many more sons may be produced to be the members of the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head4>d. To Deal with the Gates of Hades- the Power of Satan- and to Establish the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The church built upon the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God deals with the gates of Hades and establishes the kingdom of the heavens. In verse 18b, the Lord, speaking of the church, says, &#8220;The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&#8221; The gates of Hades refers to Satan&#8217;s authority or power of darkness. Because Satan&#8217;s power of darkness attacks the church, there is spiritual warfare between Satan&#8217;s power, which is his kingdom (12:26) and the church, which is God&#8217;s kingdom. The gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church built upon the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God. God wants to have the church with the intention, the goal, to deal with His enemy Satan and his power.<p>Such a church not only deals with the gates of Hades but also establishes the kingdom of the heavens. This is indicated by the Lord&#8217;s word in 16:19: &#8220;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens.&#8221; The kingdom of the heavens here is used interchangeably for church in verse 18. This proves that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age.<p>These verses reveal that the church has a twofold purpose. On the negative side, the church deals with the power of Satan. On the positive side, the church establishes the kingdom of the heavens.<h2 class=head4>e. Through Our Following Him</h2><p>The church is built upon the revelation of the Christ and of the Son of God through our following Him. &#8220;Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&#8221; (v. 24). Before the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion the disciples followed Him in an outward way. But after His resurrection we follow Him in an inward way. Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) dwelling in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), we follow Him in our spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25).<h2 class=head5>(1) By Denying Our Self</h2><p>We follow the Lord by denying our self. To deny our self is to forfeit our soul-life, our natural life (Matt. 16:26; Luke 9:25).<p>In Matthew 16:23-25 three things are related: the mind, the self, and the soul-life. Our mind is the expression of our self, and our self is the embodiment of our soul-life. Therefore, to lose the soul-life is the reality of denying the self.<h2 class=head5>(2) Taking Up Our Cross, Remaining under the Death of Christ for the Terminating of Our Self, Our Natural Life, and Our Old Man</h2><p>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus speaks of the taking up of the cross. The cross is not merely a suffering; it is also a killing. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, have first been crucified with Him and then we bear the cross today. To us, bearing the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man. In so doing we deny our self that we may follow the Lord. Through this kind of following of the Lord Jesus the church is built up.<h2 class=head3>34. The Only One Whom We Should Hear</h2><p>In Matthew 17:3-8 Christ is revealed as the only One whom we should hear. The Lord brought Peter, James, and John &#8220;up to a high mountain privately. And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him&#8221; (vv. 1-3). Peter proposed that he make three tents, one for the Lord, one for Moses, and one for Elijah (v. 4). &#8220;While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!&#8221; (v. 5).<h2 class=head4>a. Not Moses-the Law, nor Elijah-the Prophets</h2><p>Moses represented the law, and Elijah, the prophets. The law and the prophets were the constituents of the Old Testament as a full testimony of Christ (John 5:39). Today, since Christ has come, we should not listen to Moses or to Elijah.<p>Peter&#8217;s absurd proposal was to put Moses and Elijah on the same level with Christ, which means to make the law and the prophets equal to Christ. This was absolutely contrary to God&#8217;s economy. In God&#8217;s economy the law and the prophets were only a testimony to Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him.<h2 class=head4>b. Jesus Himself Only</h2><p>In Matthew 17:5 the voice from out of the cloud said that we should hear the Son. In God&#8217;s economy, after Christ came, we should &#8220;hear Him,&#8221; no longer the law or the prophets, since the law and the prophets were fulfilled in Christ and by Christ.<p>&#8220;When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone&#8221; (v. 8). Peter proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, that is, the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving &#8220;no one except Jesus Himself alone.&#8221; The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality; the reality is Christ. Now that Christ, the reality, is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed. No one except Jesus Himself alone should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today&#8217;s Moses, imparting the law of life into His believers. Jesus is also today&#8217;s Elijah, speaking for God and speaking forth God within His believers. Today we do not have the law or the prophets. We only have a living person, the all-inclusive Jesus Christ. This is God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><h2 class=head3>35. The Son of God</h2><p>In Matthew 17:24-26 Christ is revealed as the Son of God. Verse 24 says, &#8220;When they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?&#8221; To this question Peter said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; (v. 25a). The temple tax was a Jewish poll tax for the temple, equal to half a shekel (Exo. 30:12-16; 38:26). Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ&#8217;s being the Son of God (Matt. 16:16-17), and he had seen the vision of the Son of God (17:5). But here, in application, he was put to the test by the temple-tax gatherers&#8217; question. He failed in his answer by forgetting the revelation he had received and the vision he had seen. He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God who did not need to pay the temple tax for His Father&#8217;s house.<p>When Peter came into the house, &#8220;Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers? And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free&#8221; (vv. 25b-26). The sons of kings are always free from paying custom or poll tax. The temple tax was not a tax paid to the secular government. It was collected for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the temple of God, God&#8217;s house on earth. According to Exodus 30 and 38, every Israelite had to pay a half shekel to care for the Lord&#8217;s house. Because Jesus is the Son of God, there was no need for Him to pay this tax. When the Lord Jesus said that the sons are free, He was indicating that He, as the Son of God, was free from paying the temple tax.<h2 class=head4>a. Freeing the Believers from the Obligation of the Law</h2><p>The Son of God frees the believers from the obligation of keeping the law. Apart from Christ, the Son of God, we are under the obligation to keep the law. But since we now have the Son of God and are in Him, He sets us free from the obligation of the law.<p>Galatians 2:4b and 5:1 speak of the believers&#8217; freedom from the law. In Galatians 2:4b Paul refers to &#8220;our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Freedom here is freedom from the bondage of the law. Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations. Those who try to keep the law place themselves under slavery and thus serve the law as slaves. The Son of God has freed us from all such obligation.<p>In 5:1 Paul says, &#8220;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.&#8221; The freedom here also denotes freedom from the slavery of the law. Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace. To &#8220;stand fast&#8221; is to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of the law, not deviating from Christ. The Greek word here translated entangled may also be rendered &#8220;held ensnared.&#8221; To deviate from Christ to the law is to be entangled or held ensnared. The &#8220;yoke of slavery&#8221; is the bondage of law, which makes the law-keepers slaves under a binding yoke. Christ, the Son of God, has set us free from this yoke.<h2 class=head4>b. By Their Being in Him as the Sons of God</h2><p>It is by being in Christ as sons of God that the believers are freed from the obligation of the law. We are sons of God in Christ, the Son of God. Because we are in Him, we are freed from the law.<p>Galatians 3:26 and 27 indicate that the believers are sons of God by being in Christ. &#8220;You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&#8221; To believe is to believe into Christ (John 3:16), and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ. Faith in Christ brings us into Christ and makes us one with Christ, in whom is the sonship. We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may be sons of God. By both faith and baptism we have been immersed into Christ; we have thus put on Christ; and we have become identified with Him. We and Christ have been joined in a marvelous organic union. Because of this union, we are sons of God.<h2 class=head3>36. The One into Whose Name the Believers Are Gathered Together</h2><p>The Lord Jesus Christ is the One into whose name the believers are gathered together. Concerning this, Matthew 18:20 says, &#8220;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&#8221; The Lord Jesus gathers us not in His name but into His name. In the principle of the New Testament, the name denotes the person. Since the name is the person, to be gathered into the Lord&#8217;s name is to be gathered into the Lord Himself. Furthermore, the name of the Lord Jesus is very much linked to the Holy Spirit. Actually, the Spirit is the reality of the Lord&#8217;s name. The Lord&#8217;s name denotes His person, and the reality of the Lord&#8217;s person is the Spirit. This means that to be gathered into the name of the Lord, that is, into the Lord Himself, is to be gathered into the Spirit.<h2 class=head4>a. For Meeting</h2><p>Our being gathered together by the Lord into His name is for the purpose of meeting. The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name. The most crucial thing in the believers&#8217; meeting is to be gathered into the Lord&#8217;s name. Because we are the Lord&#8217;s and have been saved by His name, we should gather only in that name and meet only in that name. We must not gather into and meet in any other name.<p>For the meetings we need to be gathered out of so many other things into the Lord&#8217;s name, into His person. We especially need to be brought out of the self. We cannot be gathered together into the Lord&#8217;s name if we stay in the self. For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name.<h2 class=head4>b. To Enjoy His Presence in Their Midst</h2><p>Matthew 18:20 says that where there are two or three gathered into the Lord&#8217;s name, He is in their midst. The Lord Jesus gathers us into His name so that we may enjoy His presence in our midst. His presence is our enjoyment. Whenever we are gathered into the Lord&#8217;s name, into His person, we enjoy His presence in a special way, and His presence brings us enlightenment, grace, supply, and all kinds of blessing.<h2 class=head3>37. The King</h2><p>In Matthew 21:1-11 Christ is presented as the King, in particular, as the meek King. Shortly before the end of His life, the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem as the King. Even though the people despised Him and rejected Him, He came to them as the King.<h2 class=head4>a. Meek and Lowly</h2><p>Verse 5 says, &#8220;&#8216;Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.&#8217;&#8221; This signifies the humble and lowly state in which the Lord Jesus was willing to be, for the donkey and the colt together give an impression of meekness and humility. The heavenly King did not come with haughty splendor but with gentle, humble meekness.<p>The presence of the colt testified that the Lord Jesus did not come to Jerusalem to fight or to compete. Rather, He was meek and lowly. This, I believe, was the impression that He wanted to convey to the people. Yes, the Lord Jesus was the heavenly King, but He did not have the intention to come as a great King fighting or competing with others. He came as a meek, lowly King who did not fight against anyone or compete with anyone.<h2 class=head4>b. Coming in the Name of the Lord</h2><p>Matthew 21:9 says, &#8220;The crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&#8221; The Hebrew word hosanna means &#8220;save now&#8221; (Psa. 118:25). The title Son of David was the royal title of the meek, lowly King. In their warm welcome of the heavenly King, the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118: &#8220;Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah&#8221; (v. 26). According to this psalm, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in this way. Thus, the spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King did not come in His own name but in the name of Jehovah. (Here Lord equals Jehovah.) Those who welcomed the Lord Jesus as the King indicated through their praise that He was the One sent by the Lord, thus the One who came in the name of the Lord.<h2 class=head3>38. The Cornerstone of God&#8217;s Building</h2><p>In Matthew 21:42 and 43 we see that Christ is the cornerstone of God&#8217;s building. In verse 42 Jesus said to the Jewish leaders, &#8220;Have you never read in the Scriptures, &#8216;The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes&#8217;?&#8221; The stone here is Christ for God&#8217;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4). Christ is not only the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16) and the topstone (Zech. 4:7) but also the cornerstone. In Matthew 21:42 Christ is referred to as the cornerstone, not as the foundation, because the emphasis here is on the cornerstone that joins the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers.<h2 class=head4>a. Rejected by the Jewish Leaders</h2><p>The builders in Matthew 21:42 are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God&#8217;s building. The Lord&#8217;s word here unveiled the Jewish leaders&#8217; rejection of Him and God&#8217;s honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth. When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone which joins the Jews and the Gentiles for the building of God&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head4>b. Trusted by the Church for the Producing of Fruit</h2><p>Whereas Christ was rejected by the Jewish builders, He is trusted by the church for the producing of fruit. This is indicated by the Lord&#8217;s word in Matthew 21:43. &#8220;Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit.&#8221; This nation is the church, which trusts in the Lord as the cornerstone (1 Pet. 2:6).<h2 class=head3>39. A Hen</h2><p>In Matthew 23:37 the Lord Jesus likens Himself to a hen.<h2 class=head4>a. Desiring to Gather His Young under His Wings</h2><p>In verse 37 the Lord, speaking to Jerusalem, says, &#8220;How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!&#8221; It has always been God Himself who cared for Jerusalem, like a bird fluttering over her young (Isa. 31:5; Deut. 32:11-12). Hence, when the Lord spoke these words, He was indicating that He was God Himself. The Lord is like a loving bird, fluttering, brooding, over her young.<h2 class=head4>b. Rejected by the Jews</h2><p>Often the Lord desired to gather the children of Jerusalem together, but they were not willing. As He was declaring a final word to them, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out her wings to brood over the little ones. But they were not willing to be gathered under His wings.<h2 class=head4>c. Received by the Believers</h2><p>Although the Lord was rejected by the Jews, He is received by the believers.<h2 class=head3>40. The One Given All Authority in Heaven and on Earth</h2><p>At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, a book on the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord Jesus presents Himself as the One given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18-20). Matthew 28:18 says, &#8220;Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&#8221; In His divinity as the only begotten Son of God, the Lord had authority over all. However, in His humanity as the Son of Man to be the King of the heavenly kingdom, all authority in heaven and on earth had to be given to Him after His resurrection.<h2 class=head4>a. For the Believers to Disciple All the Nations, Baptizing Them into the Triune God</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s being given all authority is for the believers to disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God. In 28:19 and 20a the Lord Jesus tells us, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have I commanded you.&#8221; Because all authority had been given to Him, the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple the nations. They go with His authority to disciple the nations. To disciple the nations is to make the heathen the kingdom people for the establishment of God&#8217;s kingdom, which is the church, even today, on earth.<p>The believers have not yet fulfilled adequately the commandment, the charge, given by the Lord Jesus in verse 19. To bring people to Christ and to make them believers is one thing, but to disciple them is another thing. Among Christians today we can see the making of sinners into believers, but we cannot see much discipling of the nations. The Lord, however, has commanded us to disciple the nations, to disciple the Gentiles. To disciple others is to make them genuine subjects of the heavenly kingdom. This is the goal that we want to carry out in our practice of the God-ordained way. Our goal is not simply to bring sinners to the Lord so that they may be saved and become believers. Our aim is to follow the Lord&#8217;s charge to disciple people, to make them the proper subjects of the heavenly kingdom.<p>If we are to disciple the nations, we must baptize those who receive our gospel preaching into the name, the person, of the Triune God. The Lord charges us to baptize the believing sinners into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Since the name signifies the person, to baptize the believers into the name of the Triune God is to baptize them into the person of the Triune God, into the living person of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, so that they may have an organic union with the Triune God. When we baptize others, we are actually putting them into the Triune God.<h2 class=head4>b. The Believers Enjoying His Presence All the Days until the Consummation of the Age</h2><p>After charging us to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age&#8221; (v. 20b). Christ, the heavenly King, is Emmanuel, God with us (Matt. 1:23). Here He promises to be with us until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age, which will be the time of His parousia (coming).<p>When we go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we enjoy the Lord&#8217;s presence all the days. We will enjoy His presence every day until the consummation of the age. As we approach the consummation of the age, we enjoy the presence of the Lord Jesus, the One who is the embodiment of the Triune God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(9)</h1><h2 class=head3>41. The Center of the Processed Triune God</h2><p>The Christ revealed in the entire book of Matthew is the center of the processed Triune God (28:19). Matthew and John are the two books in which the Trinity is more fully revealed. In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit (v. 18), Christ (the Son-v. 18), and God (the Father-v. 23) are upon the scene for the producing of the man Jesus (v. 21), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the embodiment of the Triune God. In chapter three Matthew presents a picture of the Son standing in the water of baptism under the opened heaven, the Spirit as a dove descending upon the Son, and the Father out of heaven speaking to the Son (vv. 16-17). In chapter twelve the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father (v. 28). In chapter sixteen the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom (vv. 16-19). In chapter seventeen the Son entered into transfiguration (v. 2) and was confirmed by the Father&#8217;s word of delight (v. 5) for a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom (16:28). Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ, as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b), had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples, in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection, to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Such a Christ is the center of the processed Triune God.<h2 class=head4>a. The Father Being Expressed in the Son</h2><p>In the Godhead the Father is the source, and the Son is His expression. The Father dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), but the Son has come as the expression of the Father, the expression of the unapproachable and invisible God (John 1:18). Hence, the Father is expressed in the Son. The Son is the coming out of God and also the expression of the Father. Because the Son expresses the Father, He is the expression of the Father. Furthermore, because the Son expresses not Himself but the Father, the Son&#8217;s expression is the Father&#8217;s expression. Therefore, to see the Son is to see the Father who is expressed in the Son.<h2 class=head4>b. The Son Being Realized as the Spirit</h2><p>The Son, who is the expression of the Father, is realized as the Spirit. In John 14:10 and 11 the Lord Jesus reveals that He is one with the Father-the Father is in Him and He is in the Father. Then in verses 16 through 20 He reveals that He is realized as the Spirit. The &#8220;He&#8221; who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the &#8220;I&#8221; who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. This means that, after His resurrection, the Lord became the Spirit of reality. First Corinthians 15:45 confirms this.<p>Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we may use three crucial words: source, expression, and realization. The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression of the Father as the source. Furthermore, the Spirit is the realization of the Son as the Father&#8217;s expression. As the realization of the Son, the Spirit has come into us to be experienced, enjoyed, and possessed by us. Since the Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the expression of the Father as the source, we have the source, the expression, and the realization. Because the Father is expressed in the Son and the Son is realized as the Spirit, Christ the Son is the center of the processed Triune God.<h2 class=head4>c. For the Disciples to Baptize People into the Processed Triune God by Baptizing Them into Him</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s being the center of the processed Triune God is for the disciples to baptize people into the processed Triune God by baptizing them into Him. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus charged His disciples, saying, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here the disciples are commanded to baptize people into the name of the Triune God. However, according to Acts and the Epistles, in actuality they baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:16; 19:5; Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). This indicates that baptizing people into the name of the Lord Jesus is equal to baptizing them into the name of the Triune God, for Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God and even the center of the processed Triune God. Therefore, when we baptize people into Christ, we baptize them into the Triune God.<p>In the eight previous messages and in this message, we have seen a bird&#8217;s-eye view, an overall view, of different aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment in the Gospel of Matthew. This book shows us Christ first as the Son of David and last as the center of the processed Triune God. In between we have seen thirty-nine other aspects of Christ for us to experience and enjoy. We need to realize that even in this one Gospel Christ is revealed in so many aspects for our experience and enjoyment. In particular, we may experience and enjoy Him as the Son of David and eventually as the center, the embodiment, of the processed Triune God.<p>Although in these messages I am not teaching theology, I would still like to point out that theologically speaking Matthew is a deep book.<p>First, in Matthew we can see Christ&#8217;s divinity; He, along with the Father and the Spirit, is one of the Divine Trinity. Christ is the Son with the Father embodied in Him, and this Christ is realized as the Spirit. This is His divinity.<p>In Matthew we can see not only Christ&#8217;s divinity but also His humanity, for He was born of a human virgin (1:18). Christ was first born into Mary and then He was born out of Mary. God was born into Mary, and the man Jesus was born out of Mary. Therefore, this wonderful One is the God-man. As such, He possesses two natures-the divine nature and the human nature.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived the divine life in His human living. God&#8217;s life was lived in Jesus&#8217; living. Because this wonderful One, the God-man, lived the divine life in a human living, His human virtues were filled with the divine attributes. The divine attributes were expressed in His human virtues. The totality of this expression of the divine attributes in the Lord&#8217;s human virtues is simply virtue. Virtue is a virtuous strength or energy that can heal people and change and transform them.<p>Christ is the One with divinity and humanity, the One who expresses the divine attributes in His human virtues. For this reason, with the Lord Jesus we can see beauty, excellence, and attractiveness, and with this attractiveness there is always a kind of transfusion. We cannot see Him or touch Him without receiving a transfusion from Him. Even if we take a glance at Him, we will experience His transfusion. If we look upon Him, we will have His transfusion-either a transfusion of love that will cause us to love Him or a transfusion of faith that will cause us to believe in Him. Loving the Lord Jesus is not a matter of our ability to love; it is altogether a matter of His being lovable and of His being worthy to be loved. His attractiveness spontaneously infuses the loving element into us, and by this loving element we love Him. Everyone who has touched the Lord Jesus loves Him. We simply need to touch Him once or have a glimpse of Him, and the loving element by which we love Him is transfused into us. The principle is the same with faith. As we touch Him or look upon Him, faith is transfused into us, and we believe in Him.<p>Because we love the Lord Jesus and believe in Him, we may now experience Him and enjoy Him as the many items revealed in Matthew. In the twenty-eight chapters of this book, Christ is presented to us as at least forty-one items, the last of which is the center, the embodiment, of the processed Triune God. As the center and embodiment of the processed Triune God, Christ is realized as the life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit. Christ, the One who is the Son of David, our Escort, and so many other items, eventually consummates in the Spirit. The Father and the Son consummate in the Spirit, and it is as the Spirit that the Lord is with us all the days (28:20).<p>We all need to see what the Gospel of Matthew is. This Gospel is a record showing us that Christ has both divinity and humanity and that His divine attributes are expressed in His human virtues. All the items of what He is consummate in the Holy Spirit for our experience and enjoyment. If we see this, Matthew will become a new book to us. May we all experience, enjoy, and preach to others the Christ revealed in the Gospel of Matthew.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(10)</h1><p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Luke. Among the books of the New Testament, Luke occupies a particular place concerning Christ&#8217;s being our Savior. The subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality. The intention of this Gospel is to present Jesus Christ as a real man with a proper humanity full of human virtues. As such a One, He is our human Savior.<p>Because Luke&#8217;s Gospel is one of the synoptic Gospels concerning the Savior&#8217;s humanity, its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect man, revealing God among men in His saving grace to fallen mankind. This Gospel narrates a complete genealogy of the man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind. This shows that He is a genuine descendant of man-a son of man. Its record of this man&#8217;s life impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity. Hence, its emphasis is the Man-Savior.<h2 class=head3>42. The Rising Sun</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Rising from on High</h2><p>&#8220;Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun will visit us from on high, to shine upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace&#8221; (1:78-79). These verses reveal that our human Savior came not from the earth but from &#8220;on high,&#8221; indicating that His source is the heavens. He came from the heavens as the rising sun.<h2 class=head4>b. To Appear to Those Sitting in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death</h2><p>As the rising sun Christ appeared to those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death. Jesus the Savior was the dawning sun to the dark age. His coming ended the night of the Old Testament and began the day of the New Testament. As the One who is light to us (John 9:5; Matt. 4:16), He is the accomplisher and the center of God&#8217;s redemption that His people may obtain salvation.<p>Before Christ came, the earth was in a dark night. With His coming as the sun, there was the dawning of day, and the earth began to be enlightened by Him. If He had not been the rising sun dispelling the darkness that covered the earth, He could not have been our Savior. In order to be the Savior, He had to be the One full of light shining not from the earth but from heaven.<h2 class=head4>c. To Guide Our Feet into the Way of Peace</h2><p>Christ has shined upon us in order to guide our feet into the way of peace. When we were in darkness and in the shadow of death, we were walking on a way in which there was no peace. However, now that we have been saved, having received Christ as our Savior, we can testify that we are in the way of peace. Our feet are being guided to take the peaceful way. The Christian life is a life of peace. This is altogether due to Christ&#8217;s shining.<h2 class=head3>43. The Savior</h2><p>The birth of the Man-Savior was announced to shepherds by an angel as good news of great joy to all people (Luke 2:8-10). In verse 11 the angel declared, &#8220;Today a Savior has been born to you in David&#8217;s city, who is Christ the Lord.&#8221; In John 4:42 the Lord Jesus is referred to as the Savior of the world. Christ is the Savior in order to save us. He is the Savior of fallen mankind based upon His person and His redemptive work. He is the ever-existing Triune God who became a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full redemption for us, the sinners, through which He may now save us from God&#8217;s condemnation and from our fallen condition.<h2 class=head3>44. A Light and the Glory</h2><p>Luke 2:32 tells us that Christ is light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of God&#8217;s people Israel.<h2 class=head4>a. A Light for Revelation to the Gentiles</h2><p>It is not easy to understand the expression a light for revelation in verse 32. This refers to a kind of shining, a kind of enlightening, that brings revelation to us. Before we experienced this shining, we were in darkness, knowing nothing about the universe, human life, and God. In other words, we did not have any revelation. But after Christ came to us as a light for revelation, we knew where we came from and where we are going. We also knew the mystery and the meaning of human life. Many wonderful revelations have come to us, especially the revelation concerning the person and work of Christ.<p>We all have experienced and enjoyed Christ in this way. No matter where we were born, before we were saved, we were all in darkness and were without revelation. When Christ came to us, He came as the light for revelation to the Gentiles to enlighten us and to reveal to us so many secrets and mysteries of the universe. As the One who is a light for revelation to the Gentiles, Christ exercises Himself to bring us into His light and to reveal things to us concerning God, man, and the universe.<h2 class=head4>b. The Glory of God&#8217;s People Israel</h2><p>Christ is not only a light for revelation to the Gentiles but also the glory of God&#8217;s people Israel. In this verse the words glory and light are synonyms. To the Gentiles Christ is light mainly for revelation; to God&#8217;s people Israel Christ is light mainly for glory. The people of Israel have lost their glory because they have rejected Christ, the human Savior, who is to them the light as their glory. Due to their rejection of Christ, the Jews today do not have any glory. But when they receive Christ, He, the human Savior, will become their glory.<h2 class=head3>45. A Moneylender</h2><p>In 7:41 and 42 the Lord Jesus likens Himself to a moneylender. Simon, a Pharisee who had invited Him to his house, was troubled by the fact that He allowed a sinful woman to wet His feet with her tears, to wipe them with her hair, to kiss them affectionately, and to anoint them with ointment. Speaking to Simon, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;A certain moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty. But since they had nothing with which to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?&#8221; Simon considered only the woman, not himself, a sinner. However, the Savior&#8217;s parable indicated that He was the moneylender and that both Simon the Pharisee and the woman were sinners-debtors to Him-needing His forgiveness. Today we all are in debt to the Lord Jesus as the moneylender. We are His debtors, and He is our creditor.<h2 class=head4>a. Forgiving All His Debtors Graciously</h2><p>In His parable the Lord said that since the two debtors had nothing with which to repay the moneylender, he graciously forgave them both. This indicates that sinners have nothing with which to repay their debt to God their Savior. Nevertheless, He forgives all His debtors graciously.<p>As the moneylender in this parable, Christ is the incarnation of the forgiving God; therefore, as the very God, He has the authority to forgive sins. The divine ability to forgive sins is expressed through the Savior&#8217;s human virtues, portraying Christ as the One with the highest standard of morality. As such a One, He is the moneylender who forgives His debtors.<h2 class=head4>b. Receiving Love from His Debtors</h2><p>From his debtors the moneylender did not receive repayment-he received love. In verse 42 the Lord Jesus asked Simon which of the debtors would love the moneylender more as a result of having been forgiven by him. This indicates that love to the Savior is the issue, not the cause, of His forgiveness. When we experience the Lord&#8217;s gracious forgiveness, we respond with love for Him. However, our love may differ in degree, depending on how much we have experienced His forgiveness. This was the reason for the Lord&#8217;s word to Simon in verse 47: &#8220;To whom little is forgiven, he loves little.&#8221; The woman&#8217;s loving much was a proof that her many sins had been forgiven; Simon&#8217;s loving little testified that he had been forgiven only a little.<p>Concerning the experience and enjoyment of Christ as a moneylender, we need to pay attention to the three matters of faith, love, and peace. The Lord&#8217;s word about love in verse 42 indicates clearly that love is the issue of forgiveness, that love comes after forgiveness instead of preceding it. The cause of the forgiveness of sins is faith. This is why the Lord Jesus eventually said to the woman, &#8220;Your faith has saved you. Go in peace&#8221; (v. 50). It was the woman&#8217;s faith that had saved her. Her sins were forgiven not because of her love but because of her faith. Therefore, faith comes before forgiveness, and love follows faith. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, our faith becomes the cause of the Lord&#8217;s forgiveness of our sins. Then as a result of having our sins forgiven, we begin to love the Lord. As we love Him, this love issues in peace. Then we may walk in peace, which means to live in peace, to have a life of peace. Thus, when we believe in the Lord, we love Him and live a life of peace. This is the Christian life.<h2 class=head3>46. A Samaritan</h2><p>In the parable of the good Samaritan (10:25-37) Christ is portrayed as a compassionate Samaritan saving the wounded. The Samaritan in this parable signifies the Man-Savior, who apparently was a layman of low estate. He was despised and slandered as a low and mean Samaritan (John 8:48; 4:9) by the self-exalted and self-justified Pharisees.<h2 class=head4>a. Taking Care of the Fallen and Law-stricken Sinner with Compassion</h2><p>This Samaritan took care of the fallen and law-stricken sinner with compassion (Luke 10:30-33). Verse 30 says, &#8220;A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who having both stripped him and beaten him, went away, leaving him half dead.&#8221; Jerusalem means &#8220;foundation of peace&#8221; (cf. Heb. 7:2), and Jericho was a city of curse (Josh. 6:26; 1 Kings 16:34). The words going down indicate falling from the city of the foundation of peace to the city of curse. The man in this parable was taking the way of such a fall. The &#8220;robbers&#8221; signify the legalistic teachers of the Judaic law (John 10:1), who used the law (1 Cor. 15:56) to rob the lawkeepers. The word stripped signifies the stripping caused by the Judaistic teachers&#8217; misuse of the law. The Greek word translated beaten literally means &#8220;laid blows on.&#8221; This beating signifies the killing by the law (Rom. 7:9-10). Furthermore, the robbers&#8217; leaving the man half dead signifies the Judaistic teachers&#8217; leaving the lawkeeper in a dead condition (Rom. 7:11, 13).<p>Luke 10:33 speaks of the compassion of a certain Samaritan who saw the man who had fallen among robbers. &#8220;But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion.&#8221; This Samaritan signifies that the Man-Savior, in His lost-one-seeking and sinner-saving ministry journey (19:10), came down to the place where the wounded victim of the Judaizing robbers was in his miserable and dying condition. When He saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity. It is important to note that 10:33 speaks not of mercy but of compassion. Compassion is more inward than mercy, issuing from one&#8217;s tender, inward feeling.<h2 class=head4>b. Healing Him with the Spirit and the Divine Life and Putting Him into the Church</h2><p>Verses 34 and 35 describe the Samaritan&#8217;s actions in rendering to the stripped and beaten one tender healing and saving care, fully meeting his urgent need. All the aspects of the good Samaritan&#8217;s care for the dying one portray the Man-Savior in His merciful, tender, and bountiful care, in His humanity with His divinity, for a sinner condemned under law, showing to the uttermost His high standard of morality in His saving grace.<p>&#8220;He came to him and bound up his wounds and poured oil and wine on them&#8221; (v. 34a). The binding up of the wounds indicates that He healed him. Pouring oil and wine on the man&#8217;s wounds signifies giving Him the Holy Spirit and the divine life. When the Man-Savior came to us, He poured His Spirit and His divine life on our wounds. The Holy Spirit and the divine life are initial gifts received by all the believers (1 Cor. 1:7). Both of these gifts have been given to us for our healing. From the time we were saved, we have surely experienced the healing of the Holy Spirit with the divine life. The Spirit is the soothing oil, and the divine life is the element that cheers us up through the Spirit.<p>Luke 10:34b says, &#8220;Placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.&#8221; This indicates that He brought him to the church and took care of him through the church. Today the local church is an &#8220;inn&#8221; through which the Man-Savior takes care of us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(11)</h1><p>In this message we will cover five more aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in the Gospel of Luke.<h2 class=head3>47. A Sheep-finder</h2><p>In 15:3-32 the Lord Jesus spoke three parables depicting how the Divine Trinity works to bring sinners back, through the Son and by the Spirit, to the Father. In the first parable (vv. 4-7) Christ is portrayed as a sheep-finder, as a man seeking and finding the lost sheep.<h2 class=head4>a. Coming to the World-the Wilderness</h2><p>&#8220;Which man of you, who has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?&#8221; (v. 4). Here the &#8220;wilderness&#8221; signifies the world. In the sight of God the world is a wild, desolate place where it is easy to get lost. The sheep-finder&#8217;s going into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep indicates that the Son has come to the world to be with men (John 1:14).<h2 class=head4>b. Finding the Lost Sheep and Bringing It Back</h2><p>The Son came in His humanity as a sheep-finder to find the sinner as a lost sheep and to bring it back home. Concerning this Luke 15:5 and 6 say, &#8220;And when he finds it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes into his house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.&#8221; The sheep-finder&#8217;s laying the sheep on his shoulders shows the Savior&#8217;s saving strength and His saving love.<h2 class=head3>48. The Best Robe</h2><p>Luke 15:22 presents Christ as the best robe. In the parable of the father receiving the returned prodigal son (vv. 11-32), the son returned to his father and said, &#8220;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son&#8221; (v. 21). However, while he was still speaking, the father interrupted him and said to his slaves, &#8220;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him&#8221; (v. 22). The definite article the used with best robe indicates that a particular robe had been prepared for this particular purpose, and the slaves knew that this was the best robe. Literally, the Greek word translated best means &#8220;first.&#8221; When the son returned to his father, he was a poor beggar dressed in rags. But after the best robe was put on him, he was covered with a splendid garment prepared especially for him. With this best robe on, he was qualified to match his father.<h2 class=head4>a. The Righteousness God Prepared for the Returned Sinners</h2><p>This robe signifies the righteousness God prepared for the returned sinners. In particular, the robe signifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30).<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Be Justified by God Outwardly</h2><p>As the best robe, Christ is our righteousness for us to be justified by God outwardly. Hence, putting the best robe on the returned prodigal signifies justification in Christ. As those who have Christ as the best robe, we have been justified by God.<h2 class=head3>49. The Fattened Calf</h2><p>In Luke 15:23 Christ as the inward life for nourishment is typified by the fattened calf. Here the father in the parable of the returned prodigal says, &#8220;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry.&#8221; Although the prodigal was clothed with the best robe, he was still hungry and he must have been glad to hear his father speak about eating the fattened calf. Dressed in the best robe and standing in the presence of his father, the son might have said, &#8220;Father, the best robe is for your satisfaction, but I am hungry and need something to eat.&#8221; When they began to eat the fattened calf, the whole family began to be merry.<h2 class=head4>a. The Portion of the Life Supply Prepared by God for the Believing Sinners</h2><p>Whereas the best robe is the righteousness of God prepared for the returned sinners, the fattened calf is the portion of the life supply prepared by God for the believing sinners (1 Cor. 1:9). The fattened calf signifies the rich Christ (Eph. 3:8) killed on the cross for the believers&#8217; enjoyment. As we eat Christ as the fattened calf, taking Him into our being, we are filled with the divine life for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Be Satisfied Inwardly</h2><p>Whereas the best robe is for us to be justified outwardly, the fattened calf is for us to be satisfied inwardly. The robe is for wearing, but the fattened calf is for eating. Eating is the taking of something which is outside of you into you and then digesting it so that it becomes organically part of you. As the fattened calf, Christ is to be eaten, digested, and assimilated by us to become the very fibers of our being.<p>The parable of the returned prodigal shows us that God&#8217;s salvation is of two aspects: the outward objective aspect signified by the best robe and the inward subjective aspect signified by the fattened calf. Christ as our righteousness is for our outward salvation; Christ as our life and life supply is for our inward salvation. After coming back to his father, the prodigal son enjoyed all the riches of God&#8217;s provision in His salvation, a salvation that is not only a matter of wearing but also of eating. The best robe qualified the prodigal to match his father&#8217;s righteousness, and the fattened calf satisfied his hunger. Hence, the robe signifies the judicial aspect of God&#8217;s salvation, and the calf signifies the organic aspect of God&#8217;s salvation.<p>Today we are experiencing and enjoying Christ as our outward righteousness and as our inward life and life supply. Wearing Christ as our robe, we feed on Him as the fattened calf, digesting Him, assimilating Him, and being constituted with Him. As a result, we are sustained, satisfied, and strengthened, and we experience an inward, metabolic change.<h2 class=head3>50. The Kingdom of God</h2><p>Luke 17:20-24 reveals that Christ is the kingdom of God. The human Savior Himself is the essence and the element of the kingdom of God.<p>Regarding this, we need to consider the Lord&#8217;s word in verses 20b and 21, &#8220;The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.&#8221; The word you here refers to the questioning Pharisees. In the Lord&#8217;s answer to the Pharisees, there is the strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself. The Lord Jesus was telling the Pharisees that they could not see the kingdom of God, even though it was among them. The kingdom of God was present, but they did not have the spiritual perception to see it. We need spiritual eyes to see that the kingdom of God is actually the wonderful person of Christ Himself. Wherever He is, there the kingdom of God is.<h2 class=head4>a. As the Seed of the Kingdom of God Sown into the Believers to Develop into God&#8217;s Kingdom</h2><p>The fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark reveals that Christ is the seed of the kingdom of God sown into the believers to develop into God&#8217;s kingdom. Verse 3 says, &#8220;Behold, the sower went out to sow.&#8221; The sower here signifies the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, who came to sow Himself as the seed of life in His word (v. 14) into men&#8217;s hearts that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them.<p>Verse 26 says, &#8220;So is the kingdom of God: as if a man cast seed on the earth.&#8221; The &#8220;man&#8221; here is the Lord Jesus as the &#8220;sower&#8221; mentioned in verse 3. The &#8220;seed&#8221; is Christ as the seed of the divine life (1 John 3:9; 1 Pet. 1:23) sown into the believers. This seed of the kingdom is not a matter of power or authority but of the divine life embodied in Christ. This seed of the kingdom, this seed of life, is Christ Himself as the basic element of the kingdom. The kingdom of God, therefore, is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown as the seed of life into His believers. After this seed has been sown into them, it will grow in them and eventually develop into a kingdom.<p>Jesus Christ is the seed of the kingdom of God, and this seed has been sown into us, the believers. Now this seed is growing and developing within us. Eventually, this growth and development will have an issue, and this issue will be the kingdom.<p>As long as we have been saved and regenerated (John 3:3, 5), we are a part of the kingdom of God. We are a part of the kingdom not according to our old creation, which has nothing to do with the kingdom of God, but according to our new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). Now when we exercise the life of the new creation, the divine life received through our regeneration, we are exercising the kingdom of God. When we exercise that part of us which is the old creation, we are, in a practical way, living in the kingdom of Satan. But when we exercise that part of us which is the new creation-Christ Himself as the element of the kingdom of God-we are living in the kingdom of God.<h2 class=head4>b. Such a Kingdom Being within the Believers in the Church</h2><p>Such a kingdom is within the believers in the church. &#8220;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Rom. 14:17). This verse is a strong proof that the church in the present age is the kingdom of God, because the context deals with the church life in the present age.<p>The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose. In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. The kingdom within the believers in the church is thus a triangular life, a life of righteousness, peace, and joy. Righteousness denotes that which is right and proper. Those who live in the kingdom of God should be right and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God. This requires that they be strict in dealing with themselves. Peace, the fruit of righteousness (Heb. 12:11), characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God. If we are righteous toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. As a result, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God. In this way we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52) and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. The more we live righteously, peacefully, and joyfully in the Holy Spirit, the more the kingdom of God will be manifested in our daily living in the church life.<h2 class=head3>51. The One Prophesied in the Old Testament</h2><p>The last aspect of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of Luke concerns His being the One prophesied in the Old Testament. Luke 24:27 says, &#8220;Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&#8221; According to verse 44 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.&#8221; The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three sections of the Old Testament, that is, &#8220;all the Scriptures&#8221; (v. 27). The Savior&#8217;s word here unveils that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content.<h2 class=head4>a. For the Believers to Receive through Repentance for Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>Verse 47 says, &#8220;That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name.&#8221; This verse indicates that Christ as the One prophesied in the Old Testament is for the believers to receive through repentance for forgiveness of sins.<h2 class=head4>b. In His Death and Resurrection</h2><p>In verse 46 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day.&#8221; This indicates that it is in Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection that we receive Him as the One prophesied in the Old Testament.<p>The Gospel of Luke does not seem to contain much theology. However, this book covers two mysterious items in theology-Christ&#8217;s birth, which involves the divine incarnation, and Christ&#8217;s resurrection. No one can explain fully the incarnation and resurrection of Christ. Christ is God incarnated, and He is a man resurrected. Both the incarnation and the resurrection are necessary for Christ to be Christ. Christ is Christ because He is God incarnated and a man resurrected.<p>The conception and birth of Christ are a great mystery. The Bible reveals that the very God in His reaching element, the Holy Spirit, came into a human virgin and was born in her and of her. Concerning this, the angel said to Mary, &#8220;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God&#8221; (Luke 1:35). As the conception was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a &#8220;holy thing,&#8221; something intrinsically holy. This was Jesus our Savior.<p>Luke 1:35 seems to indicate that the Holy Spirit would be upon Mary only as the power for her to conceive the holy child. However, Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us that Mary &#8220;was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit&#8221; and that &#8220;that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary&#8217;s womb before she delivered the child Jesus. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and most excellent person of Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior.<p>The conception of the Savior was God&#8217;s incarnation (John 1:14), constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures-divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16) and might be a Man-Savior (Luke 2:11).<p>In addition to the mystery of Christ&#8217;s incarnation, Luke also speaks concerning Christ&#8217;s resurrection. He is the incarnated One and He is the resurrected One. As God He was incarnated to be a man. As a man He was put to death, and then He rose up from among the dead. Now He, the incarnated and resurrected One, is in resurrection. As the incarnated one, Christ brought God into man; as the resurrected One, He brought man into God. Today we receive Him as such a One, and we experience and enjoy the transaction whereby God comes into man and man is brought into God.<p>Christ, the incarnated and resurrected One, is our Savior. For our experience and enjoyment, this Savior is revealed in the Gospel of Luke as the rising sun, the light, the glory, a moneylender, a Samaritan, a sheep-finder, the best robe, the fattened calf, the kingdom of God, and the One prophesied in the Old Testament. This wonderful One is everything in God&#8217;s salvation.</body></html>
