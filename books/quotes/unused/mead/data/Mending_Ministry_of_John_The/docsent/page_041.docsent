   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OVERCOMING THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Your experience will confirm this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before you were saved, you loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even afterwards, the world still attracted you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever you still felt drawn to the world, however, you can testify that something within you was opposed to that attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was a part inside you that would not agree with your continuing to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your mind might dwell on worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your emotions might be stirred by the world's appeal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your will might lean toward the world's allure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your spirit, however, utterly refused to go along.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within you it was constantly hating the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is our spirit which overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us go along with this part!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not follow the dictates of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Begin early in the day by saying to the Lord, "Lord, thank You that I have a part within me that has been born of You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank You for my spirit, which overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Grant me the portion of grace for this day that I may live You by this part which has been born of You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank You, Lord, that I have such a part within me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not try to use another organ to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you want to see, you need to exercise your eyes, not your ears!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To overcome the world, the right organ is your regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not your clever mind or your strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your spirit was regenerated when you believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has been born of God, with God, and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This organ is capable of overcoming the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SEED OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God" 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse with "whosoever" seems to refer to the whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From 5:4, however, we know that only a part of us is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Notice the second part of the verse: "His seed remaineth in him."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The seed of God abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you want to grow some flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You buy the seeds and sow them into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seed is the seed of the flower, but it is also the flower itself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same is true of the seed of God; the seed of God is God Himself planted in you as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A few days after you plant the flower seeds, something will break through the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After another little period of time, sprouts will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before too long you will see the beautiful blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have planted carnation seeds, you will see the carnation blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What blossoms from the seed of God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This seed grows, sprouts, and blossoms God Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is a seed in us, growing until He Himself blossoms forth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not a human teaching, or Greek philosophical thought, or Chinese ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a heavenly truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Triune God, the almighty, infinite, eternal God has been sown into our spirit to grow Himself and to blossom Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this series of messages we have been considering how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have already said that we live Him by fellowship, by mutual abiding, and by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we add what we have covered here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We live Christ by the spirit born of God and by the seed of God which grows God from within us and blossoms Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because we have been born of God, we have the Spirit of God and the life of God within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of committing sin, this wonderful spirit overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us live Christ by the spirit and by this seed of God within us.</S>
