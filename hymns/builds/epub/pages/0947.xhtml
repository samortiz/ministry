<div class='line'><b>1</b> God's Kingdom today is a real exercise,</div>
<div class='line'>But when Christ comes to reign it will be a great prize;</div>
<div class='line'>It is wisdom divine that we now may be trained</div>
<div class='line'>That His plan be fulfilled and His justice maintained.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> God's children, we're born to be kings with His Son,</div>
<div class='line'>And we need to be trained that we may overcome</div>
<div class='line'>And to know how to rule in His kingdom as kings,</div>
<div class='line'>That His kingship thru us be expressed o'er all things.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Today we must learn to submit to His throne,</div>
<div class='line'>How to have a strict life and His government own;</div>
<div class='line'>His authority then we'll be able to share,</div>
<div class='line'>O'er the nations to rule with God's Son as the heir.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> With a life strict to self we must righteousness hold,</div>
<div class='line'>Kind to others in peace, and with God joyful, bold;</div>
<div class='line'>In the Kingdom's reality e'er to remain,</div>
<div class='line'>For its manifestation prepared thus to reign.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> Then Christ when He comes with the kingdom from God</div>
<div class='line'>Will to us grant His kingship to share as reward;</div>
<div class='line'>Thus the Lord will His righteousness thru us maintain</div>
<div class='line'>And His wisdom to heavenly powers make plain.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> For this the Apostle pressed on at all cost,</div>
<div class='line'>For the Kingdom assured that he would not be lost;</div>
<div class='line'>'Tis for this he charged others, Be true to the Lord,</div>
<div class='line'>That the Kingdom might be unto them a reward.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>7</b> O Lord, give us grace for Thy Kingdom to live,</div>
<div class='line'>To be trained that Thou may the reward to us give;</div>
<div class='line'>Make the Kingdom's reality our exercise,</div>
<div class='line'>That its manifestation may be our great prize.</div>
