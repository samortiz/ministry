   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING CHRIST'S RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 36:8 says, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In typology the fatness of the Lord's house refers to the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the riches that were offered to God in the house became the fatness of the Lord's house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fulfillment of this type is in Christ; He is the reality of the fatness of the Lord's house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Old Testament times, God's people could enjoy this fatness only in the place God had chosen for His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, the psalmist declares that God's people will be satisfied with the fatness of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse also says, "Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we enjoy the fatness in the house of God, we drink of the river of the Lord's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These pleasures are a river of joy to those who come to the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such pleasures come from the enjoyment of the fatness in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, in the Lord's house we are full of joy as we drink of the river of God's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 9 goes on to say, "For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these verses we have the fatness, the pleasures, the life, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We enjoy not only the river, but also the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This rich enjoyment is ours in the house of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the church we are satisfied with the riches of Christ, and we are full of pleasure and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is even a river of pleasures of which we may drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, we have the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life becomes the light in which we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our experience of all these aspects of Christ's riches becomes the genuine worship we render to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This worship is the basic element of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church life consists of worship that comes from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This enjoyment fills us with joy and pleasure, pleasure that even becomes a river of which we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we come to the fountain of life, and in the Lord's light we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here there is no darkness, death, weakness, or emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, we are satisfied and joyful as we drink of the Lord's pleasures and enjoy life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The worship produced by this enjoyment is the worship God desires today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This enjoyment and this worship constitute the proper, normal church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the Christian religion knows nothing of such worship, the Lord is recovering it in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOING WITH THE MULTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Psalm 42:4 the psalmist declares, "When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the psalmist recalls the enjoyment of going with the multitude to the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He remembered how they went to God's house with a voice of joy and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With a multitude, he kept the holy days, the days of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the psalmist uttered these words, he was in captivity, having lost the enjoyment related to the Lord's house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But as he remembered this enjoyment, he poured out his soul within him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse is a window through which we can see how the saints enjoyed the produce of the good land in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They went to the Lord's house with joy and praise, entering joyfully into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There in the Lord's presence they enjoyed the top portion of the produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In principle, this is our experience in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We come together with a multitude to enjoy Christ by keeping the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every time we come to the meetings of the church we keep the holy day by feasting on the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here in the Lord's house we truly enjoy Christ with God.</S>
