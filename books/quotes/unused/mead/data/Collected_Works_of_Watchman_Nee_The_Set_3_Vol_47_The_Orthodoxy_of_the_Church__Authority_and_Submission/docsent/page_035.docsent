   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us bring up another point.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Overcoming is spoken of in these epistles seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord speaks to Ephesus: Repent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Overcoming depends on the discovery of the slackening of first love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The overcoming of Smyrna is nothing but the Lord's words: "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Pergamos the Lord is against the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans; therefore, whoever rejects the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Thyatira there are still those who will not follow the teachings of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord says, "Hold fast until I come."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord does not ask them to rise to be a Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Sardis there are a few who are living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Sardis has nothing complete in herself, the Lord says that whoever is clothed in a white garment is the overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To Philadelphia, although she has trials and hardships, the Lord remarkably says to hold fast that which she has; she has already overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As for Laodicea, it is not enough to just have the objective side; she must walk with the Lord subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of the overcoming refers to the differences among the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The promises for overcoming are given to the churches; therefore, there are two kinds of people in the churches, the overcomers and the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The separating point is that God has a plan, a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whoever attains to the standard of God is an overcomer; whoever does not attain to the standard is not an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An overcomer merely does what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many have a wrong concept, thinking that overcoming means to be especially good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But remember, overcoming is the minimum degree; overcoming is not to rise above the level, but to come up to the level.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are able to attain to this standard, you are an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To fail means that you are not able to reach the plan of God and you fall below the level.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not know how you feel, but today there is one thing that makes me very happy: God did not cause me to be born during the age of Thyatira, a period of almost 1,400 years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God also did not cause me to be born in the age of Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are born in this age, the age of Philadelphia, which has existed just over a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord put us in the age of Philadelphia that we may be Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today there are many overcomers in Laodicea, but they are but overcomers in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the entire history of the church, there has not been an opportunity that is better than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore'' Rev 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must pay attention to the word "anymore,'' which means to have gone out at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among the brothers, eight out of ten have gone out before.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord's promise here is, I feel, very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a pillar in the temple of God goes out again, the temple will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The following three names are special: "The name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem,...and My new name."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the meaning of a name?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is great meaning in a name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The name of God represents the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Besides Philadelphia, no other church has received the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The name of the city of God is New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, Philadelphia accomplishes the plan of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"My new name."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven, He received a new name, a name that is above all names Phil 2:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the Lord reveals that of all the churches, He especially fixes His eyes on Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today we thank God; we were born in an age in which we can be Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we were born in an age in which the condition of the church is exceedingly confusing, thank God, we can be those of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Finally, please remember that the Lord speaks the same words seven times to the seven churches: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'' Rev 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to pay attention to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's eyes are not only upon these seven churches; His eyes are also upon all the churches in the whole world, past and present, here and abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What the Lord says, He says to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The slackening condition found in the time of Ephesus is quite likely to occur in today's Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the time of Smyrna has passed away, it is quite possible that it may occur again today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is often possible for the condition of every church to occur in one church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those special conditions are but the main conditions within a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is possible that all the conditions may occur in the seven churches at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.''</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Two people were walking on the street, and one said, "Just a moment, I hear the sound of crickets.''</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His friend replied, "You are crazy; the cars in the street are making so much noise, we can hardly hear ourselves talking!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How can you still hear the sound of crickets?''</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But he ran to the wall at the side of the street and told his friend to stand and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sure enough, there was a cricket.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His friend asked him how he could have possibly heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He replied, "Bankers can only hear the sound of money, and musicians can only hear the sound of music.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am an entomologist; my ear can hear the sound of insects.''</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord tells us that he who has an ear and can hear the Lord's word, let him hear.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are many who do not have ears and cannot hear the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we have an ear, we must hear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Pray that God will grant us to walk in a straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In any situation, no matter what happens, we must choose the way of Philadelphia.</S>
