<h2 class=head2>Not Only Coexisting but Also Coinhering with the Father</h2><p>The Son not only coexists with the Father, but also coinheres with the Father. What is the difference between coexisting and coinhering? To coexist is to exist together at the same time. To coinhere is to exist in one another, to dwell in one another. To say that the Father and the Son coexist means that they exist together. But to say that the Father and the Son coinhere means that they dwell in one another. We have a word concerning this coinherence in John 14:10a: “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?” Here we have the mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son. In John 14:11a the Lord goes on to say, “Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.” The Bible not only says that the Son and the Father are with each other; the Bible also reveals that the Son and the Father coinhere; that is, the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. John 17:21 is another verse that reveals this coinherence: “That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.”<p>It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence. The coexistence of the Son and the Father means that They exist together. The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son. Because of this coinherence of the Father and the Son, we may say that They are two-one.<h2 class=head2>The Son and the Father Being One Thus the Son Being the Father</h2><p>The Son and the Father are one. In John 10:30 the Lord Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one.” Because the Son and the Father are one, the Son is called the Father. According to Isaiah 9:6, the Son given to us is called the eternal Father. Thus, He is the Father.<p>A number of verses in the New Testament indicate that the Son and the Father are one. John 17:22 says, “And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.” In 1 John 2:25 the singular pronoun “He” is used to refer to both the Son and the Father: “And this is the promise which He promised us, the eternal life.” In this verse “He” refers to the Son and the Father spoken of in the preceding verse. This indicates that the Son and the Father are one. We see the same principle in 1 John 2:28: “And now, little children, abide in Him, that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.” In this verse the pronoun “He” refers definitely to Christ the Son, who is coming. Along with the preceding clause, “abide in Him,” which is a repetition of the clause in 1 John 2:27 involving the Trinity, indicates that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, inseparable from the Father or the Spirit. In 1 John 2:29 the personal pronoun “He” denotes the Triune God: “If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him.” “He” denotes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all-inclusively, because this pronoun refers to “He” and “Him” in the preceding verse, which denote the coming Son, and it also denotes “Him” in this verse, referring to the Father who has begotten us. This indicates strongly that the Son and the Father are one.<h2 class=head2>Living Because of the Father</h2><p>In John 6:57a the Lord Jesus says, “The living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father.” Here we see that the Son lives because of the Father. The Father is the cause of the Son’s living. Without the Father, the Son has no way to live. This verse is also a further indication that the Son and the Father are one.<h2 class=head2>Working with the Father</h2><p>The Son works with the Father. John 14:10b says, “The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.” Here we see that the Son speaks, and the Father works. The Son’s speaking is the Father’s working. In John 5 the Lord also reveals that He works with the Father. “My Father is working until now, and I am working” (v. 17). In verse 19 the Lord goes on to say, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner.”<h2 class=head2>Working in the Name of the Father</h2><p>The Son not only worked with the Father, but also worked in the Father’s name (John 10:25). This indicates that He worked as the Father, because He and the Father are one (10:30).
