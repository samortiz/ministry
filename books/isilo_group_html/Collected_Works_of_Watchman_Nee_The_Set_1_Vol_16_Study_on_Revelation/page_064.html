Revelation 17:13</H2><P>"These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast." </P><P>"These" refer to the ten kings. Some have said that the beast here refers to the Pope. This cannot be right, because no ten kings have ever given their power to the Pope. Some have said that the beast refers to one of the Roman emperors. But this is unreasonable too, because never have ten kings given their power to any one Roman emperor.</P><P>The ten kings give their power to the beast because they see the beast resurrecting from the dead and reckon that he is a superman and because they see the work of the evil spirits. After Christ died and resurrected, the Holy Spirit descended and formed the church. After Antichrist dies and resurrects, the evil spirits try to imitate such an operation, and they cause the ten kings to give their power to the beast.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Revelation 17:14</H2><P>"These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them." </P><P>According to the order of the record, we have this verse before verse 16. But according to the order of the facts, verse 16 occurs before verse 14. Revelation 19:11 is a detailed account of the war in 17:14. The actual war is recorded in Revelation 19:11-21. Although many follow the Lamb, the One who overcomes is the Lamb Himself. It is the sharp sword which comes out of the Lamb's mouth and the might of His feet that overcome the enemy and trample him under His feet. It is not His followers who overcome the enemy. The Lamb does not overcome the enemy through His power, but through His authority. He overcomes because He is the King of kings and Lord of lords. This speaks of authority, not of power.</P><P>There are three groups of people who accompany the Lamb: the called, the chosen, and the faithful. These three groups of people stand in opposition to the great harlot. Those who follow the Lamb must be called. To be called is based on God's own decision. Originally, the choosing came before the calling, but here, the calling comes before the choosing. Therefore, we see that this is a choosing from among the believers. The Lord says that many are called but few are chosen (Matt. 22:14), following the order in Revelation 17:14. Psalms 89:19 explains this. The Israelites had been chosen already, but God chose David from among the chosen Israelites. This shows that the saved ones belong to one group (all the called ones are saved), while the overcoming ones belong to another group (those who are after God's heart). Those who follow the Lamb are not only called and chosen, but also faithful. To be faithful is to not care for one's self, but to care for the Lord's mind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Revelation 17:15</H2><P>"And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlots sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues." </P><P>This verse explains the meaning of "waters." Since the harlot is a mystery, a sign, and is not interpreted literally, the waters should also be a mystery, a sign, and should not be interpreted literally. If we are satisfied with Christ, we will not be sitting on the waters. If we make the saints' fellowship an open fellowship with the world, we will be sitting on the waters.</P><P>This book tells us that the woman sits in three places:</P><P>(1) On the beast (17:3). This speaks of her union with the Roman Empire.</P><P>(2) On the seven hills (v. 9). This speaks of her taking Rome as the center.</P><P>(3) On the waters (v. 15). This speaks of her power reaching the whole world.</P><P>Why is she sometimes called "the harlot" and sometimes called "the woman"? The word "woman" refers to her relationship with Rome, while the word "harlot" refers to her relationship with Christ. Politically speaking, she is a woman, and religiously speaking, she is a harlot.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
