   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE WAY TO PROPERLY DEAL WITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18-20; Col 3:16-17; 2 Tim 3:15-17; Jude 20; John 15:7; 6:63 CRUCIAL VERSES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CONCERNING THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will look at some crucial verses in the New Testament concerning the Spirit and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 5:18-20 says, Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses say that we should praise and give thanks to God at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we give thanks to God in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, we praise and give thanks because we are filled in our spirit with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these verses, being filled in spirit is linked to praising and giving thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be filled in spirit with the Holy Spirit by praising God in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs and by giving thanks to God in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Colossians 3:16-17 says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses also say that we should praise and give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We praise with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we give thanks in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, there is a difference between this portion and Ephesians 5:18-20.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians says that our praising and giving of thanks are the result of our being filled in our spirit with the Holy Spirit, whereas Colossians says that our praising and giving of thanks are the result of our being filled richly with the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we compare these two portions of Scripture, we see that both speak of praising and giving thanks to God; of praising with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; and of giving thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the first part of both portions is different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians says that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit, whereas Colossians says that we should be filled with the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the result mentioned in both portions is the same praising and giving thanks; however, the cause is different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Ephesians the cause is our being filled with the Holy Spirit, and the result is that we praise and thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Colossians the cause is our being filled with the Lord s word, and the result is that we praise and thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One portion begins by saying that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit, and the other begins by saying that we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the results are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we can praise and give thanks, and when we let the word dwell in us richly, the result is also that we can praise and give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Timothy 3:15-17 says, From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All Scripture is the breathing out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jude 20 says, You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To build up ourselves upon our most holy faith is to read and understand the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most holy faith is the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must build up ourselves upon the most holy faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The verse continues, Praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this verse two matters are placed together: building up ourselves upon the most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 15:7 says, If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse speaks of the relationship between the Lord s word and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us, then we can ask whatever we will, and it shall be done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lastly, John 6:63 says, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this verse we see the relationship between the Lord s words and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The words that the Lord speaks to us are spirit and are life.</S>
