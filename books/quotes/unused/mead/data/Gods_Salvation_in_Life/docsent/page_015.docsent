   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. A Metabolic Process Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth step of transformation is a metabolic process Rom 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What the human body needs most is the circulation of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in the blood circulation, new elements and good elements must be added into the blood; otherwise, the blood circulation will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Chinese speak of taking care of the body, they mean eating better so that the blood may gain the nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the blood brings the new nutrients to the different parts of the body, and at the same time, it discharges the old elements from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's transformation in us is a metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we were to change ourselves, we would not have the new elements, and our change would be only an outward cosmetic change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the transformation which the Lord is carrying out in us is with the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we fellowship with the Lord, He supplies us within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This supply is a supply of new elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The spiritual blood circulation also discharges the old things from us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>E. Not Accomplished in an Instant</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The transformation within us by the Holy Spirit cannot be accomplished in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The metabolic transformation cannot be carried out in a hurry; rather, it is like taking Chinese medicine where the effect is gradual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>F. But Achieved Throughout Our Entire Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The transformation within us by the Holy Spirit is achieved throughout our entire life 2 Cor 4:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we contact the Lord daily, we receive the nutrients freshly supplied by His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we will be renewed and transformed in a continuing way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE WAY OF TRANSFORMATION A. By Fellowshipping with the Lord without Any Barrier with Unveiled Face Beholding and Reflecting Like a Mirror the Glorious Image of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to be transformed is first by fellowshipping with the Lord without any barrier, that is, with an unveiled face beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glorious image of the Lord 3:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Stanza 5 of Hymns, #501 reads, "In spirit while gazing on Thee, / As a glass reflecting Thy glory, / Like to Thyself transformed I'll be, / That Thou might be expressed thru me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be this way every day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a distinct difference between one who reads the Word for ten minutes and prays for five minutes in the morning and one who neither reads the Word nor prays.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every morning we must have fellowship with the Lord in this way, even if we are very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, during the day we also must find time to draw near to Him, to be face to face with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we will be like a mirror beholding Him and reflecting His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the Lord will transfuse into us the elements of what He is and what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the power of His life and with His life elements we shall gradually be metabolically transformed to have His life shape.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is most important is that through the renewing of our mind we shall gradually be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. The Advancing from One Degree of Glory to Another Degree of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, the way of transformation is by an increase and an advance, that is, advancing from one degree of glory to another degree of glory v. 18b . In the pathway of transformation, we proceed from one level of glory to another level of glory, from glory to glory, progressively.</S>
