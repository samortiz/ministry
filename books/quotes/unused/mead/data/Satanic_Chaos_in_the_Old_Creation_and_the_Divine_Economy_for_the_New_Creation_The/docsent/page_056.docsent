   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD ONE BY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND DOING ALL THINGS BECOMINGLY AND IN ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now that we have seen something concerning our standing as the church according to the divine revelation, we need to see the church life in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The unique God has a unique economy, and in this divine economy God produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 , the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is the expression, the manifestation, of the invisible Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is also God's house 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's house is not only His dwelling place but also His family, His folks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This house is also His kingdom, where He administrates and rules Matt 16:18-19; Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today's Christianity is full of organization, but the church as the living Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Revelation 3:1 the church in Sardis as a prefigure of the Protestant church has a name that she is living, but she is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Death is more defiling before God than sin Lev 11:24-25; Num 6:6-7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to be careful that we do not become like a corpse, with no life and no livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A local church should be living and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why I encourage all the saints to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees the right of free speech to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a sense, all the denominations take away the saints' first civil right because of their clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one is allowed to speak except the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we exercise our civil right to speak for the Lord, we should not exercise it in a wild way but in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 14:40 Paul says that in the church meetings, "all things must be done becomingly and in order."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am happy to see the young people among us excited and released, but their speaking when they are too excited can be like thunder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose that the heavens thundered all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one would be able to live in such an environment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is all right for the young people to make a joyful noise for a short period of time, but this should not be prolonged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we shout and speak, we must learn to shout and speak orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have to learn how to function in a proper way for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yes, we all can prophesy, but our prophesying in the meeting should not be disorderly because Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:31 that we can all prophesy "one by one."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not forget that it is "one by one," not three by five.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When someone is speaking in a meeting, we have to wait until he is finished before we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to keep the principle of "one by one."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church meetings, all things should be done becomingly and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are going to shout in a meeting, you have to learn how to shout becomingly and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even in an athletic contest, there are some rules which need to be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are going to be "crazy," excited, in the meetings, we have to be excited orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may think that when we are orderly, we cannot be excited and that when we are excited, we cannot be orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that there is the need of a proper order in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We Christians are not rioters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may be excited, but we are excited in an orderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When someone is prophesying, I should wait for him to finish before I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To keep the principle of speaking one by one is to be excited becomingly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes the young people may be too active and too noisy, whereas the older saints may be too retired.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the young people are functioning too much, the older saints should have the realization that it is now their turn to function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the church life, we need saints of all ages for the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When there is a blending of the functioning of the saints of all ages, this is "music."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the young people function in a very loud and excited way, this is not music.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With music there is a variation in sound, that is, in tone, rhythm, speed, and accent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the young people are functioning in an over-excited way, the older saints should then take the lead to say something for the Lord, to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then our meeting will be full of "music."</S>
