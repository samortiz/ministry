<h1 class="title">THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:1-12</h1>
<p>Bible readers acknowledge that the kingdom of the heavens is a major item in the Bible. God&rsquo;s greatest desire in the universe is to bring the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. While the Lord was on the earth, He worked to manifest His kingship and to establish His kingdom on the earth. Those who care for God&rsquo;s will must pay attention to the Lord&rsquo;s intention regarding the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In order to know the kingdom of the heavens, we must pay attention to the Gospel of Matthew, because Matthew specifically concerns the kingdom of the heavens. In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord gave three important teachings regarding three lines related to the kingdom of the heavens. The first line, in chapters 5 through 7, concerns the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The second line, in chapter 13, concerns the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The third line, in chapters 24 and 25, concerns the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In this book we will concentrate on the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Before considering the main subject, we must pay attention to some relevant points. Matthew 5 through 7 concerns the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Among Christians these chapters are commonly known as the Sermon on the Mount, because it was given on a mountain. Chapter 13 is on the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, and this chapter is commonly known as the Seaside Parables, because it was given by the seaside. Chapters 24 and 25 are concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and these chapters are commonly known as the Olivet Prophecy, because this speaking was given on the Mount of Olives. The location from which the Lord gave these three teachings is significant. The teachings concerning the reality and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens were given on a mountain. This means that we must go up the mountain and come forward to the Lord in order to hear and partake of them. Going up a mountain requires effort, and coming forward to the Lord is to draw near to the Lord. This indicates that those who pay the price and fellowship with the Lord can know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future. The word concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens was given beside the sea. The sea signifies the world corrupted and occupied by Satan. This means that although those in the world can hear the teaching concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, they cannot know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens or its manifestation.</p>
<p>If we read the Gospel of Matthew carefully, we will find other general teachings. Before the Lord spoke of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, He taught in the synagogues (4:23). His teaching in the synagogues was more general and was spoken to more people. In contrast, the words related to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens were spoken on a mountain to only a few people. Before the Lord spoke concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, He taught in the temple (21:23), and in this teaching He spoke of woes (23:13-29). However, those who followed the Lord to the Mount of Olives heard the Lord say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave...Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (25:21).</p>
<p>When the Lord spoke by the seaside concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, He did not give an interpretation (13:10-12). The speaking concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens was given by the seaside, but the interpretation of the mystery of the kingdom of the heavens was given inside the house (vv. 36-43). The mystery of the kingdom of the heavens is hidden. The people by the seaside can know only the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. In order to know the mystery of the kingdom of the heavens, a person has to leave the seaside and enter into the house in order to be with the Lord in a hidden way. These three contrasting teachings involve lower and higher elements.</p>
<p>The sequence of these three teachings is also significant. First, there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, then the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, and lastly the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The sequence reveals that unless a person lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, he cannot know the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens or the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Those who do not live in Matthew 5 through 7 cannot know chapter 13 or chapters 24 and 25. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is very important. We must first live in this reality before we can know the parables by the seaside and the prophecy given on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7 is on the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the living and principles of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. In seven sections the Lord explained the kingdom of the heavens. In particular, He explained the kind of living that the people of the kingdom of the heavens should have and the principles that they should keep. Therefore, the general subject of Matthew 5 through 7 is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is the living and the principles of the kingdom people.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
