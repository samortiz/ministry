   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous type we saw how a person chosen by God to inherit God s promised inheritance should be a burnt offering to God for the satisfaction of God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following that, we have another type, a type portraying Christ and the church, symbolized by the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. ISAAC TYPIFYING CHRIST A. Inheriting All That the Father Has</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaac as the son brought forth by Abraham through his wife Sarah became the unique seed to inherit all that his father had.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Abraham s old servant was securing a wife for Isaac, he testified that his master had given all that he had to his son Gen 24:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 25:5 also tells us that Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, Isaac became the one who inherited his father s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaac s inheriting of all that his father had is a type of Christ s inheriting all that God the Father has.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 3:35 says, The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, in John 16:15 the Lord said, All that the Father has is Mine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, Christ not only has received all that was given by the Father but has also inherited all that the Father has.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Obtaining the Church,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Which Is of the Same Blood and Flesh as He Is</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham sent his oldest servant, who ruled over all that he had, charging him to take a wife for Isaac not of the daughters of the Canaanites but of Abraham s kindred Gen 24:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, Isaac took Rebekah as his wife, who was of his father s house and of his kindred.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This typifies that Christ desires to obtain the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is, to be His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The counterpart of Christ must come from Christ s race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures, but from the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 2:14 says, Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through Christ s becoming a man of blood and flesh, the human race has become Christ s race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ s desire is to obtain the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is, to be His beloved counterpart for the satisfaction of His heart s intent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>REBEKAH TYPIFYING THE CHURCH A. Chosen and Prepared by God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as Isaac is a type of Christ, so Isaac s wife Rebekah is a type of Christ s counterpart, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rebekah was chosen to be Isaac s wife by the old servant whom Isaac s father, Abraham, sent to the place from where he was called out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rebekah never dreamed that she would be selected to be Isaac s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What happened to her altogether did not depend on her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It all depended on God s sovereign arrangement Gen 24:14 , for she was the one chosen and prepared by God to be given to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This typifies that the church is chosen and prepared by God to be given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 1:4 says, Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that before He created us, God chose us according to His infinite foresight to match Christ as His corporate bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Receiving the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>as a Seal and as a Pledge</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Rebekah had provided sufficient water for the camels, the old servant took a gold ring weighing half a shekel and put it on Rebekah s nose Gen 24:22, 47 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Half a shekel signifies the first taste, the foretaste, indicating that another half, the full taste, is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gold ring signifies the sealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a type of the church s receiving the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 1:13-14 says that in Christ we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Greek word for pledge also means foretaste, guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a pledge of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance.</S>
