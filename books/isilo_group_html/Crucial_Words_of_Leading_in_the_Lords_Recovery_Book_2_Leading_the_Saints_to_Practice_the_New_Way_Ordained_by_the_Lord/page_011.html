BUT BEING PATTERNS TO THEM</h2>
<p>On the negative side, an elder must not lord it over the saints (1 Pet. 5:3). In Greek, <em>to lord over</em> is to be someone&rsquo;s master. If an elder thinks that he is a kind of master, puts on airs, and lets people know that he is an elder and that everyone must listen to him, his eldership is utterly annulled. In the Bible the Lord taught that among us we have no masters except One (Matt. 20:26-27). This means that none can be a master over others. Among us, we are slaves to one another. Even the elders should be slaves to the brothers and sisters. We may be familiar with the saying that every ruler is a servant of the people. Even a president calls himself a servant of the people. When he meets with the common people, he should not put on the airs of a president. If he puts on the airs of a president, he is not a good president. A good president always feels that he is lower than the common people and that the common people are the true masters of the nation; he is but a public servant to these masters. This concept is undoubtedly influenced by the Bible.</p>
<p>In the church life, however, there are always some who misunderstand the meaning of the word <em>elder.</em> Consequently, they overly revere the elders. This is not proper. All of the elders must remember that they are not higher than the brothers and sisters; among us there is no such thing as the &ldquo;airs&rdquo; of an elder. It is said that in a certain locality, the brothers and sisters tremble when they knock on the door of the elders&rsquo; room; this is wrong. We should not create such an atmosphere for the elders. If there is such an atmosphere, even if the church has increased into many districts, it cannot be built up. Moreover, even if it is built up, the building up will not last. We all need to pay attention to this matter. </p>
<p>The elders, moreover, must be patterns to all the saints. First Peter 5:3b speaks of &ldquo;becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; For the elders to become patterns of the flock implies that elders are also sheep, except that they are the head sheep. As such, they need to be patterns. In New Zealand many flocks of sheep can be seen, and the wonderful thing about those sheep is that they all follow the sheep at the front, proceeding in two lines. The first two sheep are the head sheep. When the head sheep stop, the rest of the sheep also stop, when the head sheep turn right, all the sheep turn right, and when the head sheep turn left, all the sheep turn left. They do not need any command. The flock single-heartedly follows the head sheep. It is the same in the church life. The brothers and sisters simply follow the elders. If the head sheep, representing the elders, do not move forward but instead try to drive the sheep from the rear, the sheep will not know where to go. It is unreasonable and illogical for the head sheep to lead in this way.</p>
<p>If the elders would practice these points in taking the lead, teaching, rendering care, taking heed, shepherding the saints, and not lording it over them or putting on airs, the church will surely be strong and rich. If the elders take the lead in all things, whether visiting people, knocking on doors, preaching the gospel, having home meetings, having small group meetings, or having morning revival, sooner or later their pattern will spread and become a help to all the churches.</p>
<p>The living of the elders is a pattern. If the elders do not practice certain things, it will be difficult for the saints to practice them. For example, if the elders are not punctual in attending the meetings, it will not be easy for them to encourage the brothers and sisters to come to the meetings on time. In fact, this may leave the saints with the impression that the elders exercise special privileges to come to the meetings whenever they want, while expecting the saints to come early. This will cause resentment in the saints&rsquo; spirits. Hence, all the elders must set an example by their own actions. This kind of leading is the best. When the saints recognize the elders as the head sheep, they will simply follow the elders however the elders lead them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
