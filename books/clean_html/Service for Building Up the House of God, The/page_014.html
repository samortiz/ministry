<h1 class="title">DANGERS TO AVOID IN THE SERVICE</h1>

<p>In this chapter and the next chapter, we will fellowship concerning the dangers we may encounter in our testimony, our service, and our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGINAL CONDITION AND<br />
THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church is a living organism, not a dead organization. In the New Testament, especially in the Acts of the Apostles, the church was a living organism. At that time the believers took the ascended Christ as their Head and were under His authority. They were ruled and led by the Spirit. They lived, moved, and worked in and by the Spirit. The human will, the letter, and regulations are not expressed in Acts, nor is there a system or an organization. This is the proper condition that God desires the church to have on the earth. The church is the living Body of Christ, the Son of God. All the believers in the Body of Christ are joined mutually to one another by the divine life and by the Spirit; hence, there is nothing of the human will, of the letter, or of regulation. This is the normal condition of the church.</p>
<p>The church did not remain in its proper condition for long. Both the Bible and church history reveal that the spiritual and heavenly condition of the church did not last very long. The church fell gradually into regulations, became an organization, and lost the experience of the divine life, its spiritual nature, and its heavenly position. When the Roman Catholic Church was formed, the spiritual and heavenly things and the divine life were lost. Later, Martin Luther rose up to reform the church. Even after the many reformations in church history, Christianity is still a system and an organization with regulations. Furthermore, the many worldly things that were brought into the church caused the church to lose her function as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The church lost her function because she lost her nature, position, and content. The nature of the church should be spiritual, her position should be heavenly, and her content should be the divine life. Christianity is an organization instead of being spiritual, it is of the earth instead of being heavenly, and it is human instead of being divine. As a result, the church has lost her function as the Body and cannot supply the life of Christ to people, express Christ on earth, or rule on the earth for God. Although there are believers in Christianity who proclaim the pure gospel and spread the truths of the Bible, the general condition of Christianity is organizational, worldly, and human.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE AND POSITION</h2>
<p>If our intention is to criticize others, we have failed. However, it is necessary to speak these things so that we may be enlightened to know the present condition of the church. If we intend to serve the Lord in this age, we must have a vision of the Body of Christ, and we must be clear about the situation of Christianity. Without a vision of the Body of Christ and an understanding of the situation in Christianity, our service will lack life and light with which to supply others; in other words, we will grope in the dark. If we want God to flow through us, we must see the church and understand the present condition of Christianity. Then He will guide us concerning the way that we should take.</p>
<p>What we practice in the meetings must be according to our vision of the Body of Christ and the present situation in Christianity. We do not intend to become another sect or another denomination. We must understand that the church is heavenly and spiritual. We are not a denomination, and we are not an earthly or human organization.</p>
<p>Other believers may call us a denomination or a sect, but we should be clear that we are neither a denomination nor a sect. We do not intend to establish denominations. That would be degradation.</p>
<p>We do not want an organization, a system, regulations, or anything worldly. We want to live in the life of God and to be ruled by the Spirit in order that we may be God&rsquo;s testimony on this earth in every locality. Apart from this desire, we are nothing. We do not have a system, and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we want to take this way and be His testimony. We are a group of believers who walk together and testify for God. If others are not willing to take this way, we should not criticize or judge them, nor should we discriminate against them. Although we have mutual fellowship with believers who have seen the light that we have seen, this is not a matter of intimacy. And although it is difficult for us to have mutual fellowship with believers who have not seen the light that we have received, this is not a matter of discrimination. We can humbly receive spiritual help from all God&rsquo;s children, for it is a supply from the Head of the Body. When we are received by other believers, we should help them, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, according to His leading. This should be not only our view but also our practice.</p>
<p>Many believers criticize us, saying that we are closed. This is the main accusation overseas. Some people in Christianity say that I exert too much control and that I am a closed person. Some brothers have asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, why do you not speak to other believers, and why do you not invite other believers to speak to us? Does this not mean that you are closed?&rdquo; We need to ask ourselves whether we are indeed closed and to ask what our reasons are for not inviting other believers. When other believers ask me the first question, I sometimes say, &ldquo;I would go and speak to other believers, but I have not been invited. Many are concerned that I would steal their sheep. If they would open the door for me to speak, I would speak from morning to evening. Who is being closed?&rdquo; As to why we do not invite the others to speak, let me ask, &ldquo;What will they speak about?&rdquo; If their content indeed will feed the flock, let them speak. I say this from the bottom of my heart; we are always willing to walk together with God&rsquo;s children. If we do not walk together, it is because we have been forced into this situation and have no alternative.</p>
