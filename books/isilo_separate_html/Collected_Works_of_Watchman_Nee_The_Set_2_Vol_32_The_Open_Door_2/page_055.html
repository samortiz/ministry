O. Box 323, Shanghai, November 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">A CHALLENGE FROM THE BORDER REGIONS</h2><p>In view of the drastic changes in the world situation, some of the co-workers have had a deep realization of the imminent coming of the Lord. They have given themselves selflessly to the obedience of the Lord's commission in spreading the gospel to the far border regions, such as the provinces in Yunnan, Sikang, and Tibet. These places are now imprinted with the beautiful footsteps of the gospel preachers and the announcers of the glad tidings. The gospel messengers in the remote border regions have received special gifts, a special commission, and a special leading from the Lord. They are not deterred in any way. They are ever charging forward. They have won the admiration of all believers throughout the nation. We, who are confined to our homes and unable to follow their fine footsteps to faraway countries because of circumstances and the lack of being equipped, are undoubtedly ashamed. But there are two ways to interpret the meaning of the words remote borders. We can say that the border regions of our nation are the great border regions. But we can also say that the edge of our cities and villages, regions where the gospel has not yet reached, are smaller border regions. Although we cannot go to the greater border regions, we can go to the smaller border regions. In fact, there are urgent cries from these smaller border regions and numerous opportunities. For example, although there is a church in the county-town of Fu-Ting, there are a hundred households and over ten thousand people outside the town who have never heard the real gospel. Even though a few people have believed in the gospel in Shuen-Cheng, which is about thirty miles from Fu-Ting, they are very isolated. We need workers for the follow-up work. Although churches can be seen everywhere within Jin-Shiang in Jiang-Nan, many villages outside the east and west gates of the city are void of believers. Some have never even seen a gospel preacher pass by their place. We owe them very much, and our debt is heavy. The Lord is coming. When are we going to repay this debt? Although the gospel has spread to Shan-Men in Bei-Gang, the town of Yuen-Pan, which is only ten miles from Shan-Men, has no knowledge of the church in Shan-Men. Some have not even heard the name of Jesus yet. These places are very desolate. Not only are they in desolation, but many other places are also desolate. During this period of crisis, sudden deaths can be seen everywhere in the cities and the countryside. Furthermore, the spread of epidemics has taken the lives of many healthy men and women. Their bodies have died, yet their souls have not heard the gospel; they are destined for perdition. Whose responsibility is it? In consideration of this, the brothers in Hu-Shan have banded themselves to preach the gospel in Chao-Yang-Shan and have gained many souls. Why would the brothers and sisters everywhere not rise up and do the same?</p><p>Chen</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD FROM THE EDITOR</h2><p>The preceding article was published in the fifth issue of Local News of the Churches of God in Border Regions between Chekiang and Fukien. We intended to quote this in the last issue, but there was not enough time. We have published it in this issue. One fact is difficult for me to point out: In Issue No. 1 of this magazine, Brother Watchman Nee said, "During this time, the apostles should spend more time to labor in the inland regions." We thank the Lord that since then many brothers have turned to the inland provinces. We thank the Lord also that many brothers and sisters are becoming burdened for the work in the remote border regions. But from my understanding, during the past year, much attention, consecration, zeal, and concern have been given to the remote border regions, and the inland regions have been neglected. Some even think that the "border provinces" are the "border regions." I myself could not differentiate between the two either at the beginning. There has also been misunderstanding concerning the words remote and inland regions. I would, therefore, like to say something based on what I know.</p><p>"Border provinces" are those provinces such as Yunnan, Sikang, Tibet, and Sinkiang, which touch the national borders, excluding those by the sea. However, the provincial capitals and some regions of the border provinces are not "border regions." For example, although some counties in Yunnan are within the general boundary of the border provinces, their actual condition is the same as some of the counties in Kiangsu and Chekiang, and they are as prosperous. For example, the region between Yunnan and Sikang is truly a border region. But the area between Sikang and Szechuan, such as Kang-Ting, cannot be considered a border region.</p><p>Concerning what is considered "remote" or "desolate," there are two kinds of places. One kind of place is where the people live very poorly and their livelihood is bleak. The other is where people are living in sin and have never heard the gospel (such as those mentioned in Brother Chen's letter above). Any place that fits the above two descriptions is a "desolate border region" if it is situated in a border province, and a "desolate poverty-striken region" if it is situated in any province that is not at the border.</p><p>There are also two kinds of "inland regions." The two kinds are the provinces which are more inland from the sea and the counties and municipalities which are geographically situated toward the inland. Among the provinces which are "inland," some counties and municipalities are not that poor or sparsely populated (such as some of the bigger counties and municipalities in Yunnan and Kweichow). Some are even quite rich (such as the many counties and municipalities in Szechuan). We can say that some of these places (like Chungking and K'un-ming) even resemble big cities. In contrast, some counties and municipalities in provinces in north and central China and even some provinces bordered by the sea, are still quite poor. Therefore, I hope that in the many prayers and offerings, the work and the workers in every place will not be forgotten, especially the workers who are working in the "desolate regions."</p><p>I must also say a few words to the co-workers who have been called to work in the "desolate regions." We must not think that by going to inland provinces, we have reached the "remote regions" or "desolate regions." Nor should we remain in one place, thinking that we will move on only after we have built up the church to a certain degree. (Of course, if some have special burdens, as Paul did in Corinth and Ephesus, it is a different story.) There are so many "desolate regions" in the inland provinces outside the larger cities. If we stay in one place, how can the other places expect to see men visiting them? This summer I was in a mountain village in Wan County, which is only twenty miles from the city. No one has come to preach the gospel to the village folks there yet. Recently, a few co-workers and I traveled by bus from Chungking to Kuei-yang. What we saw along the way was enough to break our hearts! Some coolies are overloaded with heavy burdens, shuttling back and forth on mountain pathways. What they earn in a day is enough only to fill their stomach. What hope do they have in this life? How much these people need the gospel preached to them! But in order to preach the gospel to these coolies, we must first sit down and count the cost. Are we willing to suffer psychologically and physically? In some places, one cannot buy things even if he has the money. Some bigger roads have inns along the way. But some smaller pathways are very foreboding! It is not an easy thing for us to advance into these villages one by one. Yet such labor in the Lord will not be in vain. When I was in Kuei-yang, I heard that a certain Westerner who works among the Miao tribes has become so blended in with them that he eats and sleeps with them on the floor. He eats (not on purpose) the same fly-infested food that they eat. As a result he gains souls among them. I am not one who has been commissioned by the Lord to preach the gospel everywhere, but I know a little of the hardships involved. I say this with sighing tears and hopeful sincerity. I hope that the co-workers will forgive me for saying this!</p><p>Ruth Lee, in Kuei-yang, October 17</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
