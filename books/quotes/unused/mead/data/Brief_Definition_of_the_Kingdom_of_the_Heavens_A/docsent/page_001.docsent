   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The contents of this book are messages that were given in the summer of 1963 in Altadena, California.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These messages were among the first that were released by Brother Witness Lee after having been led by the Lord to begin the work of the Lord s ministry in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those of us who were privileged to hear these messages at that time, either by attending the meetings or listening to them on audio tapes, can testify of the deep and lasting impression that the Lord gave to us concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most of the ones who heard these messages had been saved for many years, yet as the Word was opened, almost everything spoken was new light to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matter of the kingdom is a great and crucial truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For God to accomplish His divine purpose, He needs His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The government of God is with His kingdom, and in His kingdom He fully exercises His divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every believer should live a life that is under this heavenly rule.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to our salvation, there is the exercise and responsibility of the kingdom of the heavens in this age, and those who live in its reality today Matt 5 7 will participate in its manifestation in the coming age as a reward Matt 24 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord will judge His believers at His coming back according to their living and work after being saved 2 Cor 5:10 , and will either reward them or discipline them Matt 24:40 25:30; Luke 12:35-48; 1 Cor 3:10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We hope that this book will be read with much prayer and that its contents will encourage us to run the race with endurance 1 Cor 9:24-27; Heb 12:1 , to pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Phil 3:12-14 , looking to the Lord to save us unto His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18 that we might be awarded the crown of righteousness in that day 2 Tim 4:8 , the day of Christ s second appearing when He will reward each man according to his doings Matt 16:27 and his work Rev22:12 .</S>
