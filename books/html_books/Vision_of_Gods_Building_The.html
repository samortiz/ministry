Scripture opens with God&#8217;s creation and finishes with His building. God&#8217;s creation is for His building, and God&#8217;s building is the ultimate consummation which fulfills His purpose in creation. The principal means for accomplishing God&#8217;s creation is His divine power. But the main element utilized for God&#8217;s building is the divine life. We were born into God&#8217;s creation, but we are reborn for God&#8217;s building, which is the church, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. This building is of life, by life, and with life. Regeneration in life is the beginning, growth in life is the continuation, and maturity in life is the consummation of life for this building of God. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, God&#8217;s ultimate building, there is a river of life flowing for those who participate in God&#8217;s building to drink, and the tree of life growing in the river of life for them to eat. These signify that the building of God is produced, nourished and sustained by God Himself and with God Himself in Christ as life to us. Hence, for us to partake of God&#8217;s building, there is no other way but by life and with life.<br><br>Life and building are the two key words in the entire Bible. Life is God in Christ as the living content, and building is the corporate expression of the Triune God. What a pity that both life and building are almost altogether neglected by today&#8217;s Christianity! For the proper church life, both must be fully recovered. In recent years the Lord has begun this recovery in the U.S.A. We have full assurance that He will swiftly accomplish it to the uttermost for the fulfillment of His purpose.<br><br>The following chapters are messages given in the winter conference of 1964 at Los Angeles. They are maintained in the simple spoken form. May the Lord use them for the building up of His seeking ones.<br><br>Witness Lee</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION</h1><h2 class=head1>A LINE IN THE SCRIPTURE</h2><p>From the beginning of Scripture to the very end there is a definite line of God&#8217;s building. Among the many items of His creation recorded in Genesis one and two, God mentions three precious substances: gold, bdellium (pearl) and onyx stone. Why are these items mentioned at the very beginning, and what are they for? The answer is revealed at the end of Scripture. In Revelation twenty-one and twenty-two there is a building, a city, called the New Jerusalem. This city is composed of gold, pearl and precious stones. The precious substances mentioned in Genesis are the materials for the building portrayed in Revelation! At the beginning of Genesis we see the materials, and at the end of Revelation we see the New Jerusalem, composed of these materials.<p>Then we may ask, what does the portion of Scripture between Genesis and Revelation deal with? If we read carefully, we will see the line of God&#8217;s building from Genesis to Revelation. But we can also see some building work which is not of God. The whole Scripture is a record of building!<p>Immediately after the fall of man, mentioned in Genesis three, we read of the city of Enoch, built by the fallen sons of Adam. Later, another city named Babel was erected, along with a high tower. Then the city of Sodom was built. But in contrast to these cities, God mentions some men living in tents. Noah lived in a tent opposite the city of Enoch. And later, Abraham lived in a tent opposite the cities of Babel and Sodom.<p>Genesis also relates the story of Jacob, a man who had a wonderful dream one night. When he awoke he set up the stone which he had used for a pillow and poured oil upon it, saying, &#8220;This is the House of God.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s building! A stone will be the House of God.<p>The Book of Exodus relates how Jacob&#8217;s descendants, the people of Israel, were taken captive in Egypt. As slaves of Pharaoh they worked laboriously to build two cities for him. But instead of using building materials of gold, pearl, and precious stones, they used mud. They used something of the earth. Bricks were made from mud hardened by the heat obtained from burning straw. Pharaoh&#8217;s two cities were made of earthly things.<p>God eventually delivered the Israelites out of Egypt and took them to Mount Sinai in the wilderness. There He asked them to build Him a tabernacle. If we could have looked into the tabernacle and observed the priest worshipping in the holiest place, we would have seen him clothed with a breastplate and two shoulder plates full of precious stones. Surrounding the priest was a scene of gold! There was not any hay, straw, or mud bricks in that building; just gold and precious stones. We need to remember also that the tabernacle was the very center of the people of Israel during their history of wandering in the wilderness.<p>When they entered the good land of Canaan, the essential work of the Israelites was the construction of a temple- another building. But, before they could erect this structure, they had to defeat and drive out all their enemies. They had to gain the ground, the site for the building. On that cleared ground they built the temple, which became the center of the history of Israel.<p>Years later, after the enemy defeated Israel and took the land, the temple was immediately destroyed. The enemy destroyed their center. But after seventy years of captivity there was a recovery, a rebuilding of the city and the temple. The main item of the recovery was building-the building of the city and the temple. This brings to a close the history of the Old Testament.<p>The first outstanding event of the New Testament was the incarnation of Christ in human form. The Gospel of John relates, in the American Standard Version, that the Lord Jesus &#8220;tabernacled among us&#8221; (John 1:14, margin). God Himself was incarnated as the tabernacle, the building! The Lord Jesus was the building portrayed in the four Gospels.<p>The enemy, Satan, utilized the Jewish people to destroy this building by putting Jesus to death on the cross. But the Lord had already told the Jews: &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in  three days I will raise it up&#8221; (John 2:19). This means the Lord raised up His destroyed body in resurrection and by resurrection. This includes His mystic Body, the Church.<p>In the Epistles we are told the Church is the House of God, the Temple of God. So the Church is the very building of God. Then, praise the Lord, at the end of Scripture there is nothing but a building, a city, the completion of God&#8217;s building work throughout the generations. In this holy city, the New Jerusalem, there are the names of the twelve tribes of the Old Testament, and the names of the twelve apostles of the New Testament. These two groups represent all the redeemed people of God. This means the New Jerusalem is a composition of all the redeemed ones. But this is not all; in the New Jerusalem, God and man are completely mingled as one building. That is, divinity is mingled with humanity. God is the content and man is the vessel; God is the life and man is the expression of that life. This is the ultimate building of God.<p>We have now briefly covered the entire Bible. Do you see the line, the vision of God&#8217;s building, throughout the Scripture? Remember, at the beginning there were the materials, but at the end there is the finished building composed of these materials. In between are the accounts of the building procedure, and, of course, many inserted stories. Briefly, these interesting insertions are the numerous accounts of the serpent, Satan, who crept in soon after the materials were mentioned in Genesis 2. But after the serpent appeared, God immediately foretold that the Seed of woman, Christ, would bruise that serpent (Gen. 3:15). The serpent brought in sin and death, but Christ brought in righteousness and life (Rom. 5). Christ Himself destroyed the devil. Eventually the serpent is chased away, cast out by Christ into the bottomless pit and the lake of fire (Rev. 20). That is the end of the insertions. But the building of God stands completed! This sums up a brief sketch of the Scripture, which is the record of God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE VISION ON THE HIGH MOUNTAIN</h2><p>I must point out now that this vision of God&#8217;s building is revealed only from the high mountain top. If we are still on a low plain, our eyes will be veiled. We must be carried away to a high mountain in order to see things clearly and thoroughly. In Revelation the Apostle John was carried away in spirit to a mountain great and high (Rev. 21:10). From this place he was shown the New Jerusalem, God&#8217;s ultimate building. This city was coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal. In Revelation 4, the appearance of God sitting on the throne was also like jasper stone. Therefore, this city is the same as God&#8217;s appearance! John was acquainted with a temple in ancient Jerusalem, but he did not see a temple in this new city, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are the temple thereof. Neither did this city need sun or moon, for the glory of God lightened it, and the Lamb was the lamp thereof. God is the light in Christ, the Lamp. John also saw in the center of the city a clear river proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. These details are very meaningful and can only be seen from a high mountain.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION IN HIS CREATION</h2><p>The main purpose of this chapter is that we may see what is revealed from the beginning of God&#8217;s work of creation. Strictly speaking, we are not dealing with God&#8217;s creation as such, but His intention in creation. I believe all Christians know the creation story. Many of us as youngsters were taught this subject in Sunday School. We know what God made on the first day, the second day, and so on; but have we realized God&#8217;s aim and goal in His creation?<p>Here is the picture in Genesis 1: God created heaven and earth. Then, in a sense, the earth was damaged; so it was buried in deep waters. There was a waste and void, darkness, deep water, and no life. Then God performed three kinds of separation. On the first day, He divided the light from the darkness. Then God separated the waters above from the waters beneath the firmament. And finally, He divided the land from the water. Out of this separated or resurrected land, God brought forth an abundance and variety of life. There was life of the lowest form and without consciousness, the vegetable life; then, there was life of the higher form, the animal life. Finally, man was brought forth as the apex of God&#8217;s creation. In Genesis 1, God said: &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them; and God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply; and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth&#8221; (Genesis 1:26-28).<h2 class=head1>FOUR KEY WORDS</h2><p>Please note carefully four key words from Genesis 1: man, image, dominion and earth. Image and dominion are very meaningful. Both are vitally related to man, the center of God&#8217;s creation. It is God&#8217;s intention that man have dominion over all the earth, not just over the living creatures of this earth. God commanded man to replenish or fill the earth; and He also told man to subdue the earth. Subdue is a strong, significant word. It indicates that there is something of rebellion on this earth which must be subdued. Man is to have dominion over everything that moves or creeps upon this earth. Man was made in the image of God and committed with the dominion of God to rule over this earth.<p>Only a few have paid much attention to the fourth key word, the earth. It is a little word, much neglected by Christians today. So many dream and talk about a wonderful place called &#8220;heaven.&#8221; However, God&#8217;s desire is this earth. Man is to be fruitful and multiply, to fill the earth, and subdue it. If we could apprehend the real meaning of these four words-man, image, dominion, and earth-I believe we would understand the entire Scripture!<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S DESIRE</h2><p>All good Bible students agree that the eighth Psalm is a continuation of Genesis 1. Notice, the Psalmist did not begin this Psalm by declaring, &#8220;O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the heavens...&#8221; No, he did not stress the heavens. Rather, he said, &#8220;How excellent is Thy name in all the earth.&#8221; I believe the Psalmist was meditating during the night when he wrote this Psalm. Being human, as we are, he considered God&#8217;s heavens, the moon and the stars. As he beheld the heavens, however, he did not exclaim, &#8220;What is an angel that Thou art mindful of him.&#8221; No, he asked, &#8220;What is man...&#8221; I do not understand this wonderful reasoning. The Psalmist was considering the heavens, yet he quickly reverted to man and to God&#8217;s care for man on this earth. I point out these verses only to illustrate that in the thought of the Psalmist there was perhaps a place for angels, but in the divine concept, man&#8217;s position was much more important. And to God, earth is much more important than heaven. At the end of this Psalm, God is again praised for the excellence of His name in all the earth.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S EXPRESSION AND REPRESENTATION</h2><p>Heaven and earth are the realm and sphere of God&#8217;s creation, with so many created things as the environment. But the earth, with man as the center, is God&#8217;s primary concern. Why does God need man as the center of His creation? Because man is the expression and the authority of God. If we are acquainted with all Scripture, we will clearly see that God&#8217;s deep desire is to be expressed, and, even more, to be represented through man upon this earth. God exists in this universe, but who has seen Him? God&#8217;s deep desire is to be expressed, not through or by Himself, but through man. The New Testament uncovers this great mystery: God manifested Himself in flesh, in a man. We know God is real, yet no man had ever seen Him. However, He has now been expressed through humanity. God is constantly desirous of expressing Himself, using man as His vessel and representative on this earth.<p>God never ordained anything else to be His representative, holding His authority. Out of the multimillion items of His creation, God ordained only man to be His representative on this earth. This is why man was expressly made in God&#8217;s image and committed with God&#8217;s authority.<p>If you bear God&#8217;s image, then you express God. You are a photo, a reproduction of God. Man exists for one purpose, that is to express God. But such an expression is only possible when we actually resemble God. When we acquire God&#8217;s likeness, we will then express Him and have His authority and dominion. This is God&#8217;s intention for us. Later, we will define God&#8217;s purpose in being expressed through man and represented by man. Our present aim is to clearly point out that God&#8217;s intention in creation is to have man as His expression.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S CONCEPT OF BUILDING IN THE CREATION OF MAN</h2><p>The thought of building is in Genesis one. God said, &#8220;Let us make man in our image, and let them have dominion...&#8221; God first mentions &#8220;man&#8221; in the singular number, but follows with the plural pronoun, &#8220;them.&#8221; Did God then create one man, or many men at that time? The answer is, when God created man He did not create a small individual, but a collective man, including you! God created you and the entire human race in Adam. So, the man God created is collectively singular.<p>The &#8220;old man,&#8221; Adam, failed God. So He had to create another man, a new man in Christ. The question arises again, is this new man one person or many persons? Again, we must answer, the new man is also one! Thus, from God&#8217;s viewpoint, there are only two men in this universe: the old man and the new man. All in Adam belong to that old man, and everyone who is in Christ belongs to the new man. The New Testament says that Christ created in Himself one new man out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles (Eph. 2:15). We are further told that this one new man is the Body of Christ (Eph. 2:16). So this new man is a collective man.<p>Are Christians then one or many? First Corinthians 10:17 says that we are many, yet we are one bread, one Body. We are many, yet we are one, collectively one; and we must be built up as one.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S CORPORATE EXPRESSION</h2><p>God has only one image, and since His image is one, He can only have one expression. There are many thousands of Christians on this earth. How then can so many be just one expression of God? The answer is in God&#8217;s building! We must have the building. I do not have words to express what is on my heart concerning this matter. There is a vision open to me continuously day and night. First, negatively, it is impossible for any single individual to express God in a full way; then, positively, the proper and adequate expression of God must be a coordinated, corporate expression. Remember, God&#8217;s desire and purpose is that He be expressed and represented through man on this earth. But this is possible only when we are being mutually coordinated and built up together. Then God will be fully expressed. Oh, we must be built up with other Christians as a corporate expression, representing God! God&#8217;s first created man failed to be His one expression, but the principle still holds: the other man created by God-the new man-is to be that all-inclusive, corporate man, God&#8217;s real expression on this earth.<p>Let us be more practical. Christians talk much about being like Jesus, glorifying God, and expressing Christ. But it is impossible for any individual to glorify God or express Christ in a full way if he is not built up with other Christians. Consider ourselves. All of our problems are due to one thing: we are too independent and individualistic; we are disconnected and isolated from others. So we are beset with failures and weaknesses. Do you have a certain besetting sin which you cannot overcome? You will never surmount it or overcome it by yourself. You must forget your own efforts and pay full attention to being built up with others. If we are willing to be vitally related and built up with others, we will find that our weaknesses and shortcomings will disappear. We must learn to pay attention to one thing: being built up with other Christians. In the early years of my Christian life I did not see this building principle. I was struggling and striving, seeking and fighting. One day the Lord opened my eyes. I saw that there was no need for me to struggle, fight and toil any longer. I need only abide in the Body. As long as each member of my physical body abides in the body, everything is all right.<p>Suppose your hand is isolated and separated from your body; yet it continues with great effort to live and function, to be healthy and useful! Suppose someone should ask the severed hand, &#8220;What are you striving for...?&#8221; and it replies, &#8220;Oh, I must strive to be healthy, to overcome all the germs, etc., etc.&#8221; Such a supposition is absurd in the extreme. Yet this is the case of most Christians today, probably including yourself. Yes, we are Christians, but we are not actually related to one another. We are members of Christ&#8217;s Body, but we are not fitly framed together. We are materials, but we are not built up together as God&#8217;s building. Oh, we must forget our personal struggles and just abide in the Body! A misplaced, detached hand is not only useless-it is ugly and terrifying! Let us forget our striving and just pay attention to being vitally related to Christ&#8217;s Body. Then the germs will be killed, and we will be living and powerful, healthy and functioning. We will not merely be useful, but fully useful.<p>Soon after I became a Christian, I read numerous articles concerning the victorious life and how to overcome sin. I tried to apply what I learned; yet the more I tried, the more I failed! I became very disappointed. But one day the Lord opened my eyes to see that Christ is within me as my life, that I am a member of His Body, and that there is no need for me to do anything. Then I deeply appreciated that Christ was my life, and that I was in the Body. From this realization I experienced victory continually. There was no need to strive. The whole Body enriched me and strengthened me. I realized I was a member of the new man.<p>At the end of Scripture, as its conclusion, there is one city. And this city is the building, the unique, universal expression of God. God always has only one expression. As in Genesis 1, there is only one man, so at the end of Scripture there is only one city, built of gold, pearls and precious stones. An independent Christian can never be a real, full expression of God. If we cut off our ear, it is an expression only of death. If I come upon a heap of ears, I will be terrified. Yet there are so many Christians today just like this, frightening people away. They are &#8220;nice&#8221; Christians, but practically speaking they are separated and isolated from the Body.<p>As Christians, can we point out other definite members of the Body of Christ with whom we are related in a practical way? This is not a matter of doctrine or ethereal &#8220;spirituality&#8221;; it is a matter of practical reality. Check yourself. If you are an isolated member of the Body, you are burdened with many problems. The only way to be a victorious Christian is to be a related Christian. When we come to the Body, we find that all the besetting sins are under our feet! The issue is not whether we are a living, healthy, or functioning, individual Christian; but are we vitally and practically related to the Body of Christ? It is a pity, but it is a fact that very little is heard today regarding the building of God and the real relatedness of the Body of Christ on this earth. I do hope that we all may see that it is God&#8217;s intention to have a corporate man as a building, a unique expression, with so many members fitly framed together, members related and built up as one Body. Then, wherever we are, we will enjoy all the riches of the Body.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION REGARDING THE EARTH</h2><p>Now let us consider the fourth key word which is mentioned in Genesis 1-earth. Why must God overrule and subdue the earth? Because on the earth is God&#8217;s enemy, Satan, the rebellious one. This enemy was in the serpent, the head of creeping things. God must defeat His enemy and subdue the rebellious earth in order to recover it for Himself.<p>Christians today, including many spiritual leaders, have a wrong concept. They say, &#8220;Let us not talk about the problem of the church. When we get to heaven we will be one...&#8221; But if we must wait until we are in heaven to realize oneness, if we cannot have oneness on this earth, this is a shame to God and a glory to Satan! Satan will gleefully clap his hands and say, &#8220;Look, look at all of these defeated Christians. They are just waiting to go to heaven. There isn&#8217;t any place for them on earth.&#8221; What a shame to God! In Matthew 6, the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father&#8217;s will be done on earth as it is in heaven. As far as God is concerned, there is no problem in heaven, but there is a real problem on this earth. God has to deal with this rebellious earth. All Christians must declare the victory now; they must give present testimony on this earth that they are one. The Church must be locally expressed on this earth. If the Church is only heavenly, then God is in disgrace. The Church expressed locally on this earth, however, is a real disgrace to Satan and glory to God. Whenever a group of saints come together, testifying that they are one in Christ, God&#8217;s enemy is put to shame. When God has such a building on this earth, victory is declared. But regardless of the situation, we know that God can never be defeated by Satan.<p>You may want to go to heaven and see a heavenly church life, but God is waiting and expecting to come down to this earth! In Revelation 21, the Holy Spirit tells us that the Apostle John saw a new heaven and a new earth. Many Christians are disgusted with this earth. They are hoping that some day they will be in heaven and the earth will have vanished away. But John saw not only a new heaven, he also beheld a new earth. We may not like the earth, but God does. God is going to recover this earth.<p>John also saw a vision of the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. However, he did not see the New Jerusalem going up to heaven from this earth. This perhaps is what most Christians read into this verse in Revelation. No! John saw the one and only expression of God, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven as a testimony to the whole earth. I believe the eighth Psalm will be completely fulfilled at that time; and you and I will say, &#8220;O Lord, how excellent is Thy Name in all the earth!&#8221; Satan will then be put to shame and the earth will be completely subdued and fully recovered.<p>Today we can have a foretaste of that glorious coming day. Oh, we must not be defeated by the wrong concept that it is impossible to have the church life on this earth and that we must wait for heaven. We must cast these negative thoughts beneath our feet and boldly declare that the Church must be expressed on this earth today.<h2 class=head1>A SUMMARY</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention then in creation is to have a corporate man in His image to express Himself, and this man is to be committed with His authority, using His dominion to subdue and recover the earth. Yet, as long as Christians are divided, there is no possibility of recovering this earth for God. What a shame that Christians are so divided! As the children of God, we must learn how to keep the unity.<p>The Lord Jesus, on His last night on this earth before His crucifixion, offered one prayer to God-that we all may be one that the people of this earth may know that the Lord is God&#8217;s Christ. The building up of the saints into one corporate expression of Christ is the real testimony. Oh, may we defeat the divisions! The severest test among God&#8217;s children today is this matter of unity. It will test and prove where we are. Because we are the children of God and members of Christ, there is no reason and no ground for us to be divided. We must be one and proclaim that we are one. Then we will have the basis to subdue and recover this earth and rout God&#8217;s enemy. We must do whatever we can to keep the unity. I say again, this is a real test, a real cross, a putting to death, and a burying of one&#8217;s self.<p>We must be clear about these two things: God&#8217;s intention in His creation is to have a corporate vessel in His image to express Himself in a corporate way, and secondly, to represent Him on this earth, having His authority. Positively, this means there is only one corporate vessel to express God. And negatively, there is only one corporate representative to deal with God&#8217;s enemy, and subdue this rebellious earth. This is not to be accomplished in heaven, but on this earth. May it be so today.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE STEPS TO ATTAIN GOD&#8217;S GOAL</h1><p>It is God&#8217;s desire that we realize and fulfill the vision of His building on this earth. To do this we must see the basic points of God&#8217;s building work from the entire Bible. In the beginning of the Scripture we are mainly aware of God&#8217;s work of creation. However, all of God&#8217;s creation is for His building. It is true that the natural scenery of animals, trees and flowers portrayed in Genesis 1 and 2 is not a picture of building, but of creation. But at the end of Revelation, there is a city, a building. In a garden we are aware of the natural scenery, but in a city we are mainly aware of buildings. At the beginning of the Scripture, the garden is central in the universe; but at the end, the building is the center.<p>God has only two kinds of work in the entire universe: creation and building. And the creation is for the building. By creation God gained the ground and prepared the materials for the building. When the ground is obtained and the materials are on hand, we naturally expect to see the construction work of the building proceed. God&#8217;s creation work is not the end; there is a need for the building.<h2 class=head1>A PRINCIPLE OF UNDERSTANDING GOD&#8217;S WORD</h2><p>Before considering Genesis 2, where God reveals the steps He uses to attain His goal, it is imperative to see an important principle regarding how to properly study the Scriptures.<p>In chapter 22 of Matthew we see how the Lord Jesus rebuked the Sadducees for their unbelief in the resurrection by quoting a short passage from Exodus 3:6. He referred them to the title of God-The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob-and in this very title He proved that resurrection is implied. If we take this passage just in letter or in a natural way, we can never see resurrection in this title. But Jesus pointed out that since God is the God of the living, then Abraham, Isaac and Jacob must be resurrected. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had died, but God is not the God of the dead; therefore, resurrection is proven to be a fact. This is the divine way to study and understand the Scriptures.<h2 class=head1>NATURAL VERSUS DIVINE UNDERSTANDING</h2><p>As a lad I was much troubled when I read the first two chapters of Genesis. When I read that God formed man out of the dust, I laughed to myself, thinking, &#8220;It is just like a little boy making something out of dirt.&#8221; Then I read that He breathed life into man, and I thought, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just like a child at play?&#8221; When I read that God put man before a tree called the tree of life, I simply could not understand. I could comprehend an apple tree or peach tree, but what was this tree of life? Genesis 2 goes on to tell of a flowing river which was divided into four branches. Then suddenly gold is mentioned, good gold, and another item, called bdellium, and finally onyx stone. Following this, the Lord brought every living creature before Adam, and Adam named each one. But eventually Adam became disappointed, for of the myriads of living creatures he could find none as a suitable counterpart for himself. Then you remember how God put him to sleep, opened his side, and removed a rib; and from that rib God made a woman in the same form and likeness as Adam. Then when Adam awoke and beheld the woman, he said, &#8220;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.&#8221; He said in effect, &#8220;This is my counterpart.&#8221; And the two became one. When I read this account as a youth I exclaimed, &#8220;This is really comical! What does it all mean?&#8221;<p>It is very difficult to understand the record of Genesis 2 unless the Lord opens our eyes and imparts heavenly vision. Only the Lord Jesus, who had such wisdom to see God&#8217;s resurrection in the title, &#8220;The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,&#8221; can impart to us the real meaning of Genesis 2. Praise the Lord, since 1938 this chapter has been continually opened to us. For more than thirty years the Holy Spirit has been bringing us back again and again to this chapter.<p>Genesis 1 shows us that God&#8217;s intention in creation is positively to have a corporate man as His unique expression, and negatively to use this man as His representative to deal with His enemy and subdue this rebellious earth. This means that God desires to fully recover the earth. Many people want to go to heaven, but God desires this earth; man and earth are vital and dear to God. Then Genesis 2, not as a continuation, but as a supplement, reveals to us in detail how God could attain the goal of His intention. Step by step we are shown how God will accomplish His expression and representation in man. There are at least six steps.<h2 class=head1>THE FIRST STEP-MAKING MAN A VESSEL</h2><p>&#8220;The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul&#8221; (Gen. 2:7). In this verse God reveals that man consists of three parts: firstly, a physical body, formed out of dust; secondly, the breath of life, breathed into the nostrils of that body; and thirdly, when these two parts were composed together, man became a living soul. The first part was a body, and the last part a soul. The second part is &#8220;the breath of life&#8221; breathed into man&#8217;s body. The same Hebrew word for &#8220;breath&#8221; is translated &#8220;spirit&#8221; (the spirit of man) in Proverbs 20:27. So the second part must be the spirit of man. Therefore, this verse mentions a body without, a spirit within, and a soul produced by the composition of the body and spirit. So man consists of spirit, soul, and body (cf. 1 Thes. 5:23).<p>It is very important to realize that God formed man as a vessel, a container (Rom. 9:21, 23), not as an instrument for some kind of use. An instrument may be constructed for use, yet still not be a vessel capable of containing something. Man was created as a vessel into which God put the breath of life as the very spirit of man.<p>What is the function or purpose of man&#8217;s spirit? We may use as an example a transistor radio. A transistor radio is a plastic box containing a certain electronic component which we will call a receiver. This receiver within the box is capable of contacting and receiving the electric waves from the air. Likewise, our human spirit is our receiver to contact and receive God within us. However, it is one thing to mentally comprehend the fact that we have a spirit, but quite another to daily exercise our inner receiver to contact and receive God. We may be like a foolish boy who appreciates the bright and shiny box given to him, yet does not know that it has an inner receiver. Like the boy with the box, we may lavish care upon our body, pampering and polishing it, and yet never exercising the divinely-given receiver within to contact and receive something of God.<p>When we know how to use our inner receiver, we will not be so concerned with the &#8220;box.&#8221; Our main concern will be that the receiver works. So many Christians clean and polish the outside of the box. Personally, I am not much concerned with a little untidiness on a person if I hear the &#8220;heavenly music&#8221; coming from within. I would rather see a naughty boy full of life than a very clean and tidy dead boy. There are so many pretty &#8220;boxes&#8221; today without the heavenly music. Where are those Christians who know how to exercise their spirit to contact God? Many Christians are so quiet-they never bother anyone. Personally, I like to be bothered by heavenly music.<p>God&#8217;s chief desire is that we contact Him with our spirit. Man&#8217;s spirit, breathed into him by God at creation, is the very mark of God&#8217;s working today. This is God&#8217;s economy. If we miss this mark, God&#8217;s economy does not work. All the interests of God&#8217;s eternal economy hinge on this very receiver, our human spirit. If we would reach the goal and realize God&#8217;s intention, we must first know that we are a vessel made by God and that we have a spirit within as a receiver to receive and contain God. This is why Hebrews 4:12 says that we must discern the spirit from the soul. It is only when we discern our spirit that we can know how to contact God within. &#8220;God is Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit&#8221; (the human spirit).<p>Therefore, God&#8217;s first step towards the goal of His intention is the forming of man as a vessel and putting into this human vessel a spirit as a receiver to receive God.<h2 class=head1>THE SECOND STEP-MAN PARTAKING OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>&#8220;The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden&#8221; (Gen. 2:8, 9).<p>As far as God&#8217;s relationship with man is concerned, the earth is the center of the universe, the garden is the center of the earth, and the tree of life is the center of that garden. God&#8217;s second step in fulfilling His intention was to put man, His empty vessel, in front of the tree of life.<p>If you saw a painting of a fountain flowing with water and an empty vessel before it, what would you conjecture? I think that even a little child would exclaim, &#8220;The vessel needs to be filled with water!&#8221; Genesis 2 shows a &#8220;cartoon&#8221; of a tree with an empty little man with a receiver within standing before that tree. This indicates that God intended man to be filled with the tree of life. This fact is later confirmed by the New Testament accounts which tell us that when the Lord Jesus came to earth, life was found in Him. Jesus Christ is the life (John 14:6). And He came that we may have life and have it more abundantly (John 10:10). John&#8217;s Gospel also reveals the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. In Genesis God presented the tree of life to man in the form of food. The Lord Jesus also presented Himself in the form of food to be received by us. If we eat Him as the bread of life, we will receive Him as the reality of the tree of life into us.<p>Not many Christians today know how to exercise their spirit to take Christ as food. Even grade school children can understand the teachings concerning the spirit in one lesson. But this is a matter to be practiced, not merely comprehended mentally as a doctrine. Do you exercise your spirit day by day to take Christ as your food, feeding on Him all day long? This is the central problem today. Adam was put before the tree of life, but he did not partake of it. Are you in the same condition? Every Christian has Christ within, but how many are exercising their spirit to enjoy Christ, feeding on Him as the reality of the tree of life? Why is the church in such a poor condition today? Simply because most of us do not know how to exercise our spirit to feed on Christ as our daily food.<p>God created man with a spirit to receive something. And man, as an empty vessel, was placed before the tree of life. Now we are clear that God&#8217;s intention in placing man before this tree was that he might receive life in the form of food. Being a Christian, as far as our relationship with God is concerned, is not a matter of working for God, but a matter of eating. We must forget about trying to do things for God, and give our full attention to eating properly. Adam&#8217;s entire future depended on what he ate. If he ate properly, he would live properly; but if he ate wrongly, he would die. We can never exhaust the subject of learning how to partake of Christ-that which was portrayed and foreshadowed in Genesis 2. Neither can we exhaust the full message of this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE THIRD STEP-THE RIVER FLOWING</h2><p>The third step towards God&#8217;s goal concerns a river which issued out of Eden to water the garden and from thence was parted and became four heads (v. 10). Notice, the river came forth to water the garden. It is very meaningful. And then this river springing forth from one source became four branches, flowing to the four directions of the earth. As we see the tree of life in this chapter, we are also aware of a river flowing by its side. It is an impressive picture: a tree, a man before the tree, and a river flowing beside the man. The tree of life is for food, and the river is for watering. By experience we know that when we feed on Christ as our life, we immediately sense the flowing of something within watering us. If we do not feed on Christ, we will soon be withered and dried, for we will consequently lose the watering of the flowing river. When we fellowship with the Lord, feeding on Him continually, we not only sense satisfaction, but also a flowing within us. The life which is Christ Himself taken in the form of food and enjoyed by us is also the living water flowing within us. The Gospel of John testifies to this. The Lord Jesus is the food of life and He is also the living water continually springing up within us.<h2 class=head1>THE FOURTH STEP-PRODUCING PRECIOUS MATERIALS</h2><p>We can also observe three precious items in this impressive painting. In the flowing of the river there is gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. What is this mysterious substance called bdellium? The best Hebrew authorities offer two schools of thought. One says that bdellium is a resin, a kind of gum, which issues from a certain tree as sap. The second school insists that bdellium is a kind of pearl. I feel that both are right, for with either resin or pearl the principle is the same. Gum comes forth from a living tree containing the sap of life. Once the tree is damaged or broken, it secretes this living sap, which eventually becomes a brilliant and transparent gum. The pearl also comes forth from something living, an oyster, containing the juice of life. At some time in its history the oyster is wounded, and its life juice is secreted around the wounded area. Eventually, a transparent pearl is produced. The principle regarding the gum and the pearl is the same; the only difference is that the gum issues from the vegetable life, whereas the pearl is brought forth from the animal life.<p>These two aspects are seen in the Lord Jesus Christ. John 1:29 refers to Jesus as the Lamb-that is the animal kingdom. John 12 and 15 respectively portray Jesus as the grain of wheat and the vine tree-these are of the vegetable kingdom. The principle of the animal life is that of sacrifice: Christ sacrificed His life by shedding His blood for us. The principle of the vegetable kingdom is that of the generation of life-Christ was the grain of wheat who fell into the ground and died to generate us as the many grains. Whether bdellium is gum from a tree or a pearl from an oyster, the principle is the same: the life must be hurt and broken and the life juice secreted to flow out and bring forth something precious.<p>By a thorough reading of Scripture, we understand that these three items from the river-gold, bdellium and onyx stone-are the precious materials for the building of God. Thus, the watering or flowing of the river produces the precious materials. God&#8217;s fourth step in attaining the goal of His building is the bringing forth of these materials.<p>In God&#8217;s building, both of the tabernacle and the temple, the high priest serving within had as part of his clothing shoulder plates and a breast plate full of precious stones. If we could look inside at that scene, we would see only gold and precious stones. This is the composition of God&#8217;s building.<p>In the New Testament Paul tells us that the church must be built with gold, silver and precious stones (1 Cor. 3). Why did Paul mention silver as one of the building materials? Because pearl, which symbolizes the generating life of Christ, was mentioned chronologically in Scripture before the time when redemption was needed. When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, not only pearl, but also silver was required. Paul spoke of silver because it symbolizes redemption, and fallen man must be redeemed. In eternity pearl is again mentioned in the place of silver, for by that time redemption is fully accomplished.<p>Now let us look briefly at the end of the Scripture, where the New Jerusalem is portrayed. This city is composed of exactly the same materials mentioned in Genesis 2. But in Genesis these materials are by the river, while in Revelation they are built up into a city. Between the two ends of Scripture, God&#8217;s building work is accomplished.<p>Now put yourself in Adam&#8217;s place for a moment and look at the precious, shining materials. Now look at yourself. Do you shine as they do? How we long to be like those precious materials! But this requires a real transformation work. Adam, including all of us in him, was made of dust. We are just pieces of clay. As such, if we want to be like those precious materials for God&#8217;s building, we must partake of the tree of life. Let the life of the tree of life flow within you, and this flowing life will transform you. Second Corinthians 3, verses 6, 17 and 18 reveal the thought of transformation by the flowing of life. The Lord is the Spirit who gives life, and by this life-giving Spirit we will be transformed from clay into the precious materials for God&#8217;s building. We must remember that we were made with a spirit to contact and receive God. In principle we also are in front of the tree of life to receive Christ as life in the form of food. When we enjoy this food, the life will flow within us, watering and transforming us. By this process we are transformed from clay into gold, pearl and precious stones.<p>These three precious materials from the river are also related to the three persons and particularly the work of the Triune God. Gold refers to the Father, pearl to the Son, and precious stones to the Holy Spirit. When we receive Him, God the Father is like gold within us. He is the source. Christ the Son was wounded by us just as the oyster, and out from Him came the secretion of life which produces the pearl. The work of the Holy Spirit is related to the precious stones. A precious stone is formed by being burned with intense heat and pressed with intense pressure. When we enjoy Christ as food and realize His constant flowing and watering within, we will be transformed by the Spirit from a piece of clay into precious materials. And these materials are for God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE FIFTH STEP-BUILDING TOGETHER</h2><p>The fifth step of God&#8217;s intention in creation is the process of our being built up as His building. I have observed many Christians who are very proper in conduct and who appear quite spiritual. But the precious stones God needs are not for men&#8217;s praise but for God&#8217;s building. God desires to transform us that we may be built up with others as His building. God desires a house, not a myriad of individual precious stones to be put on display. The great need of today&#8217;s Christians is to be mutually constructed as God&#8217;s building. If we learn to be built up with others, we will have the victory, the riches, sanctification, holiness, power, and the fulness of God. Our only need is to be built up with others in God&#8217;s building.<p>In chapter 1 we illustrated what happens to an isolated, severed member of the body. It may seem to be healthy and function properly, but it is of no avail. This is the prevailing condition of today&#8217;s Christianity. So many individuals are seeking power and a holy life, yet the more they seek, the poorer they become. Each of us must learn to be built up together with other saints as a living body. No matter where we are or where we go, we must be built up with others in that locality. In a later chapter we will consider how we may be related with others. My present burden is that we all may see the need of being built up with others as God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE SIXTH STEP-PRODUCING A BRIDE</h2><p>The sixth and last step of how God will attain His goal is the producing of a Bride. &#8220;The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him&#8221; (v. 18). J. N. Darby translates this portion more clearly in his footnote. He says, &#8220;I will make him a helpmate, his counterpart.&#8221; We need to compare this portion of Scripture with Ephesians 5:22-32 for the proper interpretation.<p>The Bride is synonymous with the building. In the final picture of Scripture, the Holy City, New Jerusalem, is not only the tabernacle of God, but also the Bride of Christ. When the Bride appears, God&#8217;s final goal is reached. In Genesis, the first Adam was a type of Christ, and Eve was a type of the church. In Revelation, the Bride, the church, is the counterpart to match the last Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ.<p>It is only when seeking Christians are locally built up together that there will be a real Bride to match Christ. That will be a victorious display, a real gain and glory to Christ. What a disgrace to our Lord that for hundreds of years on this earth there has been so little of a Bride to match Him and be His counterpart! Yes, there have been and there presently are many materials, but they are so poor. There are not many who are shining and bright; there are not many precious stones. There are poor materials, and there is hardly any building. Where can you find a real building of God today?<p>The picture shown in Ezekiel 37 is an exact portrayal of the present situation in Christianity. There are many dead and dry bones without one living body; and there is no house, no army. But eventually the dry bones are resurrected and formed together as a living body. This body is the house, the dwelling place of God, and it is also the army which fights the battles for God. Someday God&#8217;s children will be recovered and raised up to realize God&#8217;s intention. Then they will not want to be individualistically &#8220;spiritual,&#8221; but corporately built up with others. God&#8217;s desire for a house will be satisfied, and there will be a Body and a Bride for His Son. We know this for a fact. The final picture in Revelation is the Bride, the building of the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>SOME COMPARISONS-THE BIBLE AND A BUILDING MANUAL</h2><p>There are four corresponding items seen both in the beginning and at the end of Scripture: a Bride, the tree of life, a flowing river, and three precious materials-gold, pearl, and precious stones. There is a distinct resemblance and a definite correlation. Genesis 1 and 2 are like the blueprint in the beginning of a manual of building instructions. Revelation 21 and 22 are like a photo of the finished structure inserted at the end of the manual. First we look at the blueprint; then we read the building instructions and go to work; finally, at the end, we attain the finished structure, similar in every detail to the photo in the manual. The Scriptures are such an instruction book regarding God&#8217;s building. At the beginning there is the blueprint, and at the end there is the completion according to the initial concept.<p>We must spend much time in the detailed instructions of this &#8220;manual.&#8221; But first we must be deeply impressed that we are a vessel made with a spirit, an inner recipient to receive God. We must learn how to exercise our spirit continually to contact and receive God. Next we must realize that God in Christ by the Spirit is the tree of life, the real food for us to eat and enjoy. As we enjoy Christ in such a way, we will have the flowing of the living water within us, and by this flowing we will be transformed from clay into precious materials. Then as transformed materials we must be built up with others. We cannot be independent, precious Christians. We must learn to be related with others and very dependent. Finally, such a building will be the Bride on this earth, the Bride which will satisfy Christ.<p>We have seen now the corporate man whom God is after is not only His expression and representative, but also the Bride to satisfy the Bridegroom. However, it is only when we are enjoying Christ as our food that we may be transformed, and it is only as we are being transformed that we may be built up with others, and it is only as we are built up with others that Christ will have full satisfaction with us. We will be the expression and representative of God as well as the Bride of Christ.<p>We all know that in ourselves, by ourselves, and with ourselves-in our natural life-we can never be one with others. Every natural man is a peculiar man, a separate man. A husband in his natural state is not one with his wife. Though we are husband and wife, the closest relationship on earth, we are individually peculiar and naturally divided. It is impossible in such a state to be one. Our natural life must be swallowed up by Christ. We must learn how to contact and feed on Christ in our spirit. We must learn how to deny ourself, rejecting our natural life, and live by Christ. Then the Lord will flow within, transforming us from clay into precious stone. Then, as we are united, related, and built up with others, God&#8217;s goal will be attained.<p>From Genesis 2 we have briefly outlined six steps, showing how God&#8217;s intention is to be realized. These matters are not doctrines. We must pray over all these points. We must see a recovery of such a testimony, a group of people who practice these things, giving all the honor and glory to the ascended Head because they are His Body on this earth. Then there will be a Bride on this earth to express God and to satisfy Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>SATAN&#8217;S COUNTERFEITS</h1><p>We have seen that God&#8217;s intention is to have a group of people built up as a spiritual building to express God and to represent God by dealing with His enemy and recovering this lost earth. But before God could accomplish this goal, the evil one, Satan, intervened.<p>It is a principle that Satan always does something beforehand as a counterfeit of the thing God intends to do. He knew that it was God&#8217;s intention to have a building, so he preceded God to build a counterfeit. God has to wait, but Satan never waits. In the garden of Eden he damaged the man whom God had made for the purpose of His building. Eventually, from that damaged man, Satan&#8217;s counterfeit was brought into being. Before God&#8217;s building, the New Jerusalem, could come into existence, Satan&#8217;s counterfeit cities were built.<h2 class=head1>THE CITY OF ENOCH VERSUS NOAH&#8217;S ARK</h2><p>&#8220;And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch&#8221; (Gen. 4:16, 17). It was not long after man had fallen that Cain left the presence of the Lord to dwell in a land called Nod. Nod means &#8220;floating&#8221; or &#8220;wandering.&#8221; Cain was in a state of wandering, for he had gone out from the presence of the Lord. As such he built a city apart from God&#8217;s presence and named it, not after God, but after his son Enoch. Chapters 4 through 6 of Genesis reveal that the city of Enoch was the center of the first civilization instituted by the fallen human race. It was a city in opposition to God, a city full of sin, a city to make a name for man. All manner of human inventions were initiated in this city.<p>This city was Satan&#8217;s first counterfeit building. He knew God&#8217;s intention of building up human beings as one person to express God; and he was well aware of God&#8217;s intention to deal with him in order to regain the lost earth. So he took over. He built up the fallen people for his purpose, to express himself and to oppose God. This was why God judged that city and that dispensation with the flood.<p>But before God judged the wicked city of Enoch by a flood, He called a righteous man who walked in His presence and appointed him to undertake a building in opposition to Satan&#8217;s counterfeit city. God commanded Noah: &#8220;Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it&#8221; (Gen. 6:14-16).<p>The details of the ark built by Noah are exceedingly significant. It was of gopher wood and overspread within and without with pitch. In the Hebrew language, pitch is the same as the word used for atonement. The entire ark was pitched with atonement. Every dimension and specification is full of meaning. Its length was three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. Thus the dimensions were either one hundred times three, ten times five, or ten times three. In addition, the ark was three stories high. This was the fashion of God&#8217;s first building.<p>What is the real meaning of the ark? It is an over-all type of Christ. But in this ark, in this Christ, are the three persons of the Godhead. The Triune God is in Christ, mingled together with the human nature. This is typified by the ark&#8217;s three stories-the lower, the second, and the third stories. Christ in the human nature is typified by the wood used in the ark&#8217;s construction. Wood, we know, is a type of humanity.<p>In the dimensions of the ark the numbers three and five appear repeatedly. In Scripture the number three signifies the Triune God. To see the significance of the number five we must consider its constituents-four plus one. Four signifies creation, as testified by the four living creatures mentioned in Revelation and the four winds of the earth, etc. One signifies the one, unique God. Thus, creation plus God give us the significance of number five. The ten commandments were divided into two groups of five. Five is also mentioned many times in the building of the tabernacle. And in the New Testament the ten virgins were divided into two groups of five. Five signifies the mingling of God with man; it means that man with God mingled with him must take responsibility.<p>The ark, as we have seen, typifies Christ in human nature with the three persons of the Godhead-God mingled with His creation. The ark built by Noah contained all the basic principles of God&#8217;s design for His building throughout eternity. God&#8217;s building is a building of Christ in human nature with the three persons of the Godhead; that is, divinity mingled with humanity. We will see the full development of these vital principles in the final New Jerusalem in later chapters.<p>We must all be in this ark, in Christ. All our activities, all our daily walk, whatever we do, must be in these principles of Christ in human nature, containing the three persons of the Godhead-God mingled with humanity. We must preach the Gospel in these principles and we must practice the church life in these principles.<p>In the beginning of Scripture we have a contrast of the first building of the fallen human race, a city called Enoch, and the first building of God, an ark constructed according to His design.<p>We must realize that since the time of Noah, there have always been on this earth only two kinds of buildings-one of God and the other of Satan. One kind is in the hand of the human race and is much utilized by the enemy as a counterfeit to damage God&#8217;s building; the other kind, God&#8217;s building, is completely apart from man&#8217;s building, even as the ark of Noah. These two kinds of buildings are proceeding on the earth even at this present time. To which do you belong? Praise the Lord, in God&#8217;s building we have a place as a refuge.<p>Noah had a share in this building, and after the flood he knew what he must continue to do. &#8220;And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord...and offered burnt offerings on the altar&#8221; (Gen. 8:20). Later we read that Noah and his sons dwelt in tents (Gen. 9:21, 27). After living in an ark, Noah&#8217;s life involved an altar and a tent. We will see later that the tabernacle of God consisted of a tent with an altar. Noah&#8217;s tent was not only his dwelling place, but must also have been the dwelling place of God, where Noah was living in the presence of God; where Noah was, there was God. Noah&#8217;s tent with the altar was a miniature of the coming tabernacle with the burnt-offering altar.<p>We have clearly seen a definite contrast-the building of the human race and the building of God. Cain&#8217;s building is a product of the fallen human race, a city called Enoch. But God chose Noah to build an absolutely different structure-an ark, according to God&#8217;s specifications. And, when Noah disembarked after the flood, he did not build another city, but erected an altar along with a tent for his dwelling. This is the first contrast: a city versus an ark, an altar and a tent.<h2 class=head1>BABEL AND SODOM VERSUS ABRAHAM&#8217;S TENT</h2><p>Noah&#8217;s example of walking in God&#8217;s presence and being for God&#8217;s building did not last long. Soon after the flood Noah&#8217;s descendants began to fall. They joined together and forgot about living in a tent with an altar. Instead they began to build a city named Babel. &#8220;And they said one to another go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth&#8221; (Gen. 11:3-4).<p>Notice that these fallen people built their city with mud, straw, and brick, rather than stone. These are the exact materials used later by Pharaoh of Egypt. Stone is a creation of God, while brick is a product of human hands. God&#8217;s building is always of stone, while Satan&#8217;s counterfeit building is always made with brick, the work of human hands.<p>The people of Babel began to build a tower, for their intention was to reach unto heaven. Fallen man always has the thought of going to heaven, but God&#8217;s desire is to come down to earth. Basically, this tower signified man&#8217;s intention to accomplish something in opposition to God. These fallen builders, in the same character as Cain, said &#8220;Let us make us a name...&#8221; They forgot God&#8217;s name and sought to make a name for themselves. How many cities there are today which are named after famous men. Human builders always seek to enhance their own names.<p>But &#8220;the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded&#8221; (Gen. 11:5). God beheld a strange sight in this city. The people were one, for they had one language. They were built up, but not in the way of God. Their building and the way of their building was Satan&#8217;s counterfeit. And the Lord said, &#8220;Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language&#8221; (v. 7). The Lord said, &#8220;Let us...&#8221; This signified the three persons of the Godhead. The Triune God came down and judged this city, destroying fallen man&#8217;s work. The name of the city was called Babel, because &#8220;the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth.&#8221; Babel is an Old Testament Hebrew name of which the Greek rendering is Babylon. Both have the same meaning. Babel was the source, the commencement of Babylon.<p>Let us now see the building of God in contrast to this second city built by fallen man. God called a man named Abraham out of Babel. Abraham was typical of the local people but God separated him from the building of fallen man. Notice now what Abraham did. He did not start to build another city, calling it by his own name. He did not even build a city in the name of God. God brought Abraham to an elevated place called Canaan and there told him to build an altar. Abraham obeyed, erecting an altar and pitching a tent for his dwelling. Again we see the tent with an altar in contrast to the city built by fallen man. Again God recovered the life of His building. Noah&#8217;s descendants had lost it, but God recovered His building with the calling out of Abraham.<p>However, Abraham in the land of Canaan was still in a dangerous position. On one side was the city of Babel, and on the other side the city of Sodom. Abraham was separated from Babel and kept also from Sodom. But Abraham&#8217;s nephew Lot drifted into the city of Sodom.<p>One day while Abraham was sitting in the door of his tent three men appeared. It was the Lord with two angels (Gen. 18:1). The Lord asked Abraham, &#8220;Where is Sarah thy wife?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;In the tent.&#8221; That is a good answer. After a time of fellowship Abraham&#8217;s visitors arose and journeyed toward Sodom, the city of sin. Abraham, unwilling to leave their presence, brought them on their way. As they went towards Sodom, &#8220;Abraham stood yet before the Lord&#8221; (v. 22). He was in the presence of the Lord, not in the city of sin.<p>Chapter 19 of Genesis tells a pitiful story. There came two angels to Sodom (the Lord was not included-He would not go there). The angels did not visit the city in the day while the sun was shining, but in the evening at the setting of the sun. As darkness was descending, the two angels followed Lot, sitting not at a tent door like Abraham, but in a gate of Sodom. This is a picture of a man in a fallen state, fallen in the darkness.<p>History reveals that Babel was principally a city of idol worship. But Sodom was a city of sin. Many today find it easy to be separated from the &#8220;building&#8221; of idol worship. But it is not so easy to be kept from drifting into the city of sin. We must see these contrasts. Abraham lived in a tent opposite to Babel. And then he lived in a tent opposite to Sodom. Here we see the contrast between a tent and the fallen cities of man.<p>Notice also how Abraham trained his son Isaac. Genesis 24:67 reveals how Isaac brought his new bride into his mother&#8217;s tent. And in Genesis 26 Isaac is again shown in his old age pitching his tent in the valley of Gerar. This is all very meaningful. Abraham&#8217;s grandson, Jacob, also dwelt in a tent (Gen. 25:27). Esau, Jacob&#8217;s brother, was a hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a man who dwelt in a tent. Therefore, three generations-Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob-dwelt in a tent, not in any city. God is called the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Spiritually speaking, this signifies that these men lived in God&#8217;s building rather than in the building of the fallen human race.<h2 class=head1>JACOB&#8217;S DREAM CONCERNING GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>One day Jacob went from Beersheba toward Haran. &#8220;And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place [literally, he took one of the stones of that place], and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: and the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed...and, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land...and Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, how dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel...&#8221; (Gen. 28:11-19).<p>In his dream Jacob saw a ladder set up on the earth. God&#8217;s testimony must be set up on this earth, not in the heavens. Jacob called the name of that place Bethel, which in Hebrew means &#8220;the house of God.&#8221; Then Jacob vowed a vow, saying, &#8220;If God will be with me, and will keep me...and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on...&#8221; (v. 20). What a shame! Jacob did not have to vow such a vow, for God had already given him His promise. God has signed the policy; we must just receive it. Jacob said, &#8220;If...&#8221; Why did he interject that little word? We must realize that &#8220;if&#8221; always proceeds from our mind, not from our spirit. Jacob was concerned for bread and raiment. He was just the same as we are: food and raiment are the two items for which we are always concerned. Upon all these conditions Jacob finally said, &#8220;Then shall the Lord be my God&#8221; (v. 21). That meant that if God would not provide for all of Jacob&#8217;s requests, Jacob would not take Him as his God. We know that all the descendants of Jacob are such good businessmen; they are always making a deal, a bargain.<p>Jacob spoke much for himself, but he also spoke a wonderful word, a word full of vision: &#8220;This stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God&#8217;s house&#8221; (v. 22). This meant that not only the place in which Jacob slept should be called God&#8217;s dwelling place, but even the stone upon which he rested was to be called the house of God. However, the old man in Jacob was again exposed, and he said, &#8220;And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.&#8221; He said in effect, &#8220;Lord, You give me ten items, and I will give You one.&#8221; What a bargain-Jacob was going to make a ninety percent profit!<p>When Jacob returned to his father&#8217;s land, he journeyed to a city called Shechem. He would not go into the city, however, but pitched his tent before it. Later he bought a parcel of field, where he spread his tent. He did not build a house. On this ground he erected an altar and called it &#8220;Elelohe Israel&#8221; (Gen. 33:18-20). Thus, building a tent and an altar, he followed in the exact footsteps of his forefathers. He did not call the altar after himself, seeking to make a name for himself, but by the name of God. &#8220;El&#8221; means God, and &#8220;elohe&#8221; also means God. The name that Jacob ascribed to this altar means &#8220;God is the God of Israel.&#8221;<p>After a considerable lapse of time, God told Jacob to go up to Bethel. Jacob had done well in erecting an altar, but he was still not in the proper place, on the proper ground. He had to go to Bethel and build there an altar. Jacob did, and he called that place &#8220;El Bethel,&#8221; that is, the God of Bethel (Gen. 35:1, 6-7). There God met Jacob and was with him, and Jacob did all things in the presence of God. Notice that Jacob added something in his second visit: he still called the name of the place &#8220;Bethel,&#8221; but he added the prefix &#8220;El&#8221; (that is, &#8220;God&#8221;) to it.<h2 class=head1>TWO EGYPTIAN CITIES VERSUS GOD&#8217;S TABERNACLE</h2><p>We have seen how Abraham was separated from Babel, the city of idols, and was kept from Sodom, the city of sin. However, his descendants, Jacob&#8217;s children, were not kept from falling into another counterfeit of Satan. They drifted into Egypt and were eventually forced into slavery. They were compelled to build two cities of treasure for Pharaoh (Exo. 1:11). They were forced to use building materials of mud and hay for bricks. This is indeed meaningful. Later we will see that the Israelites, freed from Egyptian bondage, were asked in the wilderness to bring forth materials for God&#8217;s building. Those materials included gold and precious stones; onyx stones, the very stones mentioned in Genesis 2, were included. Here is the third contrast. Two cities, built up with straw and mud bricks in Egypt, are in opposition to the Lord&#8217;s tabernacle, built up with materials which included gold and precious stones, in the wilderness.<p>We now have seen three of Satan&#8217;s counterfeits in contrast to God&#8217;s building. These counterfeits comprised four cities, or in principle, three kinds of worlds-a world of idols, a world of sin, and a world of enjoyment. It is easy for most Christians to be separated from the world of idols. With some, perhaps, it is also easy to be kept from the world of sin. However, it is not so easy for any of us to be protected from the world of enjoyment. We may not be found in Babel or in Sodom, but I fear that many of us are still in Egypt, the world of enjoyment and wealth. American Christians especially know the meaning of enjoyment. Here is a real danger for the Lord&#8217;s children. Christians must have nothing to do with idols or with sin, but neither should we be entangled by the world of enjoyment. If so, we are cheated and deceived by Pharaoh; we are taken captive. If so, we must labor strenuously for the treasure cities. If you ask some Christians why they do not attend the meetings of the church, they will reply that they do not have time. This is because all their time is spent in labor for the treasure cities. Is this your occupation? With so many of us, Satan, the prince of this world, is forcing us to labor in mud, brick and straw. As long as we are working on earthly things, there will never be anything of a heavenly nature about us. As long as we are in Egypt, working for the treasure cities, we have nothing to do with God&#8217;s building. Day by day we will be busy laboring for the world of enjoyment. Praise God that we have been separated from idol worship and kept from sin. But are we still in the fallen state of the treasure cities? May God deliver us from this also into His building.<p>When the people of Israel were delivered out of the work of those cities and brought to Mount Sinai, they were completely free. They were free from Babel, from Sodom, and from the treasure cities of Pharaoh. Their hands were then free to do the work of God&#8217;s building. All their possessions, indeed everything, was freed for God&#8217;s building! The tabernacle was erected, and for forty years Israel did nothing but continuously deal with that tabernacle. More than two million people did nothing but busy themselves with the tabernacle! Whenever they tarried on their journey, they erected the tabernacle and worshipped. Whenever they traveled, they carried the tabernacle with them. All their activities were with that tabernacle. They were completely free from any other kind of occupation and entanglement. They offered themselves and all they had for the building of the Lord. They no longer labored in mud, brick and straw, but rather with gold and precious stones to build up a dwelling place for God.<p>We have previously mentioned that we must know how to exercise our spirit to contact Christ that we may enjoy Him as the flowing life within us and thus be transformed into precious materials for God&#8217;s building. This is all necessary; but if we are still in one of these three cities-the city of idolatry, sin, or enjoyment-we cannot possibly share in God&#8217;s building. To share in the building of God we must be separated from Babel, the city of idols; we must be kept from Sodom, the city of sin; and we must be delivered out of the two Egyptian cities of treasure and enjoyment. Then we will be in a liberated position, completely available to share in God&#8217;s building. We must have nothing to do with idols, with sin, or with worldly enjoyment.<p>Look at the situation of Christianity today: so many are still in Babel, others are in Sodom, and a great number of dear Christians are enslaved in the treasure cities. They are under forced labor, toiling for the building of those cities, for enjoyment and security. There are not many, sorry to say, who are for God&#8217;s building today. We have traveled quite extensively in this country, yet we have seen few Christians who are really out of Egypt. There are some who have come out of Babel and Sodom, but so many are still entangled by the treasures of this world, by the lust for security and enjoyment. It is difficult to find many Christians who are standing in the position of freedom and availability for God&#8217;s building. Some indeed know the teaching concerning the exercise of the human spirit to contact Christ as life; yet they are still in the treasure cities. In that position they can surely contact the treasure of worldly enjoyment, but they must give up these cities if they would contact Christ. This is exactly why so many Christians today have such a problem exercising their spirit to contact Christ. So many messages on this subject have very little effect on certain people, because they are still in the treasure cities, they are still entangled in Egypt. They are quick to say, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m not in Babel, I have nothing to do with idols. I&#8217;m not in Sodom either, I have nothing to do with sin.&#8221; But can we say that we are not in Egypt, that we are not entangled by the world of security and enjoyment?<p>Peter, in Acts 3:6, could say, &#8220;Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee.&#8221; What Peter had was the mighty name of Jesus. Not many Christians could say this today. Yes, they will confess the Lord&#8217;s name, but the power of that name for them has been lost. They cannot say, &#8220;Silver and gold have I none.&#8221; They can afford a considerable amount of silver and gold. If we would share in the building of God, we must be delivered out of all these cities. If we would exercise our spirit to contact Christ, we must be disentangled from the enjoyment of the world; otherwise, our spiritual exercise will be of no avail.<p>We must always be on the alert, for we are endangered by these three fronts: Babel, Sodom, and the cities of Egypt. When we are delivered from these, our hands are free for God&#8217;s building. When we are delivered, Christ is so dear and precious to us. It is then that we know how to exercise our spirit to contact Christ. We can never enjoy Christ as our manna if we are still in Egypt. We can never enjoy Christ as the living water, continuously flowing to quench our thirst, if we are still in Egypt. When we are separated from these cities, we are in a position to share in the building of God.<p>The Scriptures are a record of God&#8217;s building and of the contrasts to God&#8217;s building. Satan, God&#8217;s enemy, is doing his best to build up the counterfeits: Babel (idols), Sodom (sin), and the treasure cities (enjoyment). When Christians are delivered from these counterfeits, they are free to partake in God&#8217;s building. Oh, may we know such freedom for God&#8217;s central desire!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>A BIRD&#8217;S-EYE VIEW</h1><p>Before proceeding further, we need a bird&#8217;s-eye view of God&#8217;s building in the entire Scriptures, especially in the first two books. Genesis and Exodus. The sixty-six books of the Bible contain many things, but we must be clear concerning the over-all view of the central matter. What do we see when we look at the entire Bible with a bird&#8217;s-eye view? One central thing stands out-the building. If we do not have a view whereby we see all things related to this matter of building, we do not understand the Scriptures. We may read and reread, but we do not have the proper understanding. We are just like one who is confined in a narrow cell, restricted by his narrow, human vision. We must have a heavenly vision to be clear about the whole of Scripture.<h2 class=head1>IN GENESIS</h2><p>With such a view the first two books of the Scriptures reveal clearly the things related to God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head2>The First Picture</h2><p>Remember the picture in Genesis 1 and 2, the first picture related to God&#8217;s building. There we saw a tree with a flowing river, and out of that flowing river came gold, pearl and precious stone, the materials for God&#8217;s building. By carefully considering that picture in the light of the whole Bible, we realize that it portrays God as life to us. If man partakes of the fruit of the tree of life, he receives God into him as life; then God&#8217;s life flows within that man, transforming him into precious materials.<p>In the garden of Eden, Adam was a piece of clay. But in the New Jerusalem, the saints are precious materials. There are no men of clay there. The twelve gates of the Holy City are named after the twelve tribes of Israel (Rev. 21:12), but the outstanding thing concerning those gates is that they are all pearls (Rev. 21:21). The twelve tribes of Israel originally consisted of men of clay. The twelve foundations of the city are named after the twelve Apostles (Rev. 21:14), that is, Peter, James, John, etc.; but these twelve foundations are made of twelve kinds of precious stone (Rev. 21:19-20). These Apostles also were originally pieces of clay. How could the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve Apostles become pearls and precious stones? The answer is that they all must be transformed. In the garden of Eden man was nothing but clay. But in the New Jerusalem, he has become not only stone, but precious stone, as well as pearl and gold-three precious items.<p>In the beginning of Scripture, there is a corporate man made of clay, containing nothing precious. But at the end of Scripture, there is another corporate man, a greatly enlarged corporate man, a city. And in this city there is nothing of clay or earth. Everything is gold, pearl and precious stone. All have been changed through the work of transformation. In the past, God accomplished His work of creation in six days, but in order to transform man He has used at least six thousand years. All Christians are in this daily process of transformation.<p>Why do Christians suffer? Many of us have a mistaken concept concerning suffering. We feel that we must have done something wrong; so we must suffer. Yet frequently we have not behaved wrongly, and still we must suffer. Why? Because such suffering is necessary for our transformation. Many Christians are too raw. They must be cooked and even burnt; others must be pressed-all that they may be transformed. Throughout my entire Christian life I have had much enjoyment of the Lord, but on the other hand I have experienced trouble upon trouble. I need the troubles if I am going to be transformed.<h2 class=head2>Enoch&#8217;s City and Noah</h2><p>We have seen that God&#8217;s purpose and intention in creation was to have a group of people as the center of His creation. God intended to have the corporate man to express Him and to represent Him by dealing with His enemy, thus recovering the lost earth. But Satan intervened and damaged man. Satan captured man and carried him away from God&#8217;s purpose, then utilized him to raise up a counterfeit of God&#8217;s intention. This issued firstly in the city of Enoch, a counterfeit of God&#8217;s building. It was God&#8217;s purpose to transform man by the flowing of His life into precious materials for His building. But Satan crept into the garden of Eden and stole this man, usurping him to build a city in opposition to God, a counterfeit of God&#8217;s building.<p>Most of us today do not realize the real meaning of the fall of man. The enemy&#8217;s goal in causing man&#8217;s fall was to utilize the fallen race to construct a counterfeit in opposition to God&#8217;s purpose. God intended to build man into a corporate expression of Himself, but Satan kidnapped this man and utilized him as material for a counterfeit city. Thus immediately following the fall of man in Genesis 3, the city of Enoch was built by the fallen race in Genesis 4. All sinful things were invented there. The city of Enoch was the source of all the evil occupations of the human race-warring, pleasure, amusement, polygamy, and all fleshly enjoyments. How much corruption and sinfulness have come out of that city! The city of Enoch was the very center of the first civilization; it was the first culture invented by the fallen race. God could not tolerate that; so He sent a flood to judge that generation. But before destroying the city, God asked Noah, a righteous man who walked continually with God, to build a structure absolutely different from Satan&#8217;s counterfeit (Gen. 6).<p>Fallen man built Satan&#8217;s city, but Noah built an ark according to God&#8217;s specifications. It was entirely different from the city both in material and in purpose. It was a full type of Christ in human nature mingled with the Godhead. The ark included His redemption. (The Hebrew word for pitch, which covered the ark, is the same as the word atonement.) Thus the ark portrays Christ with His redemption.<p>Following the flood, Noah did not attempt to build a city. Rather, he lived in a tent and erected an altar to serve God (Gen. 9:21; 8:20). This was a miniature of the coming tabernacle which God was seeking.<h2 class=head2>Babel, Sodom and Abraham</h2><p>Not long after the flood, Noah&#8217;s descendants fell into Satan&#8217;s hands. They were formed as one body and utilized by Satan to build the second city (Gen. 11:1-9). Babel was Satan&#8217;s second counterfeit of God&#8217;s building. God completely frustrated and judged Babel.<p>Out from the fallen people of Babel, God called and separated Abraham (Gen. 11:29-12:5) and brought him to an elevated place called the land of Canaan. There God asked him to build an altar. Abraham also lived in a tent, while he served God through the altar (Gen. 12:7-8). This is an example of that which God is seeking. However, Abraham&#8217;s companion, Lot, drifted away from this position into another city. Lot was separated from Babel, the city of idols, but he drifted into Sodom, the city of sin (Gen. 13:12-13). He is typical of many Christians today. On the one hand there is the danger of living in the city of idols, and on the other hand the danger of drifting into sin. From an elevated position, Lot could either fall into Babel on his right hand or drift into Sodom on his left. A man standing on a plain, though he falls to the right or the left, is relatively safe; but in an elevated place he must exercise care. If I am standing on a table, I must be careful. From an elevated position, the danger of a fall is increased. Lot drifted from this position into Sodom, a city full of sin. But Abraham was kept from falling; he lived in a tent with an altar. His son Isaac (Gen. 26:25) and his grandson Jacob (Gen. 33:18-20; 35:7, 21) did the same.<h2 class=head2>Jacob&#8217;s Dream-Bethel</h2><p>God revealed His purpose for a building more clearly to Jacob. Jacob had become a wanderer in the wilderness with no home and no rest. But one night in his wandering he saw in a wonderful dream a ladder set up with its base on this earth, a base which could be called the house of God or the gate of heaven. He saw the thing which brings heaven and God down to this earth (Gen. 28:11-22). Praise the Lord, on this earth there can be such a gate of heaven. We need not go to heaven: here on this earth the gate of heaven can be realized. Such a place is called Bethel, the house of God. How wonderful that God could have a house on this earth!<p>The Scripture&#8217;s first mention of the house of God was in Jacob&#8217;s dream. My hope is that we all may have such a dream. Oh, may we all see that presently on this earth there is the possibility of having the house of God!<p>I received much teaching as a youth from many dear Christian teachers concerning this earth as a foul and Godforsaken place. I was taught that God&#8217;s intention is to build something in the heavens. In due time, I was told, we will all be brought to our heavenly home, there to be built up by God, while the whole earth will pass away. However, if we say that the earth will pass away, we must realize that the heaven also will pass away (Matt. 24:35; Heb. 1:10-12). Indeed, Scripture clearly states that we will have a new heaven, and we will also have a new earth. And in this new environment. God will not be in the new heaven, but will come down to this new earth. The New Jerusalem will descend out of heaven (Rev. 21:2, 10). You may prefer to go to heaven, but God prefers to come down to the earth.<p>Praise God that Jacob had such a dream, that even on this rebellious, usurped earth there is the possibility for God&#8217;s house to stand. We must believe that in every city today it is possible to have a Bethel-God&#8217;s house. Let us not be misled by the erroneous teachings which say that it is all wondrously in the future and in the heavens, that we cannot have a proper church life on earth today. We cannot find any such teaching in the New Testament. Contrariwise, the Scriptures tell us of a church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), a church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), a church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), a church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1), and most of the other cities the Apostles visited. But there is not a single mention of a church in heaven. We must abandon these teachings. The church must be established on this earth as God&#8217;s Bethel, God&#8217;s expression. Oh, may we have such a dream! We are just like Jacob: we have been wandering long enough. It is time that we stop our wandering and see the house of God established on this earth, even in every city. Hallelujah, it is possible! You can have a prevailing and proper church life in your city, but you must continually dream about this possibility of having God&#8217;s Bethel on this earth.<p>Bethel is not only a place, but also a stone. The stone upon which Jacob rested his head is indeed interesting. Jacob set up that stone and poured oil upon it, saying, &#8220;This stone shall be God&#8217;s house [Bethel]&#8221; (Gen. 28:22). The house of God is not just a place, but a stone, upon which oil is poured. It is amazing how such a &#8220;supplanter&#8221; had this wisdom. Only God could have inspired him with this. Jacob&#8217;s act and words correspond completely with the entire revelation of Scripture. Oil is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is the last person of the Godhead, who comes and mingles Himself with us. The pouring of oil upon that stone signifies God being poured upon His creation.<p>As God&#8217;s creation, we human beings were originally made of clay; we were not a stone. When Peter recognized the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, the Lord told him: &#8220;Thou art Peter&#8221; (Matt. 16:16-18). What the Lord meant was that Simon must have his name changed to Peter-a stone. This proves that by believing in the Lord Jesus we may be changed in our nature, changed from clay into stone.<p>The Apostle Peter in his Epistles later revealed that the Lord Jesus is the living stone, and that we also are living stones to be built up together as the house of God (1 Pet. 2:4, 5). We have been changed in nature. Originally we were clay, but today in Christ we are stones. In Adam we are clay, but in Christ we are stones. Jacob&#8217;s act of pouring oil upon that stone signifies the pouring of the Triune God upon regenerated people. Such is Bethel, the house of God. Whenever and wherever there is a group of regenerated persons poured upon with the Triune God, that is the reality of Bethel, the house of God. This can take place upon this earth today. Oh, do not look for a way to go to a future house of God in the heavens! Claim it today on this earth. Stand upon the dream of Jacob. His dream must be our dream. Tell the Lord: &#8220;Lord, I am part of this dream. I claim that even on this earth today, even in my city, You must have a Bethel.&#8221; Remember, Bethel is just a group of real believers anointed with the Holy Spirit and built together, believers who have been regenerated and transformed from pieces of clay into living stones, anointed and built into one by the Triune God. Oh, may we realize such a clear vision concerning the house of God!<p>The main points concerning Jacob&#8217;s dream are: firstly, the possibility that on this earth the house of God can be realized; secondly, the oil poured upon the stone to make it God&#8217;s house, signifying God being poured upon His people to build them together as His dwelling. Jacob, as Abraham&#8217;s third generation, saw God&#8217;s complete vision concerning His building more clearly.<h2 class=head1>IN EXODUS</h2><h2 class=head2>Pharaoh&#8217;s Treasure Cities and the Israelites</h2><p>God&#8217;s enemy, Satan, however, will not tolerate this vision being fulfilled by man. So Jacob&#8217;s very descendants departed from the place allotted to Jacob. In his dream Jacob was told by God that the land whereon he slept would be given to his children and that they would be a people in that place. But the city of Babel was on their right, Sodom on their left, and Egypt at their back. They were in a very dangerous and precipitous situation. They made their choice: all of Jacob&#8217;s children went down into Egypt, where they became slaves to build Pharaoh&#8217;s two treasure cities (Exo. 1:1-11). Jacob&#8217;s children did not return to Babel or fall into Sodom; they did not go back to idol worship nor enter into a sinful situation; they went to Egypt. For what purpose? To eat! They had to make a living, to have some enjoyment, some security in life. We must learn from their example. So many Christians today have been delivered from idol worship and kept from sinful things, but it is rather difficult to be preserved from falling into the state of simply pursuing a living. If I were to ask a fellow Christian why he wants to go to Los Angeles and he replies that it is to obtain employment, then he is exposed. He should be able to say quickly and boldly, &#8220;I am going to Los Angeles for the Lord&#8217;s purpose.&#8221; If otherwise, he is going into Egypt! Los Angeles becomes his Egypt.<p>Oh, the poor Christians today who are just out for a living, for their personal welfare! They are not involved in Babel (idolatry), and they have not fallen into Sodom (sin), but neither are they in the land of Canaan, the land which God had promised to Jacob and his descendants. They have been usurped and occupied by the King of Egypt, the prince of this world. Satan has enslaved them over the matter of their appetite and their personal enjoyment. So many Christians are enslaved by the enemy for the sake of a living; they are not free from the enjoyments of this world. Thus they are not in Canaan, God&#8217;s promised land. In Egypt, Pharaoh forced the children of Israel to work day by day in mud, to gather straw and stubble to burn the mud into bricks-all for the building of Pharaoh&#8217;s treasure cities.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Deliverance and Separation for His Building</h2><p>One day God sent Moses to command the children of Israel to go forth and serve God. When Moses informed Pharaoh of God&#8217;s word, however, Pharaoh&#8217;s officers were commanded to press the Israelites even more strenuously, that they might not have time to consider going forth to serve God. He accused them of idleness and forced them to work more rigorously for the treasure cities (Exo. 5). But thank the Lord, first by His redemption, and second by His salvation, God brought His people out of Egypt (Exo. 12 and 14) to the place where they could build Him a tabernacle (Exo. 19-25).<p>We must be clear where we are today. If we look at the whole picture from an over-all, bird&#8217;s-eye view, we will be clear. We will see that the only proper place for us is to be built up as a local, corporate body to express God and to represent God. And in order to experience such a building, we must be separated from Babel, Sodom, and Egypt-the world of idols, sins, and enjoyment-to a place where we can build God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>We must have the experience of &#8220;Exodus.&#8221; Exodus means &#8220;out of something...&#8221; The Israelites were a group of people who came out of something. They were brought out of all satanic counterfeits. If you view the scene from on high, you will see all the satanic counterfeits: Babel, Sodom, and the treasure cities. Praise God that the children of Israel were separated, delivered out, and kept away from all these counterfeits. They were brought to a position where they were available for the building of God.<h2 class=head2>The Building of the Tabernacle</h2><p>Following Noah&#8217;s ark, the next building of God was the tabernacle. The ark was full of significance, but it was not as full in detail as the tabernacle, the all-inclusive type of God&#8217;s building.<p>When the Israelites were brought out of Egypt, their first need was to contact God. Thus, Moses ascended a mountain, where he dwelt in the presence of God for forty days and nights. Oh, if we mean business with the Lord concerning His building in these days, we must go into His presence! We must learn to go up to the Lord on the mount; we must do some climbing. We must learn to stay in the Lord&#8217;s presence, fellowshipping with Him for some time. Then we will realize the meaning of His eternal building; we will know what God is seeking today. We will see that it is certainly not what today&#8217;s fallen Christianity is doing.<p>During Moses&#8217; extended period of fellowship with the Lord, God instructed him: &#8220;Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering&#8221; (Exo. 25:1, 2). God wants our offering, our consecration. Consecration always follows fellowship. When you fellowship with the Lord, you must tell Him, &#8220;Lord, I, all I have, and all I can do, are here available for You. Lord, everything is ready; point out what You want and I will give it to You.&#8221; After you have been freed from the usurpation of Satan&#8217;s counterfeits, you must go to the Lord and spend much time fellowshipping in His presence. During such fellowship the Lord will reveal that you must consecrate to Him all that you are and all that you possess. You must bring an offering to Him. You must not consecrate according to your own imagination, but according to God&#8217;s direction. Whatever He points out, you must release to Him.<p>There was a mother once who seemed to love the Lord. She had three sons. One day her third son, the weakest and dullest of her boys, came and offered himself in my presence to become a &#8220;preacher.&#8221; Upon questioning him I discovered that the mother had decided that the eldest, the most clever son, should study to be a medical doctor; that the second and less intelligent son should pursue a career in commerce; and finally, that this boy, the least intelligent, was to be &#8220;offered to the Lord.&#8221; She felt he was only good enough to be a &#8220;preacher.&#8221; Oh, that poor mother! We do not have any ground to choose what we will consecrate to God. The Lord will point out what we must offer.<p>The Lord indicated to Moses the offerings that He desired. The Lord always wants the best. So many dear Christians love the Lord, but with some reservation. They hold back the best for themselves. We really do not have a choice; we must let God point out what He wants. He will choose all the things which fit His purpose: gold, silver, brass, and eventually the onyx stones (Exo. 25:3-7).<p>Notice the sequence in the items which God requested: gold, silver, and lastly, onyx stones. This means that from the first to the last everything is precious. If it is precious to you, it is even more precious to the Lord. The Lord never desires what you do not want. If you discard something, the Lord will say, &#8220;Forget it, I don&#8217;t want it either. I want exactly what you want!&#8221; If I were an Israelite listening to Moses convey God&#8217;s instructions, I would shrink back and even exclaim in fear, &#8220;Gold, silver, onyx stones? Oh, these are too precious to me!&#8221; Here is the test of our consecration.<p>I am not speaking of the doctrine or theology of consecration. My burden is to show why after the lapse of over two thousand years there is still no real building for God on this earth today. It is because some Christians are still in Babel, some are still in Sodom, and many, many others are still being usurped by the King of Egypt. Some Christians, it is true, have been separated from Egypt, yet they are not abiding in the presence of the Lord to seek and realize His desire. Still others, who have been in the presence of the Lord, will not yield to His requests or demands. They will not open their hearts to offer all the best things to the Lord. This is the problem today. Without this offering, how can the building of God come into being? Do you realize that God needs you, including all that you are, all you have, and all you can do? Will you bring all into His presence and say, &#8220;Lord, here, everything is available; You point out anything, and I agree to give it to You.&#8221; Have you seen that from the gold to the onyx stone, including all the items in between, everything God asks for is precious and the best? If these kinds of offerings are brought to the Lord by us today, His building will be realized.<p>God further said to Moses, &#8220;Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle...even so shall ye make it&#8221; (Exo. 25:8-9). God&#8217;s desire is to have a dwelling place on this earth. He has planned this; He has a pattern, a pattern according to His pleasure. We must know this; we must realize that God&#8217;s intention in the universe is to have a dwelling place built among His people and with His people on this earth. The building up of the local churches today is God&#8217;s desire. If we are people after His heart, we will give our full attention to this matter, to the building of the churches today on this earth as God&#8217;s dwelling place, according to God&#8217;s pattern, the pattern shown by God&#8217;s revelation. When the tabernacle was erected, God&#8217;s glory covered it and filled it (Exo. 40:17, 34). Through such a building God could express Himself on this earth. This is what God is seeking all the time.<h2 class=head1>IN THE REMAINING BOOKS</h2><p>When the tabernacle was built, it became the history of Israel&#8217;s journeys. For forty years the Israelites concentrated on that tabernacle. Eventually, after many wanderings, they entered Canaan, bringing the tabernacle with them into that land and establishing it there (Josh. 18:1). There they fought many battles, subdued the enemy, and gained the ground-all for the purpose of building an enlarged and more solid dwelling place for God. We remember how David desired to build the temple for God. He was told, however, that the time was not ripe; there still remained some enemies to be subdued. This proves that all the fighting and subduing of the enemy was for the gaining of the ground that God&#8217;s temple might be built.<p>When the temple was erected, it became the center of Jewish history. Later, the Babylonians came and destroyed the temple, bringing the Jews into captivity (2 Kings 25). But after seventy years, God initiated a recovery and brought the Israelites back to the proper ground that they might rebuild the temple (Ezra 1). This type of situation was repeated until the time of Christ&#8217;s first advent.<p>Throughout New Testament history, Christ Himself is the tabernacle and the temple on this earth (John 1:14; 2:21). God&#8217;s enemy came to destroy Christ by putting Him to death on the cross. But the Lord Jesus told the Jews-those people utilized by Satan-&#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (John 2:19). By resurrection Christ built the temple again-not merely His physical body, but His mystical Body, the church. From that time, the church is the temple of God, and as such it is the very subject of the remainder of the New Testament. Christ is the subject of the first part, and the church is the subject of the second part of the New Testament. Eventually, following the dispensation of the church, the New Jerusalem will be God&#8217;s ultimate building, God&#8217;s eternal dwelling place, which is also called &#8220;the tabernacle of God&#8221; (Rev. 21).<p>This concludes our bird&#8217;s-eye view of the whole of Scripture. The building of God is the central matter of the entire Bible. Can you afford another view of Scripture? If so, I&#8217;m afraid it will not be the main view. Oh, may we not be distracted from the main view!<p>We must see the vision of God&#8217;s building from a high mountain. Otherwise, we will be lost in a maze of minor things. God brought both Moses and the Apostle John to a high mountain that they might have a bird&#8217;s-eye view and be so clear concerning God&#8217;s central desire. We also must go on high that we may see the whole scene and not be lost in some of its corners. Not only in Genesis and Exodus, a total of ninety chapters, but also throughout the entire Scriptures, we see one thing: God is after a building on this earth where He may rest and express Himself.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg> THE EXPERIENCE OF THE OUTER COURT</h1><p>In the previous chapter it has been made clear to us that the tabernacle as God&#8217;s dwelling place is the center of everything. With a bird&#8217;s-eye view we realize that three kinds of cities are in opposition to this tabernacle of God. In contrast to God&#8217;s building we have seen Satan&#8217;s counterfeits. He intervened firstly to build the city of Enoch, and later attempted to erect the city of Babel. Out of the realm of Babel, the realm of idolatry, God called Abraham, the first forefather of the builders of the tabernacle. When Abraham was separated from the realm of Babel, he was in a position to attain the goal of God&#8217;s building. He was also kept from the sinful city of Sodom, though his nephew Lot drifted into that city. By living in a tent, Abraham took the position of looking forward to the city which has foundations, the New Jerusalem, which is the very tabernacle God will eventually build up in this universe. Abraham&#8217;s position of separation from Satan&#8217;s cities was not a doctrinal standing. It was an intensely practical stand for the real, future building of God.<p>Neither Abraham, his son Isaac, nor his grandson Jacob would build a city or live in a house; they were all satisfied to dwell in tents. They looked for that city with foundations, the New Jerusalem, God&#8217;s tabernacle that was to be built. They expected to move from their tents into that eternal tabernacle, of which their tents were but a very small shadow.<p>However, their descendants, the children of Israel, fell in another direction. They went to Egypt to satisfy their appetites. They were enslaved by Pharaoh and forced to build two cities of worldliness, treasure, and enjoyment. But God mercifully redeemed them through the passover and saved them by the deliverance of the Red Sea. God&#8217;s redemption and salvation brought these fallen people out of the cities of worldliness and back into a proper position for God&#8217;s building. By God&#8217;s deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, the children of Israel were finally free from all of Satan&#8217;s counterfeits. God brought them into His presence at Mount Sinai in the wilderness, where they saw His glory and heard His voice. This is the first record in Scripture of any group of persons abiding so deeply in the presence of God. Man could enjoy God&#8217;s presence because he was separated from all the satanic cities.<p>The Israelites were not only freed from bondage, they were also spoiled for anything other than God&#8217;s building. They were no longer good for Babel, Sodom, or the treasure cities of Egypt. They no longer had anything to do with them. Day by day they dealt with the tabernacle of God; they beheld the glorious cloud and listened to the voice. In one sense they were jobless-they had no stores, factories, or farms. They had nothing but the glory of God and the voice of God. Continually, from morning to evening, they dealt only with God and His dwelling place. Day and night they talked only about God and His tabernacle. This was real freedom; a freedom from all Satan&#8217;s counterfeits of idolatry, sins, and worldliness; a release unto the presence of God and His building.<p>Our first need today is to be separated from idols. Secondly, we must be preserved from sins. And thirdly, we must be delivered out of worldliness. Then we are in the position of being available for God&#8217;s building.<p>The tabernacle is the first full picture of God&#8217;s building in the Scriptures. Concerning the tabernacle there are three main parts: the outer court, the holy place, and the holiest of all. Whenever a person enters the tabernacle, he must pass through the outer court. Within the outer court there are two things: the altar and the laver (Exo. 40:29-30).<h2 class=head1>THE ALTAR</h2><p>The altar is the place where all the offerings are offered. Its essential meanings are judgment, redemption, and consecration. When the Israelites offered anything to the Lord, it must be brought to the altar. Everything they offered had to pass through the altar; it had to be killed and burned upon the altar. This signifies judgment. As a Christian you may feel that you have offered yourself quite properly to the Lord. Yes, God needs your offering, but His first demand is that you put everything on the altar. He must judge you by death and by burning. This may seem a frightening prospect, but we must realize that all that is natural about us must be judged. God can never accept the natural man or his living as material for His building. All we are, all we have, and all we can do must be judged by the altar. The altar typifies the cross. We must be checked and judged by the cross.<p>This is the proper Christian experience: as we spend time in the Lord&#8217;s presence in fellowship, we will have the sense that the Lord asks us to offer all that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do. Thus, we offer all to Him. But then we will sense that we are sinful, fallen, evil, and corrupted; that we are fleshly, soulish, and natural. We will sense that we are certainly not good for God&#8217;s building. We must be put on the cross! Praise the Lord, we have already been put on the cross!<p>We must realize the reality of the death of Christ-this is the real judgment. Such a realization means on one hand that God demands our life and all we have to be offered to Him. But on the other hand it means we realize that we are good for nothing but death and that we have already been put on the cross. Through consecration we realize that we have been completely ended, that we have been put on the cross. This is the experience of passing through the altar, the real experience of the cross.<p>A brother came to me once and said, &#8220;Last night I had a dream, and this morning I went before the Lord. I have seen that the Lord wants me. Now, I&#8217;m a little clever in certain things which could be a real help to the building of the church. So this morning I am burdened to come and tell you that I have offered myself to the Lord for the building of the church.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Brother, on one hand this is wonderful, but on the other hand it is awful. When you offer yourself in such a way to the Lord for the building of His church, it is dreadful!&#8221; He was greatly disappointed and exclaimed, &#8220;Am I not good enough?&#8221; I answered, &#8220;Brother, you are good for nothing but death! Forget your cleverness-you must throw that in the ocean. The Lord does not need your cleverness. That must be put to death; that must be judged. Your clever mind must be put upon the altar. In fact, you must put everything on the altar.&#8221;<p>No Israelite could possibly enter into the tabernacle without first passing through the altar. Should he attempt to do so, he would immediately perish. All of us, in fact, must die, either on the altar or within the tabernacle. It is better to die on the altar, on the cross, rather than in the tabernacle. Only the Lord can testify how many times I have said to myself, &#8220;You must die; you must be put on the cross; you must realize that you are already put on the cross.&#8221; Do not think that you are smart. God&#8217;s building does not need smart or stupid people, but only those who have been put on the cross, those who have been killed and burned on the altar, those who have been checked, judged and disposed of.<p>The second meaning of the altar is redemption. Praise the Lord! Whatever God judges, God redeems. Redemption comes through judgment and issues in resurrection. Whatever you put to death, God will raise up in His redemption. You just put yourself in the position of death. Don&#8217;t worry about the next step. The Holy Spirit will bring you into life. You put yourself on the altar, and the Holy Spirit will bring you into the tabernacle. God redeems what He judges. Redemption realized through judgment must be experienced by us; it is not a matter of theology.<p>The third meaning of the altar is consecration. After redemption, the Lord immediately demands another consecration. We need to experience consecration continually, from the first step to the last. Step by step, before judgment and after redemption, we need to be consecrated. In every situation, we should be constantly aware that we are a consecrated people. This is the real meaning of the altar. All things brought to God must be put on the altar, judged, redeemed, and consecrated. It is only after passing through the altar that everything will be truly consecrated to God. Nothing can belong to God or really be of God until it passes through the altar. You may have offered yourself to the Lord, but have you passed through the cross? Have you experienced the resurrection and the reality of consecration? Do you have such an altar in your daily life? From the picture of the tabernacle we see that the reality of God&#8217;s building is not possible without the altar being first experienced by us. The experience of the altar must precede everything. All the rest is based upon this.<p>Now notice the measurement of the altar. It is foursquare, five cubits wide by five cubits long, and it is three cubits high. The number five signifies the creature (four) plus the Creator (one) to bear responsibility for the fulfilling of God&#8217;s requirements. The ten commandments and the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1-13) are divided into two groups of five. All these signify responsibility to fulfill God&#8217;s requirement. The foursquare measurement of five by five gives the sense of the complete fulfillment of God&#8217;s requirements in full responsibility. The number three signifies the Triune God. It signifies the responsibility and the fulfillment of the altar. The cross of Christ comes up to the standard of the Triune God. The cross of Christ has fulfilled God&#8217;s requirements. And by our experience of the cross, we fulfill the requirements of God.<p>Thus, we must realize that at the altar and by the altar our being dealt with by God must come up to God&#8217;s standard in the full responsibility and fulfillment of God&#8217;s requirements. This was so with the Lord Jesus on the cross, and it must be so with us in our subjective experience of the cross. If we would enter the building of God, we must first fulfill all the righteous requirements of God. Anyone or anything brought into the building of God must pass through the altar in this way.<h2 class=head1>THE LAVER</h2><p>The next item in the outer court is the laver. But before sharing the meaning of the laver, we must indicate in this connection that the altar was overlaid with brass. The source of this brass was the brazen censers of the two hundred and fifty Israelites who rebelled against God and were judged by fire. The Lord instructed Moses to gather all these brazen censers and make from them brass plates to overlay the altar (Num. 16:38-40). This, of course, imparts the sense that the brazen altar is for judgment by burning. It is significant that the laver is also made of brass. However, this brass had its source in the mirrors of the women who served at the tabernacle (Exo. 38:8). The purpose of a mirror is to reflect our true image and thus to expose us. Sometimes when we ask our children to wash their faces, they reply indignantly that they are quite clean. It is helpful, then, to take them to a mirror and let them see for themselves. Even so, the laver of brass exposes and enlightens us. We immediately sense the need of cleansing, and it is the laver which also cleanses us (Exo. 40:30-32). This is the real work of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). We must be exposed and then cleansed from our fallen state.<p>The type of brass used in the laver differs from that used in the altar, but the nature of both is the same. This means that the Holy Spirit&#8217;s exposing or enlightening depends on the judgment of the cross. The laver of brass follows the altar of brass. From the brass altar there is the brass laver. Spiritually speaking, this means that the laver&#8217;s function issues from the altar. Judgment always brings light to us. When we are judged, we are enlightened. The more we are judged by the cross, the more the Holy Spirit enlightens and exposes us. If we do not apply the cross to ourselves, we will always say, &#8220;I am all right, there is nothing wrong with me.&#8221; If we have this attitude, the Holy Spirit will never expose us. We will simply remain in darkness. When we apply the cross, saying, &#8220;Oh, I am so sinful, I am good for nothing but death, I must be put to death, and I have already been put to death,&#8221; immediately the Holy Spirit exposes us from within. He points out that we are wrong in this matter, corrupted in that matter, and defiled in many other things. The more we apply the cross, the more we will be enlightened by the Holy Spirit. The laver follows the altar-both are of brass. At the brass altar we have the experience of being judged; at the brass laver we have the experience of being enlightened and cleansed. We must judge ourselves-this is the only way to experience the building of God.<p>No one can tell us the size of the laver. The exposing, enlightening, and cleansing work of the Holy Spirit is unlimited and immeasurable. Concerning all the utensils of the tabernacle, only two are without measurement-the laver and the lampstand. Both are immeasurable and unlimited.<p>The vital problem and main issue today is that all we are, all we have and all we can do must be put on the altar, must be put on the cross. For when we are thus judged, redeemed, and consecrated, we will continually be in the position where the light may shine upon us. The Holy Spirit will constantly expose, enlighten, and cleanse us. When we pass the brass altar and the brass laver in this way, we really experience God&#8217;s judgment. This is the first experience of God&#8217;s building. We are good for nothing but judgment, and we must realize this judgment.<h2 class=head1>THE BRASS SOCKETS</h2><p>From the experiences of the altar and the laver, we go on to the experience of the brass sockets (Exo. 27:10-17). These are the bases of the wall of the outer court. All the pillars which support the hangings of the outer court rest upon these brass sockets. In spiritual experience this means that the foundation, the base of the wall of the outer court, comes out of the judgment of God. After we pass the cross and the exposing and cleansing work of the Holy Spirit, we will lay the foundation of the wall of the outer court. This constitutes the boundary line of God&#8217;s building. All things outside of this line do not belong to God&#8217;s building. When we experience the brass altar and laver, we see the brass sockets laid as a foundation, drawing the boundary line of God&#8217;s building. From our experience of being judged and cleansed comes the foundation of the outer court, the sockets of brass. In the record of the specifications of the tabernacle, the mentioning of the brass altar precedes the mentioning of the brass sockets. Spiritually speaking, this means that the sockets come out of the altar. We must first experience the dealing of the cross, and the exposing, enlightening, and cleansing of the Holy Spirit. We must experience these items extensively; then we will have the foundation laid as the boundary line for God&#8217;s building. By this line we may separate what is within from what is without God&#8217;s building. By this line we may clearly discern what must be kept without, what should not be brought within. The boundary of God&#8217;s building is the judgment of the cross and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit. Anything belonging to the building of God must be judged by the cross, exposed and cleansed by the Holy Spirit. Otherwise it is outside the building. Anyone who thinks he is clever and adequate for God&#8217;s building has not judged himself, and has no boundary line. When there is no separating line, no outer court, then the whole world will be the outer court for the building of the church. That is wrong! We must have the separating line-the judgment of the cross and the exposing and cleansing of the Holy Spirit. This is so clear.<h2 class=head1>THE PILLARS</h2><p>Upon the base of the brass sockets we have the pillars (Exo. 27:10-16). No one can tell the composition of the pillars of the outer court-it is a mystery. However, on the pillars are the silver hooks and the silver fillets, or connecting rods (Exo. 27:17). What is the meaning of these items? Again, based upon judgment, we have redemption. Judgment brings redemption, and redemption comes by or with judgment. In typology, silver always signifies redemption.<h2 class=head1>THE HANGINGS</h2><p>Upon the hooks and pillars of the outer court were the hangings (Exo. 27:9-15). These hangings were just like drapes. They were made of twined linen, very strong, pure, and clean. In typology, linen signifies righteousness (Rev. 19:8). This means that we have judgment, redemption, and righteousness in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the people. By our experiences of the altar and the laver, everything is cleansed and adjusted; so everything is right and just. This is the way we obtain the righteousness, the white linen, as the separating wall of the outer court of God&#8217;s dwelling place, testifying the full righteousness of God among His people. When the hangings are set upon the pillars of the sockets, those beholding the tabernacle from without see something white, pure and clean. This is the separating border line, setting us apart for God&#8217;s expression, God&#8217;s building. There must be such a separating line of righteousness based upon God&#8217;s judgment and redemption as a testimony of God&#8217;s righteousness to the sinful world.<p>All the hangings were five cubits high and were divided by the pillars into sections, each in the measurement of five cubits by five cubits (Exo. 27:18, 9-10, 11-12, 14-15). The hangings on the north and south sides were both one hundred cubits long with twenty pillars. Those on the west side, that is, at the rear, were fifty cubits long with ten pillars. And those on either side of the front entrance were fifteen cubits long with three pillars. Thus, all the hangings were divided into foursquare sections of five cubits by five cubits, corresponding with the size of the altar. This signifies that all the hangings correspond with the righteous requirements of God fulfilled upon the altar. Thus, they stand as a testimony of all that is accomplished on the altar. The foursquare top of the altar in the measurement of five cubits by five cubits covers the ground of God&#8217;s requirements. The foursquare sections of the hangings in the same measurement stand as the testimony to all that is covered and accomplished by the altar. When we have been dealt with by the cross, our daily living and walk will be a testimony to the work of the cross. In our daily lives and walk there must be such pure and white hangings as a testimony to those without. All we are and all we do must correspond with the work of the cross. Then we will be fit for God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>PURGING IN THE OUTER COURT</h2><p>For the realization of God&#8217;s building, for the practice of the church life, people must be dealt with and purged in the outer court. The Israelites, who would be built up together as God&#8217;s building, were fallen people. Once they had fallen into the world of idols; then they were related to the world of sins; eventually they became enslaved in the world of treasure and enjoyment. Now they were separated from all these to be materials for God&#8217;s building. The first step in their building was that they must be judged and purged. By judgment they could be redeemed, and by redemption and purging they could become clean, pure, just and right-right with God and right with man.<p>But although the Israelites were brought out of all the sinful and worldly cities, they still remembered their past; they remembered the onions and garlic of Egypt and retained their taste for these things. In the wilderness they became disgusted with the heavenly manna and said, &#8220;This is tasteless. Day by day we are eating the same things! Let us return to Egypt, to the tasteful enjoyments. We are fed up with this simple food.&#8221; This is the picture of today&#8217;s Christianity. We have all come from such a corrupted and evil background; we are full of all kinds of evil. So we must be judged and killed, cleansed and purged by the experiences in the outer court. These experiences erect the boundary line which separates and keeps us from idols, sins and worldliness. The work of the cross and the work of the Holy Spirit keep us from these things. We must experience the brass altar-the cross-and the brass laver-the cleansing of the Holy Spirit. We must be dealt with by the cross and purged by the Holy Spirit; then there is the possibility for us to share in the building of God.<p>Notice that the outer court is outside of the building. It is not until we have passed through the outer court that we may enter into God&#8217;s building, the tabernacle itself. This is not a matter of doctrine, but something to be experienced. Why are so many Christians not experiencing the proper building of the church on this earth today? Because some are still in Babel, Sodom, or Egypt. Some have indeed departed from these evil realms, but they are still full of idolatrous germs, sinful germs, and germs of worldly enjoyment. In the so-called churches of today, one can sometimes hear the announcements of pleasures and amusements. These are the germs. It is impossible to have a proper church life in this way. The reason for this is that so many have not experienced the dealing of the altar and the purging of the laver. Thus, there is no foundation laid for the boundary line.<p>God&#8217;s building must have a definite boundary line. Within that line everything belongs to His building; outside of that line everything belongs either to Babel, Sodom, or the treasure cities. Today&#8217;s fallen Christianity does not have the proper, necessary boundary line. Such a boundary has never been built up; it has never been drawn. The people are still participating in idols, sins, and treasures of worldly enjoyment. They have never experienced the brass altar and the brass laver. They have never been judged and been put to death on the altar or cleansed and purged by the laver. If we would practice the church life and share in the building of God, we must first experience the brass altar with the brass laver. Then we will have the brass sockets laid as the foundation of the boundary line. It is by such experiences that the boundary line of God&#8217;s building is drawn.<p>In the outer court we realize and experience the cross, by which everything is judged, put to death and burned. Here, with the cross, we also experience the working of the Holy Spirit to expose, enlighten, cleanse and purge us. Everything which does not correspond with God and God&#8217;s righteous way must be judged and purged away. All the worldly pleasures and enjoyments must be excluded from God&#8217;s building. They must be terminated and purged. We must experience the judgment of the cross with the purging of the Holy Spirit. Then we will be a proper and right person, right with God and with man. We will have the righteousness as typified by the white linen hangings on the pillars set upon the brass sockets as the boundary line of God&#8217;s testimony. Within this boundary line there is the possibility for us to realize the building of God and practice the church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLY PLACE</h1><p>We have seen that if we would share in the building of God we must first enter into and experience all the items in the outer court. But the experiences of the outer court deal only with the matter of righteousness; we must still have the experience of holiness. The items which we have covered in the outer court merely establish the boundary line for God&#8217;s building; they are not the actual building of the tabernacle itself. We must still experience the tabernacle, God&#8217;s very building. In the outer court are the brass, the silver, and the white linen, depicting God&#8217;s judgment according to His righteous requirements, God&#8217;s redemption, and God&#8217;s righteousness. But these only prepare us, making us fit initially for God&#8217;s building. Now we must enter the tabernacle itself, that is, we must enter the holy place.<p>When we enter the holy place, we are immediately impressed that everything is of gold. There is a lampstand made of pure and solid gold, and all the other items in the holy place are overlaid with gold. Gold is everywhere!<p>Strictly speaking, God&#8217;s building was built through brass, but not with brass. It was built with gold. Gold typifies God&#8217;s divine nature, that is, God Himself. His building is built through His judgment, but not with His judgment. The material of God&#8217;s building is God Himself. We must have God&#8217;s divine nature in order to be the materials for God&#8217;s building. How may we partake of God&#8217;s divine nature? By spiritually experiencing the holy place.<h2 class=head1>THE SHOWBREAD TABLE</h2><p>The first item of the holy place is the table made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:23, 24, 30; 40:22-23), upon which was the bread, something good for food. This table spread with bread typifies Christ as our heavenly food; we may feed on Christ and enjoy Him as our food. The Gospel of John portrays Christ as the bread of life, so available to us. If we take Him in the form of food, we share the divine life with the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4).<p>We have seen that immediately after man was created, God put him before the tree of life that he might freely eat of that tree. This means that God presented Himself to man in the form of food. Most of us have a mistaken concept concerning God. We consider that He is so high and mighty and that we must bow and worship, prostrating ourselves before Him. But God wants us to take Him as food. He desires that we partake of Him inwardly more than worship Him outwardly.<p>As a youth, I was taught after I was saved that I should be very quiet at the so-called Holy Communion table. I was told that we must remember Jesus by concentrating all our thoughts in meditation upon Him. But later, as I read the Scriptures, I discovered that I had not been taught properly. The Lord told us, &#8220;Take, eat: this is my body, this do in remembrance of me&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:24). When we take Him by eating of Him, we are really remembering Him. The true remembrance of the Lord is not our meditation upon Him but our eating of Him, our partaking of Him. God&#8217;s intention is to work Himself into us. We must consider Him as our food and partake of Him.<p>The Lord Jesus is our heavenly bread of life. By eating this bread, something of &#8220;gold&#8221; will be ours. Whenever we partake of Christ as food, the divine nature is wrought into us. In this heavenly bread of life are the &#8220;vitamins of gold.&#8221; Little children are often fooled by the &#8220;candy&#8221; given them by their mother. They do not realize that they are actually taking candy-covered vitamins. Mother&#8217;s intention is fulfilled in a pleasant way. Our thought is that since we are really hungry, we need the Lord Jesus to satisfy us; so we fulfill our desire by eating the bread of life. But God&#8217;s intention is to impart through the bread the &#8220;gold.&#8221; When we are satisfied with Christ, we will also be full of the divine nature. We can verify this by our experience of the Lord. Whenever we are satisfied with the Lord Jesus, we also have the sense that we are full of God, that the divine nature has been imparted to us.<p>The measurement of the showbread table is two cubits long and one cubit broad. The number one stands for a whole unit. If the table were foursquare, one cubit by one cubit, it would signify a complete unit; but here it is two cubits long. This signifies a double unit, a double portion, that the table may be spread for people to enjoy. The height of the showbread table is the same size as that of the ark of testimony, one and a half cubits. This means that Christ as our food must come up to the standard of the testimony of God.<h2 class=head1>THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p>The second item in the holy place is the lampstand (Exo. 25:31-39; 40:24-25). It is full of shining light. Christ is the bread of life, and John 1:4 tells us that this life is the light of men. When we receive Christ as the bread of life, light immediately shines within us. The life becomes the very light. When we have been fed with the bread on the table, we have a lampstand shining within us. When we are hungry for the Lord and pray-read a few verses together, praise the Lord, we are nourished and satisfied, and with this satisfaction we also have something shining within us. The more light we have, the more divine nature we have. There is not any wood in the lampstand-it is solid gold. God&#8217;s divine nature comes into us by shining (2 Cor. 4:6).<p>Upon the lampstand were six branches, with three on either side and one in the middle, and upon each branch were three cups, each in the shape of an almond blossom. Each almond blossom had a knop or calix. The calix is the green, petal-like leaf, the outer part of a flower (see the Berkeley Version). Thus, each cup of the lampstand was an almond blossom, an entire flower. In Palestine, the first flower of the year is the almond blossom. Following the killing chill of winter, the almond gives forth the first blossom. This flower signifies the resurrection. You remember that Aaron&#8217;s rod, mentioned in Numbers 17, budded with almond blossoms, signifying resurrection. The number three, as seen in the number of branches on each side of the lampstand and the three cups on each branch, is the number of resurrection-the Lord was resurrected on the third day. Branches on both sides of the stand signify a testimony, since two is the number of testimony. Therefore, the lampstand is the testimony of resurrection.<p>There are also a total of seven lamps on the stand. These signify the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5; 5:6). The seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of Christ. This means that Christ as the Spirit is the light of life in resurrection. Christ could only be the light of life in resurrection as the Spirit. All these things are very meaningful to us. We must study the Scriptures in this way. It was into the cups of the branches of the lamps that the priests put oil. The flower of resurrection holds the oil. This means that the oil for light is in resurrection power. The light must be in resurrection, and resurrection is with the Spirit. The light issues from the seven Spirits, which are the seven eyes of Christ. Christ does not look at us with two eyes, but with seven eyes. He looks upon us by the seven Spirits of God, as seven lamps. An automobile at night &#8220;looks&#8221; at others by shining its headlights as two shining eyes. When Christ looks upon us, it is just like the shining light. The book of Revelation tells us that His eyes are as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14). Christ can only be life and light to us in resurrection and as the Spirit. In other words, Christ is the light of life to us as the Spirit of resurrection.<p>On each branch of the lampstand there are three cups, but on the shaft, the stand of the lamp, there are four cups. Four signifies creation. Without these four cups, we could find no hint in the lampstand that Christ has anything to do with His creatures. But, praise the Lord, we have these four cups. Christ as the Spirit is the light of life in resurrection, but He still has something to do with the creation. Christ Himself is a part of the creation, even the firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). Thus, He is also represented in the number four. All these things are exceedingly meaningful; we can never exhaust them. First Christ is the bread of life; then this life becomes the light, shining in resurrection with the Spirit.<p>Notice now that there is no measurement specified for the lampstand. It is immeasurable and unlimited.<h2 class=head1>THE INCENSE ALTAR</h2><p>Following the lampstand in the holy place is the incense altar, upon which sweet incense is burned to God (Exo. 40:26-27). The incense altar is closely related to the lampstand. When the priests dressed the lampstand in the morning and lit the lamp in the evening, they had to burn the incense (Exo. 30:1-8). This signifies that the lighting of the lamp is vitally related to the burning of the incense.<p>What does the burning of the incense signify? Whenever we are enlightened by Christ, we must turn to God in prayer. This is not a matter, however, of ordinary prayer. This is a kind of inner utterance to God with a sweet odor. Such prayer is the fragrant odor of Christ in resurrection, which is so pleasing to God. Whenever we are enlightened by Christ within, we spontaneously turn to God and express something from within. We have a sense then that we are pleasing to God, that we are fragrantly sweet to God. This is the burning of the incense.<p>The incense is Christ Himself in resurrection as our acceptance to God. God accepts us in Christ. Oh, may we realize that whenever we eat Christ, enjoying something of Him, on the one hand we are satisfied, but on the other hand we are enlightened by His shining within us. It is by this shining then that we express something to God in a sweet sense-that is Christ in resurrection as the sweet odor to God. God accepts us in the resurrected Christ. In Him we have sweet communion with God, and we are acceptable to God.<p>The measurement of the incense altar is foursquare, one cubit by one cubit. We have seen in the measurement of the showbread table that a foursquare measurement of one cubit signifies a complete whole, an absolutely perfect unit. The sweet incense of the resurrected Christ is absolutely perfect in the eyes of God. It could not be more perfect. The height of the incense altar, however, is two cubits. This means a double unit, a double portion, by way of ascension. The showbread table was spread horizontally in a double unit for our enjoyment, but the incense altar is built up vertically in a double unit; it is in an ascending position, signifying enjoyment for God.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMATION IN THE HOLY PLACE</h2><p>It is by all these experiences that we are overlaid with gold, the material of God&#8217;s building. Through these experiences we become suitable material and actually become part of the building. Prior to the experiences of the inner court, the most we had was brass, silver, and linen; we had nothing of gold. And prior to the experience of the outer court with its fine linen, we had only the clay and filth of our fallen nature. Through the work of the brazen altar and laver we were purged and purified from everything of Babel, Sodom, and the treasure cities of Egypt. We were made white linen, the righteousness of God; we were made right with God and with man. However, we had nothing of gold until we learned to enjoy Christ, until we took Him into our very being day by day as food. Then, the more we eat Him, the more light we receive; and the greater the light, the more fragrance we have to offer to God. By such experiences we are overlaid with gold, the divine nature of God. We must be thoroughly overlaid with God as gold. It is only possible as we feed on Christ and enjoy Him as the bread of life, as we are enlightened by Him as the light of life and made acceptable to God in the fragrance of His resurrection. We must truly experience Christ in this way, rather than merely listen to teachings about Him.<p>For many years the Lord has been keeping me in the constant practice of entering the holy place to enjoy Christ. The more we enjoy Him as the bread of life, the more He becomes the light within, enlightening us and turning us to the Father to express the sweetness and fragrance of Christ. There need not be any separation, any kind of veil, between the Father and us. We may experience the sweetness of Christ to the Father, and we may also experience His sweetness to us in the fragrance of His resurrection. By this blessed presence and acceptance before God, we are spontaneously overlaid with the divine gold.<p>Partaking of God&#8217;s divine nature has absolutely nothing to do with endeavoring to correct our conduct. When we try to improve our behavior outwardly, we are still in the outer court. We must go on to experience Christ within the tabernacle. We must leave the outward correction and enter into the inward enjoyment of Christ. It is then that we experience an inward mingling of Christ with us. We must experience Christ in this way. Within the tabernacle we are never conscious of good or evil; our only thought is to enjoy the bread of life. We are fully and completely occupied with Christ as our enjoyable food. The more we thus enjoy Him, the more life we have. And the more we experience Him as life, the more we are enlightened by Him. Such an increase in life causes more fragrant communion with God. Thus we are more fully overlaid with God in Christ as gold.<p>In the outer court we have God&#8217;s righteousness, but in the holy place we have God&#8217;s holiness. God&#8217;s holiness is God&#8217;s nature, even God Himself. Only God is holy. There is nothing common with God. When we are overlaid with the divine gold, we also are holy. To be holy means to be divinely &#8220;golden.&#8221; In the outer court we are right with God and with men. Everything is right-all wrong has been done away on the cross and cleansed away by the laver. Yet we are only righteous, we are not holy. Within the holy place, however, it is not a matter of the cleansing of sin and defilement, but a matter of partaking of the bread of life, of enjoying Christ firstly as the life, then as the light within us, and eventually as the fragrance to God. Have you had such experiences of Christ? I must confess that I experience the Lord in such a way every day. Day by day I feed on Christ, enjoy something of Him, and sense the enlightening within me and the sweet odor towards God. Spontaneously I say, &#8220;O Father! My dear God!&#8221; How sweet it is! Such prayer is the burning of incense to God. It is only in this way and at such a time that our prayer becomes incense, for it is then that we are in the light and in the Spirit of resurrection. When we enjoy Christ in such a living way, we are overlaid with gold. Our intention is to enjoy Christ as food, light, and fragrance to God, but God&#8217;s intention is to add more of His divine nature into us, to overlay us with more gold. Thus we are made fit for God&#8217;s building.<p>God&#8217;s purpose is not fulfilled merely by judging us, purging us, and delivering us from the negative things. We have seen the steps for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s full intention outlined in Genesis 1 and 2. All these reveal God&#8217;s original intention and purpose to make man the proper material for His building. The judging and the purging are only to deal with the negative things resulting from man&#8217;s fall. If man had never fallen, there would be no need for this. After man is purged, God intends to go on to fulfill His original plan.<p>First we must be dealt with and purged from satanic forces, sins, and worldliness in the outer court. Then we may enter the holy place to enjoy Christ. We no longer try to adjust our outward behavior, but deal inwardly with Christ day by day. We enjoy Him as our food, our life, our light, our incense, and our everything. By this we are transformed in nature.<p>It is easy to help Christians realize they must abandon idolatry and sins, but it is not so easy to help them see how worldliness keeps them from God&#8217;s purpose. It is even more difficult to help Christians differentiate between the correcting of their outward behavior and the inward enjoyment of Christ. If we could only be brought from the place of outward adjustment to the constant, inner enjoyment of Christ, we would experience great deliverance. When we enter the holy place, we know nothing but the inward enjoyment of Christ.<p>As Christians we must press on to enter into the holy place. We should not be satisfied merely with being righteous in outward conduct and behavior. We should not be content with the fine linen of righteousness in the outer court. We must proceed into the holy place to enjoy Christ Himself as food, life, light, and sweet incense. Such experiences in the holy place greatly transcend those of the outer court.<p>It is God&#8217;s intention that we proceed from the negative work of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit in the outer court into the positive experiences of Christ at the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the holy place. God uses the outer court to recover us by purging us from our fallen condition. But this dealing with the negative things is just the beginning. We must go on to positively enjoy Christ in the holy place as the life with the constant inner shining, bringing us into sweet communion with God. By such experiences of Christ in the inner life we will be transformed for the building of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLIEST OF ALL</h1><p>Our experiences of Christ in the holy place are all good, yet they are still not adequate. Between the holy place and the holiest of all we are confronted with the problem of a veil (Exo. 26:33). The veil signifies the flesh (Heb. 10:20), the self. The idols have been terminated, the problem of sin is past, and the entanglements of worldliness have been abandoned, but our self is still with us! God has four major enemies: idols, which symbolize evil spirits or satanic forces, sin, worldliness, and self. As Christians, we may be delivered from the first three, and we may be presently enjoying Christ as everything to us. But what about our self? Most of us must admit that it has not yet been broken.<p>Many times we use the very Christ whom we enjoy as an element to glorify ourselves. We feel: &#8220;Now I am such a wonderful person; I am so full of Christ. I know Christ as my life, my food, my light, and my incense to God. Christ is my everything!&#8221; But it is all &#8220;I, I, I&#8221;-the terrible self! We are still very shallow. Though we are enjoying Christ so much, the big problem now is the self.<h2 class=head1>PERFECTION IN THE HOLIEST OF ALL</h2><p>Consider the picture in Exodus carefully. It is not till we enter the holiest place of the tabernacle and there experience the ark that we could be a proper board, a board which is overlaid with gold on every side, a board which is good for the building of God. Only the boards of the ark are overlaid with gold on both sides. The table of showbread in the holy place is only overlaid with gold on one side. In the holy place the overlaying work has not been fully accomplished. We must go on to experience the ark that we may be perfected by being overlaid with the divine gold within and without. Then we will be the proper and adequate material for God&#8217;s building. We must be perfected; we must become like the boards of the ark. The boards used to build God&#8217;s tabernacle correspond exactly to the boards of the ark. This signifies that it is only as we experience the ark that we are the adequate boards for God&#8217;s building. In other words, until we attain the experience of the ark, we are not perfected and available for the building. Although many Christians talk much concerning the church life, strictly speaking, they are not available material for the church.<p>The boards of the tabernacle itself are produced by our experience of the ark, for both are completely overlaid with gold. The principle is the same as that which we have seen in the producing of the brass sockets for the foundation of the outer court. That foundation came from the experience of the brass altar and the brass laver. Now we must go on from the outer court, through the holy place, and into the holiest of all that we may be brought forth as the boards for God&#8217;s building. It is only in the holiest of all that we are perfected and fully available for God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO ENTER THE HOLIEST OF ALL</h2><p>How may we go on from the holy place and enter into the holiest of all? By having the self broken and put to death! Our troublesome self must be dealt with, denied, and broken! The veil which separates the holiest of all from the holy place must be riven. Then we may enter into the holiest of all and enjoy Christ more fully.<p>The separating veil typifies our flesh, our old, fleshly nature. Just as the veil must be riven, so our fleshly nature, our self, must be broken that we may enter the holiest place. Our self, our old man, has already been crucified with Christ on the cross (Rom. 6:6). Thus, it is through the cross that entry into the holiest of all is made possible. We must apply the cross of Christ to ourselves. We must realize that we ourselves are the separation hindering us from entering into God&#8217;s holiest place. Our self must be crossed out! The old nature must be fully abandoned! The old man must be broken! It is by the practical experience of the Lord&#8217;s death, by the practical application of the cross to our troublesome self, that we may enter into the holiest place to share Christ as the very embodiment of God as typified by the ark.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ARK</h2><p>The ark is the sole content of the holiest of all (Exo. 40:20-21). This means that in the holiest place of God&#8217;s presence there is nothing but God&#8217;s Christ as the all-inclusive embodiment of God. The experience of the holiest of all is nothing but the experience of such a Christ. In the holy place we experience Christ as food, light, and fragrant incense; but deeply within the holiest of all Christ is the ark of testimony, a deeper and richer Christ for us to experience. Within the ark is the testimony of God, the law of God (Exo. 25:16, 21). This testimony contained in the ark represents God in a total way. God could not make an image to represent Himself, for then the Israelites would worship this image as an idol. So God gave the law, which is His very picture, the definition and explanation of Himself. The law within the ark signifies the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). The ark typifies Christ, and the law within the ark typifies the embodiment of God. Thus, in the holiest of all we have Christ as the embodiment of God.<p>We must experience Christ not only as life, light, and incense, but also as God&#8217;s embodiment. A one-year-old believer may experience Christ as life, but he does not as yet have much awareness of Christ as the embodiment of God. He may realize that Christ is God, yet he has not experienced Him as the embodiment of God. However, the more we experience Christ as our food, our light, and our fragrance to God, the more we will begin to deeply sense that we are experiencing God Himself in Christ. Christ is not merely life, light and fragrant incense, but God Himself. The more we experience Christ, the more we will sense that this Christ whom we are experiencing is the very embodiment of God. He is the fullness of God and the testimony of God. The law hidden within the ark signifies that we must deeply realize Christ as the reality of God.<p>Many of us have had numerous experiences of Christ as food, life, light and incense, but not many have experienced Christ as God&#8217;s embodiment. It is extremely difficult to explain this deeper experience.<p>Let us refer to one item of the law, God&#8217;s testimony, as an example. Consider the commandment to love others. Apparently this is God&#8217;s commandment to us. But if we are in the holiest of all, we will realize that this is not really a commandment, but an element of what God is in Christ. Love for others is the very essence of God&#8217;s being. Oh, if we touch this reality and share in this reality, we will spontaneously have a life of loving others! We will no longer try to obey the commandment to love, for it will be a reality in our life. This is but a simple illustration of experiencing Christ as the embodiment of God.<p>In the holy place we enjoy Christ in many ways, but once we experience the brokenness of the self, the flesh, we enter into the holiest of all. Then we realize the reality of God in Christ. We will then no longer enjoy Christ alone, but have the realization of how real God is in Christ in every way. This is something deeper. From such an experience, everything we do and express will become easy and spontaneous. We will not attempt to keep any commandments. We will have touched the reality of God in Christ.<p>It is at this very ark in the holiest of all that we meet God. Strictly speaking, God does not meet us at the brass altar and laver, or even at the showbread table, lampstand, or incense altar. God only meets us at one place-the mercy seat (Exo. 25:21, 22). It is there we realize how real God is to us in Christ. It is by this deep realization that we are wholly at rest. At the mercy seat we not only enjoy Christ as this or that to us, but Christ as God&#8217;s embodiment, with all the fullness of God.<p>Before entering the holiest place, a Christian must first be delivered from all negative things-idolatry, sins, and worldliness. Then, even from the good things of righteousness, he must go on to enjoy Christ in the holy place. Eventually, he must leave the self and the flesh that he may enter into the holiest place to experience the fullness of God in Christ. In the holiest of all we do not know nor do we care about anything but God in Christ. We certainly will not be distracted by idols, be ensnared by sins, or fall into worldliness. And we will certainly be delivered from our self. We will simply enjoy God as being so real to us in Christ.<p>The experience of the cross and the Holy Spirit&#8217;s purging work is on the negative side. We must go on to experience the positive side-Christ as food, life, and everything to us. Yet this experience is still shallow compared to the experience of God as the very reality in Christ. This is the deepest experience. When we experience the ark and the holiest of all, we are delivered from all other things. Nothing else matters to us. God in Christ is everything. Madame Guyon says that the realization of spiritual experiences will eventually bring us to the point where we are lost in God. Only God in Christ through the Spirit will be everything to us as our reality.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTENTS OF THE ARK</h2><p>In the holy place there are three main things: firstly, Christ is the bread upon the table; secondly, He is the light from the lampstand; and thirdly, He is the sweet incense, the acceptance to God, from the incense altar. Hebrews 9:4 tells us that in the holiest of all, within Christ as the ark, there are also three things: the hidden manna, corresponding to the bread; the hidden law which enlightens us, corresponding to the light; and the hidden rod, sprouting with almond blossoms, corresponding to the incense of the golden altar in the matter of acceptance. Only Aaron was acceptable to God; therefore Aaron&#8217;s rod sprouted with almond blossoms. The almond blossoms signify resurrection. This means that God accepted him in resurrection.<p>In the holy place everything is open, but in the ark everything is hidden. In the holy place the bread was called the showbread, signifying something openly displayed. But in the ark it becomes the hidden manna, something deeper. In the holy place there was the lampstand with the light shining forth. But in the ark the law was hidden, which signifies the law speaking in a hidden and deeper way. From the incense altar the fragrance ascended outwardly. But in the ark the sprouting rod was hidden. The experience of the ark in the holiest of all is much deeper than the experience of the things in the holy place. This is also proved by the ark being overlaid with gold within and without. Both the showbread table and the incense altar were overlaid with gold only on the outward side. That means that the overlaying of gold was to a lesser degree and more shallow. The overlaying of gold upon the ark is greater and deeper, signifying that the experience of Christ here is greater and deeper than before.<p>Suppose we meet two new Christians who have just been baptized. They have both experienced Christ as their living bread, and they love to come to the meetings and show Him forth to others. They testify: &#8220;Oh, we have enjoyed Christ so much this week!&#8221; Two sisters who were baptized with them are shining with the light they have received from the Lord. They also testify and shine forth in the meetings. All four have experienced Christ in the holy place, and now they express Him publicly in the meeting. If the Apostle Paul were to attend the same meeting, however, I do not think that you would so easily recognize him as a Christian. He would sit there quietly with no outward display. However, if you were to converse with him later you would be amazed. You would wonder where on earth he came from. Something within him is so rich, so hidden. You could not observe so much outwardly, for with him, everything is hidden.<p>The priests in the holy place must dress the lampstand in the morning and light it in the evening. But there is no need to attend thus to the hidden law. It is always there speaking. The new sisters who are so brightly shining in the meetings may appear next week with gloomy countenances. They are yet so shallow in their experience of Christ; they need a priest to dress and lighten them.<p>In the holiest of all with the ark we enjoy God in Christ as the hidden manna, as the divine, regulating law, and as the sprouting rod with resurrection power. Here we experience God in Christ in such a deep and rich way. He becomes so real and rich to us as the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden resurrection power within us. This is the uttermost experience of Christ, the very climax of spiritual experience. At this point, we are fully and wholly mingled with God; we are overlaid with God as the gold in everything and in every way. The two natures, divinity and humanity, are mingled as one.<h2 class=head1>THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ARK</h2><p>The dimensions of the ark are completely in half-sizes. The size of the brass altar was five by five by three cubits (Exo. 27:1). The ark, however, is two and a half, by one and a half, by one and a half cubits (Exo. 25:10). Its dimensions are one half those of the altar. What is the significance of this? When we see a half of a watermelon, we automatically surmise that there must be another half somewhere. In principle, this is the meaning of the ark of testimony. A testimony requires two witnesses. The ark needs another &#8220;half.&#8221; Thus, the ark&#8217;s dimensions of half sizes impart the meaning of testimony.<h2 class=head1>AN EXPERIENCE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>When we carefully consider this wonderful picture in Exodus, we know where we are. The more we experience Christ in a deeper way by rejecting and denying our self, the more we will be in our spirit, which is the holiest of all today. When we are thus in our spirit, God will be so real to us in Christ, in the Holy Spirit. It is not a matter of teachings or doctrines which are real to us, but something within our spirit. It is not just an inward enjoyment to us, but an inward reality.<p>From our deep experience of Christ as the ark in the holiest place of our spirit, we have the reality of nourishment from the hidden manna, the enlightenment of the divine law, and the empowering of the sprouting rod. These realities are deeply within us in our spirit. The manna, the law, and the rod are not outwardly displayed, yet they are so real. We will not have words to utter, and we will not need to utter this divine reality of the fullness of the Godhead in Christ in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE</h2><p>We have seen how the ark is overlaid within and without with gold, signifying something more of Christ. When we experience Christ in a deeper way, we are overlaid with God in Christ inwardly as well as outwardly. Christ, as the embodiment of God, covers us within and without. Later we will see how the tabernacle is built up with boards which are overlaid with gold on every side, just as the ark. This means that the tabernacle issues out of the experience of the ark. This is proved in Exodus by the mentioning of the ark before the tabernacle (Exo. 25:10-22; 26:15-30). The outer court issues from the experiences of the brass altar with the brass laver, but the tabernacle issues from the experiences of the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. When we are overlaid within and without with God&#8217;s divine nature, when we are totally in God and saturated with God in Christ, we are then the proper materials, available for the building of God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>All these things are just a picture of the proper way for us to practice the church life today and have the building of God. We must pass through the altar and the laver, we must experience Christ as life, light, and fragrance to God, and we must deeply experience Christ as the very embodiment of God. We must go on from the outer court, through the holy place, into the holiest of all to have the full experience of Christ with God in our spirit. Then all the old nature, the old self, will be put to an end on the cross, and our total enjoyment will be Christ, only Christ-Christ as life, as light, as everything, and as the very embodiment of God. Then we will be overlaid with God, thus becoming a board overlaid on every side with the divine gold. And then we become the very material for the building up of God&#8217;s dwelling place. This is the proper way to have the real church life, the real building of God!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg> THE BUILDING OF THE TABERNACLE</h1><p>We come now to the tabernacle itself, God&#8217;s very building. According to the record of Exodus, it is clear that the tabernacle itself is brought forth from the experiences of all the items within it, items such as the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar and the ark of testimony. We have seen that these items represent Christ as the bread of life, as light, as incense, and as the very embodiment of God. We must experience Christ to such an extent if we would be part of God&#8217;s building. The more we experience Christ, the more we are overlaid with the divine gold, the nature of God. We have seen that the ark, the last item of the tabernacle&#8217;s interior, was overlaid both within and without with gold. This proves that when we experience the ark, our human nature, typified by the acacia wood, is absolutely covered by the divine nature, as typified by the gold. Humanity is completely overlaid with divinity.<h2 class=head1>THE BOARDS</h2><p>The boards of the tabernacle issue from the experiences of the items within the tabernacle and are the main part of the building itself. Without the boards, the tabernacle could not be erected. If we know how to view this impressive picture, we will realize that the boards are the reproduction and enlargement of the ark. The ark is Christ, the incarnated Son of God. On one hand He has the divine nature, and on the other hand He has the human nature. The divine nature is mingled together with the human nature as one. This very One is God&#8217;s embodiment and God&#8217;s testimony, the ark. The boards, then, as the reproduction of the ark, are the church. The ark is Christ and the reproduction or increase of the ark is the church. The church is the enlargement of Christ, the increase of Christ, exactly the same in nature as Christ.<p>There is only one Christ, so there must be only one ark. But the boards are many. There are twenty on the north side, twenty on the south, six at the rear and two at the corners (Exo. 26:15-25). Altogether there are forty-eight boards. The number forty-eight is composed of six times eight. Man was made on the sixth day; therefore, six is the number of man. The number of the antichrist is six hundred and sixty-six (Rev. 13:18). This means too much man, too much humanity, and this is very bad. The number eight signifies a new beginning, another start, and this is resurrection. Thus, the forty-eight boards signify that all those related to the church building are human, yet they are resurrected. The building is composed of humanity in resurrection. There are forty-eight boards, but there is only one tabernacle. We Christians are many, yet we are one body, one church (1 Cor. 10:17). And this one church is the increase of the ark, the enlargement of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARDS</h2><p>These things are a precious revelation, but now we come to a very practical matter-the composition of the boards. Each board is composed of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Therefore, their composition clearly reveals two distinct things of two distinct natures united together. In typology wood signifies human nature. But acacia is a superior kind of hard wood; it is not a sub-standard wood. It is in contrast to our grain, our human nature. We are extremely loose, but acacia is very solid, hard and strong. Acacia wood typifies the resurrected, uplifted, and strengthened human nature. We must have the human element or human nature for the church to be built, but this human nature must first be put to death. Then it must be resurrected, uplifted, and  strengthened.<p>As members of the church, the first requirement is that every bit of our human nature must be rejected. Not a particle of it is welcomed by the church. Indeed the church requires human beings, but our human nature is not needed. It is good for nothing but burial. Whenever a new person comes into the church, the first occurrence should not be a wedding, but a funeral. When we come into the church, we must agree to be buried in baptism. Baptism signifies burial, a riddance of one&#8217;s self. But in God&#8217;s redemption, death is not the end. Death is the process which leads to resurrection. Oh, do not be afraid to be buried in Christ, for through death you will be resurrected! The first requirement of the church life is that we must reject ourselves. But praise the Lord, within us is the Spirit of resurrection! The Holy Spirit will be responsible to resurrect us, to uplift us and strengthen us. The more we experience the denial of the self by the cross of Christ, the more we will be uplifted. We will no longer be so natural, but live and act in resurrection.<p>These experiences produce the building up of spiritual character, which is the resurrected, uplifted, and strengthened human nature. As a Christian in the church life, we should be exceedingly strong, yet not naturally strong, but spiritually strong. In the resurrected human nature, we should be as strong as acacia wood. Many brothers and sisters are loose, and some even appreciate their looseness. They say, &#8220;We must be loose to be acceptable to others; to be strict causes others to think we are cold and rather unpleasant.&#8221; No! One requirement which is absolutely necessary for the building up of the church is that our human nature be resurrected, uplifted, and strengthened, even as the acacia wood.<p>The second constituent of the boards of the tabernacle is the gold, overlaying the wood. We must all be so overlaid by God that we lose ourselves in the divine nature. Those who view the boards of the tabernacle see only gold. The boards themselves are intrinsically wood, but the manifestation of the boards is golden. We should be strong, but not strong in ourselves. We should be patient, but not patient in ourselves. We must be able to say, &#8220;Praise the Lord, my manifestation, my expression, is not myself, but God. I am a wooden board, but my manifestation is golden!&#8221; As human beings we must not manifest our natural human nature, but something divinely golden. Our natural human nature must be put to death, buried, and resurrected. We need a full experience of Christ. The more we experience Him, the more we will be overlaid with the divine nature till eventually the entire board is covered by the glorious gold. Then the appearance and expression of all the boards will be golden.<p>The church is composed of many different men, including Americans, Chinese, Japanese, Germans, etc. But praise the Lord, there is no American, Chinese, Japanese, or German nature in the church. The total expression is divine. We are all overlaid, covered, and hidden; the wood is hidden in the gold. This is exceedingly vital, for as we shall see later, without this overlaying gold we can never be united (Exo. 26:26-29). In ourselves we are separate and independent boards, but when we are overlaid with gold, we are united together as one. Our peculiar human natures could never be united. The unity of the church, the oneness of the saints, is not in the human nature, but in the divine. Praise the Lord, the overlaying gold, the golden rings, and the golden bars unite us. How much have you been overlaid with gold?<p>Good brothers are nice, but golden brothers are necessary. Good brothers cannot further the building; in fact, they may even frustrate and damage the building. Many times the building up of the church is damaged more by the good persons than by the bad. Oh, we must be mingled with the divine nature; we must be overlaid with God! This can only take place by our experiencing Christ-there is no other way. When we experience Him not only as our life, our light, and our incense, but as the very reality and embodiment of God, then we will be full of God. We will be overlaid, saturated, and mingled with God. We will become wooden boards with a golden appearance, and we will be proper materials, available for the building up of the church.<h2 class=head1>THE BREADTH OF THE BOARDS</h2><p>Each board is one and one-half cubits wide (Exo. 26:15-16). This is exceedingly significant. The numbers three and five are the main numbers in God&#8217;s building, and one and one-half is half of three. This means that neither you nor I are a whole unit; we are just a half of a unit. We need another half to match us. When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them two by two: Peter was one and one-half, and John was one and one-half. When they were put together, they equaled three cubits, or a whole unit. We can never be independent; we must have someone else to match us. Many times when we observe a husband and wife, they look just like two halves of one whole. In the home, a husband needs his dear wife, but in the church he needs someone else to match him. The sending forth of the New Testament disciples two by two clearly reveals that they were not individualistic persons, but members one of another. Not one individual Christian is a whole body. We are but members, and we need other members to match us. The primary factor in the church life is that regardless of what kind of person I am, I am still only one and one-half cubits wide. Someone may be as big as the Apostle Paul, but he must still remember that he is only one and one-half cubits. Most of us believe that the Apostle Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians alone. However, if we look closely, we will see that someone else, one who is unknown by most Christians, was his other half writing with him (1 Cor. 1:1). The Apostle Paul was not independent; he did not write in an individualistic and uncoordinated way.<p>We must be definitely and practically related with other Christians. This is why there were forty-eight rather than forty-seven or forty-five boards in the tabernacle. There was an even number, not an odd number. We cannot have any odd brothers or sisters in the church; we must all constitute an even number. Thus, we must constantly realize that we in ourselves are not complete; we are just half a unit. We must always be related to someone else. For many years I have never dared to act in an individualistic way. Praise the Lord, under His authority I have always had some brother or sister to match me. We must be matched with others.<h2 class=head1>THE TENONS</h2><p>Every board has two tenons (Exo. 26:17). This is quite interesting. Why do we have two feet rather than one? It is because with only one foot a person would be unbalanced, unstable, and without confirmation. Likewise, a board may easily turn on just one tenon, but with two tenons it is fixed. Many brothers are indeed precious, but they turn so easily. They are constantly turning. Last week they were so positive toward the Lord, but this week they have changed, they have turned. Oh, there is no turning with God! (James 1:17). The reason many dear Christians are continually turning is because they have one tenon instead of two. With two tenons we are always balanced and fixed.<p>If you are such a turning brother, you had better find another brother to be a tenon to you. You are short of one tenon; so you must borrow a tenon from someone else. Whenever you begin to turn, you must seek fellowship and confirmation from your brother. Go to him and ask whether or not he agrees with what you are doing. If he does not, then you must not turn. Learn to have another tenon and be confirmed by others.<h2 class=head1>THE SOCKETS</h2><p>The two tenons are fixed in two sockets (Exo. 26:19, 21, 25). Each board, therefore, has two tenons fixed in two sockets. Each socket weighs one talent of silver, or approximately one hundred pounds. That means that under each board there is a base of two hundred pounds. It is impossible for a board to turn or fall with such a base. Thus, each board is exceedingly stable and fixed. Yet there is something more.<h2 class=head1>THE RINGS AND BARS</h2><p>Upon the gold overlay of each board there are rings, and through the rings are bars joining all the boards together (Exo. 26:26-29). There are five bars on each side connecting the twenty boards. It is indeed interesting. Note how these five bars on each side of the twenty boards are arranged. A single bar extends from one end of the twenty boards to the other and is the middle bar of the five bars. The other four bars are divided into two broken rows of two bars each, with one row above and the other row beneath the middle bar. Thus the five bars are arranged in three rows. Again we see the numbers three and five. Three signifies the Triune God, and five is the number of the creature plus the Creator to bear responsibility. Therefore, the uniting power of the church is the Triune God mingled with the creature. The bars, which signify the uniting Holy Spirit, are made of wood overlaid with gold. Not only is there wood within the boards, but there is also wood within the bars. This signifies that in the Holy Spirit, who unites us together, there is also the human element. This is very meaningful.<p>In chapter five of Andrew Murray&#8217;s book, The Spirit of Christ, there is a statement concerning the Spirit of the glorified Jesus. He says there that the Holy Spirit is not only of the divine nature, but also with the human nature. Hence, wood is used in the type of the uniting Holy Spirit, because He is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of the glorified man, Jesus. Included in the Spirit of Jesus today are the divine nature and the human nature. Today, the Holy Spirit of Christ is such an all-inclusive Spirit! It is this Holy Spirit, the Spirit with both the divine and human nature, that unites the saints together.<p>The boards of the tabernacle are not united by the wood, but by the gold. If the element of gold were removed, all the boards would fall apart. In the boards alone, there is no oneness. The unity is in the gold, in the divine nature. The rings typify the Holy Spirit in regeneration, the very initial experience of the Holy Spirit. The bars are the uniting Holy Spirit, with both the divine and human natures. The bars unite all the parts together as one body. When we remain in the divine nature, in Christ, in God, then we are one. The unity of the church is in the divine nature, in God and Christ as the Spirit.<p>There are three groups of bars: one on the north side, another on the south side, and the last on the west side, at the rear of the tabernacle. Again, this typifies the three persons of the Godhead. The expression of the Triune God is continually seen in the tabernacle, God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE PILLARS</h2><p>On every side of the tabernacle are the boards, except in the front, the east side. In front are the pillars, with a veil or curtain (Exo. 26:31-32). If there were boards on all four sides, the tabernacle would be entirely closed. That would be too exclusive! There would be no entry or exit. Most members of the church are boards, but some must be the pillars. Chapter 2 of Galatians tells us that Peter, James and John were the pillars or the stronger ones in the church at Jerusalem. Because the pillars are stronger than the boards, the entrance to the tabernacle is through them. If people would enter, the pillars afford the way. There must be stronger brothers as pillars in the church life; there must be those who afford an entrance. If some would come in, the entrance opens; but if there is the need of protection, the entrance closes. A wall is a fixed structure; no one can pass through it. It is suitable for protection, but it is not available for an entrance. A door, however, may be opened to afford entrance, or it may be closed to protect those within. It may be opened to allow people to enter, or it may be closed to keep people out.<p>Praise the Lord for the entrances in the church. There are twelve gates in the New Jerusalem. There must not only be the boards as walls, separating and protecting, but also the pillars which afford the entrance. Many brothers are sufficiently strong to be boards, but we need stronger brothers, more experienced brothers, brothers who are not so square, but a little rounded, to stand as strong columns for the entrance.<p>In some so-called churches there are neither boards nor pillars. There is no separating power, no protection, and no entrance. In other places, there are too many boards; all four sides are walled up. They are protected to the point of exclusion. There must be the pillars to balance the church.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUNDATION</h2><p>At the bottom or base of the tabernacle there are one hundred silver sockets (Exo. 26:19, 21, 25, 32), totaling one hundred talents or about ten thousand pounds in weight (Exo. 38:27). These silver sockets afford an extremely solid structure. Silver, as we have seen, signifies redemption. God&#8217;s dwelling place among His people must be based upon the Lord&#8217;s redemption. It could only be solid in this way.<p>During the time of Exodus there was no floor in the tabernacle. The building of God was not as yet established in a permanent location, but was involved in journeys and wanderings.<h2 class=head1>THE COVERING</h2><p>The covering over the tabernacle consisted of four layers (Exo. 26:1-14), which signifies the four-fold Christ, the Christ of four aspects. The first layer, of fine linen, typifies Christ as the sinless One. He had no sin and knew no sin. The second layer was a layer of goats&#8217; hair. In typology, the goats signify sinners, while the sheep signify justified persons (Matt. 25:31-46). Therefore the layer of goats&#8217; hair reveals Christ as the One who knew no sin, but who was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21). This layer consisted of six pieces, one more in number than five, and something too much. The third layer consisted of ram skins dyed red, thus revealing the sinless One who was made sin and died for our sins by shedding His blood (1 Cor. 15:3). He is our redemption. The fourth layer of badgers&#8217; skins typifies the Redeemer as our protection. Badger skin is exceedingly strong and is thus able to protect from the heat of the sun, the assault of the rain, the blowing of the wind, and all kinds of attack. All these layers together signify the protection of Christ, who as the sinless One was made sin for us to be our Redeemer. This is the four-fold Christ, our covering.<h2 class=head1>THE TYPE OF THE CHURCH WITH CHRIST</h2><p>In conclusion, all we have seen in the building of the tabernacle is a portrait, a figure of the building of the church with Christ as its content. The church is a composition of many people who experience Christ to such an extent that they are mingled with God. Thus they become the wooden boards overlaid with gold and set in silver sockets. Thus they are also covered by the four-fold Christ as their protection. This is the church! In such a church Christ is the content. Within the tabernacle is the showbread table, displaying Christ as the bread of life; there is the lampstand, revealing Christ as the very light of life; and there is the altar of incense, portraying Christ as our fragrance and acceptance before God. Finally, there is the ark of testimony, setting forth Christ as the very embodiment of God. Such a Christ is the content of the church, and such a church is the expression of such a Christ.<p>I believe this impressive picture is quite clear. If we would practice the proper church life, we must realize and experience Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of such a Christ. Throughout all the centuries God has been seeking and is still seeking for such an expression. He desires such a building on this earth, even in your locality. The Triune God portrayed in these chapters is the reality of the local church. May the Lord in His mercy bring us all into such an experience.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>FROM THE END OF EXODUS TO THE BEGINNING OF FIRST SAMUEL</h1><p>In the previous chapters we have mainly covered the central thought of God&#8217;s building in Genesis and Exodus. In this chapter we will attempt to cover a large area, from the end of Exodus to the beginning of 1 Samuel. Such a vast scope requires a bird&#8217;s-eye view.<h2 class=head1>A NEW BEGINNING</h2><p>In Exodus 40, verse 2, the Lord commanded Moses, &#8220;On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.&#8221; This word of the Lord to Moses signifies a new start, a new beginning. Because the building of the tabernacle was completed, there was a new beginning. Verse 17 tells us that according to the Lord&#8217;s word, on the first day of the first month in the second year, the tabernacle was reared up. It was indeed a new start. In the first year, the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt-that was the new beginning in their history with the Lord (Exo. 12:2). Now that the tabernacle was reared up, they had another new beginning. It was the start of their history with God and His dwelling-place. Whenever there is a church built up in a certain place to fulfill God&#8217;s purpose, that is always a new beginning, a new start in the history of the Lord&#8217;s people. It is the sign that we are in the way of the Lord&#8217;s leading, that we are taking sides with the Lord, that we are under the Lord&#8217;s revelation and in His presence, and that we are ready to fight the battle for the Lord on this earth. May all the Lord&#8217;s people have such a new beginning in their history with God.<h2 class=head1>SIX MAJOR THINGS RELATED TO THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>From the rearing up of the tabernacle in Exodus to its capture in the beginning of 1 Samuel, there are six major things related to the tabernacle. They are vital to the history of the Lord&#8217;s people and worthy of our attention.<h2 class=head2>(1) The Tabernacle and God&#8217;s Glory</h2><p>The first of these six major things is that the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34-38). God&#8217;s glory on this earth can only be manifested in and through His building. When the tabernacle was completely set up, God&#8217;s glory immediately filled His building. The glory of God was in heaven, but at that time it appeared on the earth in the tabernacle. This was only possible because of the building.<p>The Lord is longing for local churches to be built up on this earth today, for wherever a local church is built, there the glory of God will be manifested. The manifestation of God&#8217;s glory on earth today wholly depends on the building. The manifestation of God&#8217;s glory is the very expression of God. The building of God is this expression, the very image of God.<p>The tabernacle, and later the temple as an enlargement of the tabernacle, were built for the purpose of expressing God. They were both the image of God. The city, which came later, was the representation of God&#8217;s authority. We have seen that God&#8217;s intention in creating man was that man might express Him on this earth by having His image and represent Him on this earth by having His authority. Later in history, the temple in the image of God was for the expression of God, and the city with the authority of God was for the representation of God. In other words, the temple is the house of God, and the city is the kingdom of God. The glory of God filled the tabernacle and later the temple. This means that they became the very expression of God, the glorious image of God. God is expressed in and through His dwelling-place. Whenever and wherever a local church is built, God&#8217;s glory will be manifested on this earth.<p>God told Moses to &#8220;rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting&#8221; (Exo. 40:2). Notice that there are two things mentioned here: the tabernacle and the tent of meeting. The tabernacle belongs to the tent of meeting. The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of God filled the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34). The tabernacle and the tent of meeting are one, but there is an inward aspect and an outward aspect. Inwardly speaking, this building is the tabernacle for God&#8217;s dwelling. But outwardly speaking, it is the tent of meeting for the assembling of God&#8217;s people. Inwardly it is God&#8217;s dwelling-place; outwardly, it is the meeting-place of God&#8217;s people. A real secret is revealed here which has vital meaning for us today.<p>On many occasions in the church life there is the tent of meeting without the tabernacle. God&#8217;s presence and glory fill the tabernacle; thus to be without the tabernacle is to be without God&#8217;s presence. If we have the tabernacle with the tent of meeting, then God&#8217;s presence is with our meeting. We must have both aspects. We must have the reality of God&#8217;s dwelling. It was in the tabernacle that God instructed Moses to put the ark; He did not say that it should be put into the tent of meeting. Whenever the church comes together, there must be the outward aspect of the meeting with the inward aspect of God&#8217;s dwelling in the meeting. Such a tent of meeting with the tabernacle is the very expression of God on this earth. What is your sense when you meet with other Christians? Do you just have the tent of meeting without the inward dwelling of the Lord? Oh, we must check ourselves in this first major point!<h2 class=head2>(2) The Tabernacle and God&#8217;s Speaking</h2><p>Firstly, God&#8217;s glory, God&#8217;s presence, is manifested in and through the finished building. Then, Leviticus 1:1 says, &#8220;The Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting.&#8221; Prior to this time, the Lord had always spoken to Moses in the cloud and in the fire on the mountain. But after the tabernacle was erected, God spoke in the tabernacle, in the tent of meeting. We must realize that God&#8217;s speaking is in and through His dwelling-place. In other words, God speaks in the church and through the church. From the time that God&#8217;s first dwelling-place was completed, God spoke in that building. Anyone desiring to hear the word of God must come to the tabernacle. This is exceedingly clear. If we would receive the word of God, we must come to the church. But the church must be one with the tabernacle and the tent of meeting. God must be in the church, speaking all the time.<p>We can personally testify and prove that when a local church is properly built, God is always speaking there. A Christian may spend much time in personal Bible study, but he can never receive such a living word from God as when he is in the church. The word spoken by God in His dwelling-place can never be substituted by any other kind of word. We must come to the church. We must be clear, however, that God&#8217;s living word is spoken only in the real building of the church, the real tabernacle. We do not want the old word, the old doctrine. We want the fresh, living word of God. Therefore, we must come to the real building of God to receive His word in full.<h2 class=head2>(3) The Tabernacle and the Priestly Service</h2><p>Leviticus is a book of service and the priesthood. The third major point is that the service of God is entirely related to the building of God. First Peter 2:5 says, &#8220;Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices&#8221; (King James Version). This word clearly reveals that the service of the priesthood is totally related to the building of the house of God. Following the words &#8220;spiritual house&#8221; there is a comma, with the words &#8220;an holy priesthood&#8221; following. This means that the spiritual house is the priesthood. Christians are the living stones which are built up as a spiritual house, that is, the priesthood. In the Old Testament, boards were used for the building of the tabernacle, and the priests served within the tabernacle. This gives the semblance of two categories of things. But in the New Testament, the living stones of the house, which correspond to the boards of the tabernacle, are the priests. The spiritual house and the priesthood are one and the same thing. The priests are the material of which the house is built. The priesthood is not an individual matter. All the priests formed together as one compose the priesthood. This is the house and also the priesthood. It is a corporate matter, a collective body. Strictly speaking, service to God is not an individual matter, but something of a corporate body. In typology, not one priest could serve God individually. All the priests served in coordination with one another as one body.<p>We must all realize that we cannot serve God by ourselves individually. We must serve in coordination with others. One stone can never be a house: it must be built up together with other stones to form a building. It is impossible for an individual Christian to constitute the priesthood. I can never be a house by myself; I must be built up with others. This means, strictly speaking, that if there is no building, there is no real service to God. How many Christians there are who think that as long as they love the Lord, they can serve Him individually, irrespective of the church. They take the attitude that they can serve the Lord regardless of whether the church is built up or not. This is wrong. It is only when we are built together that proper service can be rendered to God. Real service to God is something of the building.<p>Romans 12 speaks clearly of the Body of Christ functioning together in all kinds of ministries and services. Prior to this chapter, which introduces the Body life, there is no mention of service. This clearly indicates that the service of the Lord&#8217;s people must be in the Body, the building, the church. In principle, this is why the book of Leviticus follows Exodus. Exodus is a record of building, and Leviticus is a book of service. Service always follows building. If there were no tabernacle, there could be no priests to serve. They certainly could not minister in their homes, for real service is a coordination with others in the tabernacle, in the building of God. As Christians, we are individual persons, but we cannot be individualistic Christians. We cannot serve the Lord independently of others. Each individual priest must be coordinated with all the other priests. It is a dreadful thing to attempt to serve the Lord apart from the proper church life, apart from being built up with others. I have witnessed too many Christians attempting to do this. Eventually they failed God. We must be built together as the priesthood to serve God in the building, the church, in a coordinated way.<h2 class=head2>(4) The Tabernacle and the Army</h2><p>We come now to the fourth major point, which is in the book of Numbers. Most expositions of Numbers give the impression that it is a book of wanderings and repeated failures. This is not quite accurate. Properly speaking, Numbers is not a book of failures, but a book of victory and glory. Is it not glorious that on this earth God not only has a dwelling-place, but also a camp with an army?<p>In Numbers 2 we read, &#8220;And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, the children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers&#8217; houses: over against the tent of meeting shall they encamp round about&#8221; (vv. 1-2). Each tribe had a specific place in which to pitch their tents round about the tent of meeting. The tribes on the east were Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; those on the south were Reuben, Simeon, and Gad; on the west were Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin; and on the north were Dan, Asher, and Naphtali (Num. 2:3-31). In the very center were the Levites, who cared for the tabernacle (Num. 1:50-53; 2:17). The priests could never be separated from the tabernacle; they were one with the tabernacle and always with it. This picture of the twelve tribes encamped on the four sides of the tabernacle with the Levites in the center is a preview of the coming New Jerusalem. That city portrayed in Revelation has twelve gates, three on each of its four sides, containing the names of the twelve tribes (Rev. 21:12-13). That means that the New Jerusalem is not a new concept in Revelation. It was revealed many centuries before, in the book of Numbers. Thus, we see again that the whole of Scripture is of one line, related to one thing-God&#8217;s building. Even as the tabernacle in the Old Testament was the center of the twelve tribes of Israel, so God and the Lamb are the temple in the center of the New Jerusalem.<p>From beginning to end the book of Numbers is a glorious book. In the beginning God formed the army, and at the end we have a record of the dividing of the land conquered by this army. In the beginning the camps were arrayed in preparation for battle. In the forming of the house of Israel into a fighting army, we again see the principle revealed in Genesis 1: God desires a corporate man to represent Him in subduing and regaining this earth from the usurping hand of Satan. God had given Israel a good land called Canaan, but the Israelites had to take this land from the usurping hand of God&#8217;s enemy. They could not gain the land easily; they must fight inch by inch, defeating all their enemies. The purpose and goal of the fighting was to possess the land.<p>The book of Numbers is a book of vital principles for us to apply today. Where is the army now? Are you in the army? This is the problem. There is no army, because there is no building. If the church is not built, there is no priesthood, and if there is no priesthood, there is no army. In Numbers 4:35, 39, and 43, the Hebrew word for the service of the priesthood really means warfare (See the footnote on Numbers 4:3 in the A.S.V.). This signifies that whenever the priests served together, they were fighting the battle. It was a warfare. We can testify of this from our experience: whenever we are in the real service of the Lord, there is always a battle taking place. This is why in the book of Joshua the priests took the lead when the children of Israel went into battle. The priests were the generals, the real soldiers. This is why we also must first have the building, and then we may have the priesthood, which becomes the army to fight God&#8217;s battle.<p>The book of Numbers presents a glorious scene with the standards and ensigns, the formations and the order. All these things are full of application for us today. The army consisted of twelve tribes in four divisions, with three tribes in each division. Again we see the numbers, three and four-the Triune God mingled with man. The principle of mingling is represented by three times four, equaling twelve. God is not only added to us, but also mingled with us. The book of Revelation begins with a record of the seven churches, which are divided into one section of four plus another section of three. This signifies that the Triune God is added to the creature, as three is added to four, equaling seven. But Revelation ends with the New Jerusalem, where all the numbers are twelve; that is, three times four, signifying God&#8217;s mingling with us. The real building of God is this mingling of God with man.<p>In the army there was only one weapon-the ark. The Israelites fought their battles with the ark. In the center of the army of Israel was the tabernacle. All their activities, all their moves, depended upon the tabernacle. When the tabernacle remained in a certain place, the house of Israel, the army, also remained. When the tabernacle moved, everyone moved with it (Num. 9:17-23). These Old Testament illustrations reveal clearly the principle that all the fighting of God&#8217;s army accompanies the building of the church. When the church moves, the fighting proceeds; when the church stops, the fighting ceases. The fighting is one with the move of the church.<h2 class=head2>(5) The Tabernacle and the Possessing of the Good Land</h2><p>Following the book of Numbers, the book of Deuteronomy describes the good land of Canaan and reveals how the children of Israel conducted themselves in that land. In typology, this land is exceedingly meaningful to us today. It is a picture of the all-inclusive Christ. We must go on to experience this Christ, but the more we experience Him in our daily life, the more spiritual warfare we will encounter. The children of Israel enjoyed the land in Egypt apart from any battle. Even so, if we experience Christ only as the passover lamb (1 Cor. 5:7), we will not experience any warfare. If we would go on to enjoy Christ in a further degree, such as the heavenly manna day by day (1 Cor. 10:3), then we must defeat the Egyptians (Exo. 14) as well as the Amalekites (Exo. 17). Deuteronomy gives the details of the enjoyment of Christ as the all-inclusive One. First, He is enjoyed as the passover lamb in Egypt. Then He is enjoyed as the heavenly manna and the living water in the wilderness. His enjoyment is also typified by all the offerings, as well as the ark with the enlarged tabernacle. All the furniture of the tabernacle-the table of showbread, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark-are types of how we must enjoy Christ by a daily experience of Him. Eventually, we must enter the good land of Canaan, typifying an enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. Here we are confronted with many battles. The enemy of God does not want us to enter into such an experience. He is determined to frustrate us and keep us from enjoying the good land, the all-inclusive Christ. Therefore, we must fight the battle and defeat the enemy.<p>Not one battle was fought by any individual Israelite. All the battles were fought by the army. We can never fight the battle alone. Chapter six of Ephesians speaks of the spiritual warfare. Such warfare is a matter of the whole Body of Christ, not any one individual believer. We must fight the battle in the Body. This is why we need the house, the building, for the house is the serving priesthood, and the priesthood is the fighting army. This is why we must be built up and formed as a priesthood to serve God; it is only then that we may be the army which can fight the battle in a coordinated way.<p>The main point concerning the possessing of the good land is the actual fighting, as seen in the book of Joshua. The book of Numbers informs us concerning the formation of the army, while Joshua records the army marching and fighting to possess the land. We have already mentioned the weapon used by the army-the ark. Now we must see the way of engaging in the warfare. The way is simply this-the priests bear the ark on their shoulders into battle. This ark is called the ark of testimony. The only way for us to fight as a spiritual army is to bear Christ as our testimony. Christ as the testimony is sufficient. We should never argue, debate, or quarrel with others, but simply bear Christ as the testimony. He is the most powerful, the most prevailing weapon.<p>The first stronghold encountered by the Israelites was the city of Jericho. Let us see how that city was defeated. The Lord commanded Joshua, &#8220;Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark&#8221; (Josh. 6:4). The priests were the real generals, the real soldiers. Their weapons were not guns, but the ark, and with the ark they also blew the rams&#8217; horns. The ram is something related to God&#8217;s redemption and God&#8217;s peace. We have seen how the rams&#8217; skins were used as a part of the covering over the tabernacle (Exo. 26:14). The priests blew the trumpets of Christ&#8217;s redemption and peace in the time of war.<p>We need not argue with others; we should just bear Christ and sometimes blow the trumpet. Blowing the trumpet means giving the testimony. If someone argues, just praise the Lord. The more they try to condemn you, the more you should give the testimony and praise the Lord. If you bear the ark and blow the horn in such a way, you will win the battle. Jericho will surely fall. The more they quarrel and fight, the more they will collapse. Your part is to do nothing but bear the ark and blow the horn.<h2 class=head2>(6) The Tabernacle and the Established Worship Center</h2><p>The sixth major point concerns the setting up of the tabernacle after the battle has been won. Joshua 18:1 says, &#8220;And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.&#8221; Praise the Lord that the land was subdued! Here we must be reminded again of Genesis 1 and the principle of the earth being subdued by man as God&#8217;s representative. The tabernacle was erected and established because the land was subdued. There was no more wandering because the victory was won. The tabernacle was set up at a place called Shiloh; the tabernacle was an established center where the people could seek and find God. The book of 1 Samuel tells how the father of Samuel left his own city once each year to worship and sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh (1 Sam. 1:3). He made this yearly trip because the tabernacle was there.<p>In 1 Samuel 1:9, the tabernacle is spoken of as the temple. This was not the future temple built of stones, but the existing tabernacle, which was called the temple. In 1 Samuel 1:24, the tabernacle in Shiloh is called the house of the Lord. These two references are full of meaning. When Samuel was weaned as a child, his mother brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh. Samuel&#8217;s mother and father had a definite place where they could go to meet God. If in the whole land of Canaan there was not such a definite place with the tabernacle established, the people would have no place to meet God. Even so, when the proper church is built up and the battle is won, a center is established where people can easily meet God. There must be such a place as a center where seeking ones can meet God. However, all of this depends on the building.<p>With the bird&#8217;s-eye view of this vast area of Scripture, from the end of Exodus to the beginning of 1 Samuel, we realize that it is a record of just one thing-God&#8217;s building. Exodus reveals the finished tabernacle. Immediately following, Leviticus tells us that it is from the tabernacle that God speaks, and then it goes on to describe the priesthood serving God. Numbers then reveals the formation of the army for the purpose of conquering the enemy and possessing the land. Deuteronomy tells the people how to enjoy the land, and Joshua gives the record of the fighting, of the final victory, of the ground being gained, and of the tabernacle being erected in an established center. The tabernacle is set up in a definite place as a center for God&#8217;s seeking ones to come and worship Him. Praise God for this definite place where His glory was manifested! The enemy was defeated, the land was subdued, and God&#8217;s dwelling-place was set up. It was so easy for God&#8217;s people to meet and worship Him. All this depended upon the building.<p>The Old Testament is but a type, a shadow, of the New Testament. These books have presented a picture of the real church life. Today we also must be built together and formed as a priesthood to serve the Lord. Then we will be an army to fight and win the battles, and thus we will recover the land that God&#8217;s house may be established. On the ground which is won we will have a definite center where the seeking ones may meet and worship God. This brief sketch from these Old Testament books is the key which opens to us the secret of God&#8217;s Word. This is the key to the real building, the real church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HISTORY OF THE TABERNACLE AND THE ARK</h1><p>The history of the tabernacle with the ark is vitally important if we would realize God&#8217;s desire concerning His building. In the previous chapter we saw that when the tabernacle was completed, six major things followed. Firstly, the glory of God Himself appeared on this earth and filled the tabernacle. The glory of God&#8217;s presence was clearly seen by His people-this is no small matter. Secondly, God spoke from the tabernacle. To receive God&#8217;s word we must come to the building of God. Thirdly, a priestly service or a priesthood was formed. Fourthly, this priesthood was also an army to fight the battle for God. Fifthly, all the battles were won with the purpose of gaining the ground for God&#8217;s building. And lastly, the tabernacle was set up as a worship center in a place called Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). From that time, any person seeking the Lord, such as Samuel&#8217;s parents (1 Sam. 1:3-9), had a definite place to go. How wonderful the situation was! But it did not last long.<h2 class=head1>THE ARK CAPTURED</h2><p>During the time of Eli the priest, the people of Israel failed God. They were sinful in the eyes of God; they were wrong with God; yet they still went on to fight the battle. Of course, they were defeated (1 Sam. 4:1-2). We must realize that whenever the children of God are defeated by the enemy, it is proof that they are wrong with God. If we are rightly related to God, we can never be defeated. When we are wrong with Him, we must be defeated, for the ground is lost. We must learn this vital lesson.<p>Though the Israelites were defeated, they would not learn their lesson, they would not be judged and dealt with by the Lord. Rather, they developed a certain superstitious attitude concerning the power of the ark of God. Because they were wrong with God they misused the ark. They superstitiously planned to let the ark fight the battle for them (1 Sam. 4:3-9).<h2 class=head1>THE ARK SEPARATED FROM THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>The ark did not help the Israelites. They were defeated, the ark was captured, and the two sons of Eli the priest, the two leaders, were killed (1 Sam. 4:10-11). The glory of God departed from the Israelites (1 Sam. 4:19-22), and the tabernacle was left empty. They retained the outward expression, but it was an empty vessel; the content was gone. The ark failed to protect them, for they had not learned their lesson.<p>In a sense, the Israelites were not completely superstitious in depending upon the ark to win their battle. The ark was indeed powerful, for it did protect itself. After defeating the people of Israel in battle, the Philistines placed the captured ark in their own temple, and in so doing their idol was slain. Eventually, the ark itself defeated and subdued the Philistines (1 Sam. 5). The Philistines had vanquished thousands of the Israelites in battle, but they could not vanquish the little ark. They simply did not know how to handle it nor what to do with it. Eventually they decided to send the troublesome ark back to the Israelites and did so (1 Sam. 6:1-16), sending it to Beth-shemesh. Upon receiving the ark, the people of Beth-shemesh dealt carelessly with it, and many of them were smitten by the Lord. The Beth-shemeshites then sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, asking them to take the ark to their place. Hence, the men of Kirjath-jearim fetched the ark and brought it into the house of a priest named Abinadab, where it remained for twenty years (1 Sam. 6:12-7:2).<p>The situation was indeed abnormal: the tabernacle with the altar was in Shiloh, but the ark was in Kirjath-jearim. The content was separated from the vessel, and the vessel was left empty. This situation prevailed until a full recovery was realized by the people of Israel. The ark must be in the tabernacle. If we would have a normal church life, we must have Christ, the ark, in the church, the tabernacle. All these events in the history of Samuel, Saul, and David occurred with only one object and purpose in view-God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>A MAN AFTER GOD&#8217;S HEART</h2><p>The abnormal state of ark and tabernacle in separation lasted for at least twenty years. God suffered long because His ark was not in the tabernacle. The desire of God&#8217;s heart was for His building. Finally, God found David, a man after the desire of His own heart (1 Sam. 13:14). Saul was not such a man. Saul walked according to his flesh, his lusts, his own aims. Thus, God raised up David as king over Israel.<p>Upon taking the throne as king, practically the first thing in David&#8217;s heart was to care for the ark. It was in relation to this that Psalm 132 was written. &#8220;He [David] sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed, I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids; until I find out a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob. Lo, we heard of it in Ephratah: we found it in the field of the wood. [&#8220;Of the wood&#8221; is in Hebrew &#8220;of Jaar.&#8221; Jaar is the short form in poetry for Kirjath-jearim.] We will go into his tabernacles; we will worship at his footstool. Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place; thou, and the ark of thy strength...the Lord hath sworn unto David in truth...the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my resting- place forever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it&#8221; (Psa. 132:2-8, 11, 13-14). Psalm 132 reveals the ark and the Lord, which are identified as one. The ark cannot be separated from the Lord Himself. The Lord&#8217;s presence is always with the ark, for the ark is the very embodiment of the Lord and the testimony of the Lord.<p>Although David was such a man after God&#8217;s heart, yet before he ascended to the throne he had no authority to act. Once on the throne, however, he had the ground to accomplish God&#8217;s will and attempted to bring the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Zion (1 Chron. 13:5). Zion was the choicest location in Jerusalem, and Jerusalem was the best place in the entire land of Canaan. This means that David prepared the first and highest place, the choicest spot, for God&#8217;s ark. David&#8217;s heart was really for God&#8217;s dwelling-place. He was a man after God&#8217;s heart, the kind of man God is seeking for His building. May we be such men today. May we seek God&#8217;s desire that His dwelling-place may be realized among His people even on this earth today!<h2 class=head1>A NECESSARY LESSON</h2><p>David followed God with a sincere heart, but when he sent for the ark he lacked enlightenment. He had a heart for God, but not the light from God; so he acted wrongly. The Philistines had previously used a cart to return the ark to Israel. David thought that that was quite suitable; so he used a new cart to bring the ark to Zion. God tolerated the ignorant Gentiles, but David had to learn the lesson. He had to learn not to do things according to the way of worldly people, but according to the way of God&#8217;s holiness. While transporting the ark, David met with an accident. The oxen pulling the cart stumbled, and the ark began to fall; whereupon Uzzah, one of the men, put forth his hand to steady the ark. The fleshly hand tried its best to help, but God never needs such help! If God wants something to fall, we must never attempt to hold it. We had better let it fall; then we will be blessed. Uzzah tried to keep the ark from falling; but not only did the ark fall, but Uzzah himself fell dead. By this death the move of the ark was frustrated, and David was greatly disturbed. He became fearful of the ark and abandoned his attempt to transport it by a cart.<p>David was indeed wrong in moving the ark according to the worldly way, and he was also mistaken in his human opinion. We must not touch Christ according to the worldly way; we must never touch the testimony of God according to the Philistines&#8217; way; to do so is spiritual death. We must learn to abandon the worldly system and keep our hands off. David should have been enlightened by reading the record of God&#8217;s Word. He should have seen the revelation of God and learned the divine way, rather than use the way of the world. We must always touch Christ, the testimony of God, by the divine way revealed in the Word. We should never move on the basis of good in relation to the ark, attempting to do something good for God, even with a good motive or a sincere heart. We must be extremely careful, lest we bring in spiritual death. May we be faithful to God and learn to fear God, not going along with the worldly way, not exercising our human efforts, but rather learning God&#8217;s Word, God&#8217;s commandment, to do the right thing in the right way. It is not sufficient simply to know the right thing; we must also have the right way. Praise the Lord for the good intentions and motives, but is your way by &#8220;the cart,&#8221; or by the priests carrying the ark? Are you proceeding according to the worldly system, or according to God&#8217;s revelation?<p>The practice of Christmas affords an example of how Christians attempt to do good for God in a worldly way. Many argue in favor of this holiday. They claim that sending Christmas cards will help others to know Christ. They &#8220;preach the gospel&#8221; by Christmas cards. But that is doing things in the Philistine way. The card is just like the cart. We need a living testimony to preach the gospel of Christ. We need the living priests to bring Christ to people. Then the issue will be life and not death. We may use many things to illustrate the same principle.<p>Christianity today loves to take advantage of so many worldly, Philistine systems. They argue, &#8220;What is wrong with carrying the ark by a cart?&#8221; It may be all right for the world, but it is not all right for us! If we would be men after God&#8217;s heart, then we must also be men after God&#8217;s mind, after God&#8217;s way, not using our minds or our way. We should not have the mind or the way of the people of this world. The cart issues in death.<h2 class=head1>HALFWAY SATISFACTION</h2><p>Upon the incident of Uzzah and the resulting frustration, David left the ark with a man named Obed-edom (2 Sam. 6:1-10). He thought that he had nicely settled his dilemma and would now be at peace. But after a short time, he was informed that God had greatly blessed Obed-edom. David was moved, so much so that he proceeded to bring the ark from the house of Obed-edom into his own city (2 Sam. 6:11-12). It is always like this with spiritual blessings: people discover where the blessing of the Lord is, and they want a share in it. David had now learned his lesson with God. This time he realized that the ark should not be borne by a cart, but by living persons. And it was not to be carried by just anyone, but by those who were designated, separated and holy. Only the priests could bear the ark (1 Chron. 15:1-15), several priests together in a coordinated way. One priest alone could not bear the ark on his shoulder; he must carry it in coordination with others. If one priest was short in stature, he must stretch up a bit; if another was tall, he must stoop a little. If another was fast, he must slow down; if another moved too slowly, he must quicken his pace. If they could not coordinate together, they could not bear the responsibility of carrying the ark. David realized this lesson of responsibility. Living persons, the priests, must carry the ark in coordination to its destination. David finally succeeded in bringing the ark to Mount Zion, the choicest spot in Jerusalem (1 Chron. 15:25; 16:1).<p>On Mount Zion David had prepared a tent to contain the ark. Was this all right? No, it was not absolutely right. With this arrangement there was not yet complete satisfaction. One day David realized the need of a proper and established temple to be built up to house the ark of the Lord.<p>Many times we desire to do something for God. In our first endeavor we are totally wrong. Then we learn our lesson and begin again. Yet in our second attempt we are only half right; fifty percent of what we are doing is still wrong. But God is a tolerating God. He tolerated David&#8217;s shortcoming in bringing the ark into a tent of his own choosing in Zion. David should have put the ark in the tabernacle originally made according to the pattern revealed by God. Therefore, he still did not have settled peace. Many times after accomplishing something for God, we do not have full peace and rest; we do not have full satisfaction. The reason is that we did not act in an absolutely right way.<h2 class=head1>THE NEEDFUL PREPARATIONS</h2><p>David then conceived to build a temple for God. This was indeed good, but God&#8217;s answer to him was no. God&#8217;s reason in so replying was firstly that David had been a man of war (1 Chron. 28:3). Only a man of peace could build the house of God. Secondly, God promised David that He would give full peace to the people of Israel. It is only in peace that the house of God can be built up. Thirdly, God told David that He would first build a house for David, and from that house God would raise up a son to build a house for Himself (2 Sam. 7:1-13; 1 Chron. 28:5-6). God would not give man any ground to boast of doing something first for God. The testimony must be that man can only do something for God out of that which God has first done for him. Thus, David did not build a house for God; rather, he prepared the materials (1 Chron. 28:2; 29:1-9) and the ground (1 Chron. 21:18-30; 2 Chron. 3:1). Finally he prepared Solomon, the builder, and all the helpers (1 Chron. 28:9-11, 20-21). Eventually, after all these preparations, Solomon received the authority on the throne and built the temple (1 Kings 6:1-2).<h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2><p>The temple built by Solomon was not according to any human design, for God had clearly shown David the pattern of the building (1 Chron. 28:11-19). In the same way, on the mount of Sinai, God showed Moses the pattern of the tabernacle. Both the tabernacle and the temple were built according to the design given by God. Thus Solomon built the temple on the proper ground according to the pattern revealed to his father David.<p>The temple was much larger in size than the tabernacle. The tabernacle was thirty cubits long by ten cubits wide, but the temple was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, just double the size of the tabernacle. The tabernacle was ten cubits high, but the temple was thirty cubits high (1 Kings 6:2). Everything in the temple was much enlarged and increased. Furthermore, the tabernacle was made of wood overlaid with gold, while the temple was built with stones and wood overlaid with gold. The tabernacle was portable and lacked a floor, but the temple had a strong foundation and a floor of wood overlaid with gold. Not only was acacia wood used in the temple, such as was used in the tabernacle, but there was also cypress (fir), cedar, and olive wood. These three different kinds of wood signify the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Everything in the temple was more solid, more stable, and more established (1 Kings 6:7-22, 29-36). Finally, the ark and the entire tabernacle as well, including the brass altar and all the other vessels, were brought to the temple (1 Kings 8:1-4). Everything of the old tabernacle was brought to the temple to be mingled with it as one.<p>Then the glory of God filled the temple just as it did the tabernacle (1 Kings 8:10-11). Again the glory of God&#8217;s presence was seen on this earth, but this time it was in an increased portion. God&#8217;s doing is victorious! God moves on in steady progress! Regardless of how much the enemy would and could do to damage and frustrate God&#8217;s building on this earth, God brings forth something better, something larger than what has been damaged and frustrated. The enemy damaged the tabernacle and frustrated the recovery of its normal condition, but eventually God built a larger dwelling, the temple, in a more normal condition. God can never be defeated in His purpose!<h2 class=head1>A PREFIGURE OF CHURCH HISTORY</h2><p>The history of the tabernacle with the ark is a prefigure of church history, giving us a full portrait of the course and situation of the church from the very beginning to the present time. There are five main aspects:<h2 class=head2>(1) The Church with Christ in It</h2><p>In the beginning the tabernacle contained the ark. As God&#8217;s dwelling-place, the two were one. That was normal. The tabernacle was the very expression, and the ark was the content. This prefigures the first stage of the church: Christ was contained in the church; the church was the expression of Christ, and Christ was the very content of the church. On the day of Pentecost Christ was in the church. At that day Christ was the ark and the church was the tabernacle. That was the absolutely normal condition.<h2 class=head2>(2) The Church without Christ in It</h2><p>History reveals that this wonderful situation, this pleasant prospect of the ark contained in the tabernacle, did not last long. The ark was captured because of the failure of the people of God. The ark was separated from the tabernacle, and the tabernacle became empty. This portrays the failures of the Christians causing the church to lose the reality and presence of Christ. This is the second aspect, the second situation. Christ as the very content was separated from the church, and the church became an empty vessel, just an outward expression with no inward reality. In principle, this sort of abnormal situation has been existing for many centuries. Even today, many so-called Christian churches are empty tabernacles without Christ in them as the reality. The biggest problem today is the so-called church without Christ&#8217;s presence within it. How much of Christ do you sense when you attend some &#8220;church&#8221; services? When I was young, I attended two different kinds of so-called churches, and I must confess that not once did I have the sense of meeting Christ in their services. Because of the sins of Christians and the failures of churches, Christ has departed from many so-called churches. All that remains is an empty tabernacle.<h2 class=head2>(3) Christ without the Church</h2><p>The third situation prefigured in the Old Testament is that of the ark without the tabernacle. Firstly in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim for twenty years (1 Sam. 7:1-2) and then in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months (2 Sam. 6:10-12) the ark was apart from the tabernacle. The blessing of God came upon Obed-edom&#8217;s house because of the ark&#8217;s presence, yet the tabernacle was still in Shiloh, separated from the ark. This third condition when compared with the second is much better. However, it is still not normal. Church history reveals that from the second century to the present time there have been many Obed-edoms. There have been many persons with the reality and presence of Christ in their personal lives. The ark was with them, but this was not the normal state. Throughout church history there have consistently been these two conditions. There has always been the situation of Shiloh, that of the tabernacle without the ark. That is the condition of the so-called formal churches-they are the tabernacle without the reality, without Christ. And there have also been so many dear Obed-edoms, people with Christ in their lives and Christ in their homes.<p>If you were confronted with these two conditions, which would you choose? Would you go to Shiloh, to the empty tabernacle? Or would you take the ark? When Solomon was a young king, he thought that if he would worship by offering his offerings to the Lord he must do it at the tabernacle. So he went to Gibeon (which possibly was another name for Shiloh) with his people to offer sacrifices to God. He was using his natural understanding apart from revelation or vision. At Gibeon (Shiloh) the Lord appeared to Solomon in the night and asked him what he desired. Solomon requested wisdom from the Lord, and the Lord truly answered him. The next morning when Solomon awakened, he had the wisdom: he became clear that he was not in the right place. He had to return to the ark. He had received wisdom in a vision (2 Chron. 1:3-13; 1 Kings 3:15).<p>Both conditions, the tabernacle without the ark and the ark apart from the tabernacle are abnormal. But comparatively speaking, the first is worse than the second. When you are confronted by these two conditions, you must go to the ark rather than to the empty tabernacle. However, the ark alone will not give full satisfaction, for it is only one-half of the total picture. The best, normal, and satisfying situation is that of the ark within the tabernacle. Many Christians readily agree to go to Obed-edom&#8217;s house, to the place where Christ is. They think that as long as they have Christ, everything is all right. But this is not completely right. You have the content, but you do not have the vessel; you have the reality without the expression. You still need a proper church, a proper tabernacle. The ark is important, but you still need a tabernacle. Christ is the reality, but you still need the church as the expression of Christ. If Christ is separated from the church, it is better to choose Christ; but this is still an abnormal situation. We must have the church with Christ within it.<h2 class=head2>(4) Christ with an Inadequate Church</h2><p>The fourth position is that of the ark in an improper, inadequate tabernacle. King David had prepared a tabernacle in Zion, but it was not according to the pattern revealed by God on the mount. It was a tent pitched according to David&#8217;s opinion. Church history is full of such incidents. So many faithful Christians do have the ark-Christ alone. Then, later, they sense the need of the church life to express Christ just as David sensed the need of a tabernacle to contain the ark. So they pitch a tabernacle, they set up a meeting according to their own understanding, according to the same principle practiced by David. Some Christians pitch a tabernacle on their &#8220;Zion,&#8221; while others pitch another tabernacle on the ground of their choosing. Is not this the situation today? There are many, many &#8220;Zions.&#8221; All say that their place is Zion, the highest and the best. Some Christians have even relinquished their family life and their jobs in order to pitch a little tent for the ark. So many have meetings in their homes. &#8220;What is wrong with this?&#8221; you may ask. &#8220;Is this not good?&#8221; Yes, David also did something good with a good heart and good intentions. But it was not according to the Lord&#8217;s revelation; so it did not bring full satisfaction. It was good, but it was inadequate; it fell short of God&#8217;s full purpose.<p>We must be exceedingly clear concerning the principles of these four conditions of history. The first is the normal condition of the church with Christ within it. The second is that of the church without Christ-a completely abnormal situation. The third condition is that of Christ without the church. That is better, but it is still abnormal. There are many people today in this third condition. They are disgusted with the empty church life; so they abandon the thought of having any kind of church life. After a certain time, however, they sense the need of meeting together and begin a certain kind of church according to their own wisdom and choice. This is not proper. This is the fourth condition-Christ in an improper &#8220;church.&#8221; This situation is only half right. Such Christians know deeply within themselves that they do not have full satisfaction. Yes, they are doing good, helping people, and trying to meet together to glorify the Lord, but they do not have full satisfaction in their way of practice. They still have a deep sense that they need something more proper. They have a certain kind of church life, but not the proper church life, the proper tabernacle. Although they do not know the proper way, they sense that what they have is not so proper. They lack the full assurance that what they are practicing is completely right. There is no need of argument or debate concerning this matter: if we feel peaceful concerning the way of our church practice, let us continue; but most people in this poor condition do not have full peace or satisfaction, because in fact they have fallen short of the full purpose of God concerning the church life.<h2 class=head2>(5) Christ with a Proper Church</h2><p>The fifth condition is that of the ark with the proper tabernacle, enlarged and increased. It is in this situation, of Christ with a proper church to express Himself, that you feel completely at home. Praise the Lord, I have been at home for more than thirty years now! People may try to criticize or argue, but I know that most of them have some degree of emptiness within them. I can say with full assurance that I am at home; I know that I am in the church containing Christ, and I know that I have Christ with a proper church life. We will see more concerning the proper church life in the following chapters.<p>We must all be clear concerning these five positions in history. The first is completely right, while the second is completely empty; the third position is good, but abnormal, and the fourth position is one of half-satisfaction; the fifth position is that of Christ as the reality with a proper church as the expression. We will never be fully satisfied until we come to the fifth position. I believe that in these last days the Lord is not only going to recover the original, normal condition, but He is also going to enlarge the church life and make it more solid. There are many attacks from the enemy, but the Lord is faithful; the faithfulness of the Lord will see to it-He cannot deny Himself. He is victorious. He can never be defeated! Eventually He will accomplish whatever is necessary to fulfill His purpose in a more solid and full way. Let us praise Him!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECOVERY AND ENLARGEMENT OF GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h1><p>The six Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles reveal not only a history of the tabernacle with its ark, but also the recovery and enlargement of God&#8217;s building. If we have only seen the record of history, that is not sufficient. From the history we must see God&#8217;s way of recovery and enlargement. The record is mostly on the negative side, while the recovery and the enlargement are positive. All history is for the purpose of the enlargement of God&#8217;s building.<p>By the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit the six books of history to which we have referred are put together as a set. At the very beginning there is a good prospect-God&#8217;s building has been established in a definite place called Shiloh. The people need wander no longer; from that time anyone desiring God had a definite place to which he could go. How wonderful it is to have a definite place where we can meet God.<h2 class=head1>THE DEGRADATION</h2><p>This pleasant situation, this glorious prospect, did not last long. The ark was captured, and God&#8217;s building suffered severe degradation (1 Sam. 3-6). But even before the ark was captured, the situation within the tabernacle was full of gloom. There was no light; everything was in darkness. There was no fresh word, no fresh revelation from God. The priests had become old and out of date. Therefore, God raised up a child: He was forced to bring forth something fresh and new. We must learn never to be old.<p>The degradation worsened. The Israelites would not get right with God; instead, they became superstitious. They used the ark to fight one of their battles; the ark was captured, and degradation reached its worst.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S RECOVERY AND ENLARGEMENT</h2><p>But although the ark was captured, God&#8217;s recovery began at that very point. We must realize that God can never be defeated in His purpose. God&#8217;s enemy may frustrate and delay Him for a time, but Satan can never frustrate God to the uttermost. God&#8217;s purpose must be fulfilled. Once God plans something, He will inevitably accomplish it. According to chapters 5 and 6 of 1 Samuel, it appears that the purpose of God has been overthrown: the ark was captured by the enemy. However, all the enemy&#8217;s activity and frustration only opens the way, not only for God&#8217;s recovery, but also for God&#8217;s enlargement! When God recovers something, He always enlarges it. We need glorious insight to understand all these things.<p>Based upon the history of the degradation of God&#8217;s people, some Christian teachers have taught that once the situation is degraded it can never be recovered. However, by reading the Scriptures over and over, we see just the contrary. Once the situation among God&#8217;s people is degraded, God eventually and inevitably recovers and enlarges it. During our early years in the Lord&#8217;s service, we were somewhat influenced by the negative teaching of these Christian teachers. To some extent, we took the same view. But later, by the Lord&#8217;s enlightenment, we discovered just the opposite in the Scriptures. How can we say that the things which have been degraded can never be recovered? Eventually there will be the New Jerusalem, which is far better than anything! That will be much better, transcendently better than the situation at the day of Pentecost.<p>In 1 Samuel, the beginning of this set of six books, there is a tabernacle, but in the last three books of this set there is a temple. The temple is a tremendous improvement over the tabernacle. In fact, there is no comparison. In the tabernacle there were altogether twenty-four pieces of precious stones, but they were all rather small. The forty-eight boards, though they were overlaid with gold, were all thin and narrow. Both the stones and the boards were indeed precious, but they had little size or weight. Furthermore, the tabernacle had some sort of foundation, but there was no floor, for the tabernacle was erected in the wilderness. Now let us consider the temple. The precious stones used there were huge, incomparably larger that those in the tabernacle. In the temple there was not a small amount of one kind of wood as in the tabernacle, but an abundance of three kinds of wood-olive, fir (or cypress) and cedar of Lebanon. Even the ground floor in the temple was made of wood overlaid with gold. The length of the tabernacle was thirty cubits, but the length of the temple was sixty. The width of the tabernacle was ten cubits, but the width of the temple was twenty. All the horizontal dimensions were doubled. The tabernacle was ten cubits high, while the temple was thirty cubits high-three times higher. Thus, the tabernacle was not only recovered in the temple, but also much enlarged.<p>Some Bible teachers, as we have mentioned, do not see how things which are once degraded can ever be recovered. They insist that all these things are dispensationally past and can never be regained. But according to typology the picture is exceedingly clear that something which has been degraded can not only be recovered, but also enlarged. Oh, praise the Lord! We must have the faith to believe this. The church can be much better today than at the time of Pentecost. God is moving on! If God was One who could always be defeated, how could He reach His goal? Regardless of how much degradation and confusion there is, God is marching on. If you have this glorious vision, you will never be discouraged or disappointed. Some Bible teachers are always bemoaning the fact of how far the church today is removed from its wonderful state at the day of Pentecost. If you are in this condition, you do not have adequate vision. If your eyes have been opened to see the Lord&#8217;s recovery, you will leap up and shout, &#8220;Hallelujah, regardless of the degradation and confusion, the Lord is marching on!&#8221; It is really glorious.<p>From 1939 to 1942 Brother Watchman Nee was helping us during a time of informal training in Shanghai. One night, in a prayer meeting of the church, someone prayed like this: &#8220;O Lord, we are so pitiful! The church is so weak and poor; there is nothing but disappointment!&#8221; It sounded good and many responded with Amens. But Brother Nee immediately interjected a prayer something like this: &#8220;Lord, Thy church can never be defeated. In Thy eyes the church is strong, the church is beautiful.&#8221; So many followed this prayer with, &#8220;Hallelujah, Amen!&#8221; It was a great contrast.<p>Everything depends upon our vision. The Lord told Balaam, the Gentile prophet, &#8220;He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel&#8221; (Num. 23:21). In the eyes of the Lord, &#8220;How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy tabernacles, O Israel!&#8221; (Num. 24:5). God always sees through the valleys to the goal. Of course, if you are in a valley, you may bemoan the fact. But that is not the end-that is just an underpass on the highway to the goal. You must drive through the underpass to the goal upon the high mountain. We must learn to see through things to the goal, not only with insight, but also with foresight. The church can never be defeated! You are wrong if you say the church is always defeated. The church will eventually be victorious! We must see God&#8217;s way in the recovery and enlargement of His building.<h2 class=head1>HOW GOD USED DAVID IN HIS ENLARGEMENT</h2><p>In 1 Samuel 13:14, God told Saul: &#8220;Now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart.&#8221; The beginning of God&#8217;s recovery of His building was with David, a man after His own heart. If you are interested in the recovery and enlargement of God&#8217;s building, you by God&#8217;s mercy must be a man after His own heart.<p>The book of 1 Samuel portrays David as the man after God&#8217;s heart, but also as one who is inexperienced and young. David had to be worked upon and wrought through to become ripened and experienced. The only way he could be prepared was by suffering. Thus, God put David under the headship of Saul. David suffered much, undergoing many kinds of trials, afflictions, and ill treatment. He became a real student in suffering; he learned the lesson of suffering; he became completely successful in suffering. All the sufferings experienced by us deal with our nature, our self, our flesh. David was so tested; his flesh, his self, and his natural life were severely dealt with. To use the language of the New Testament, David learned the lessons of the cross. Abraham&#8217;s life was a life of faith, but David&#8217;s was a life of suffering under the lessons of the cross. If we mean business today for the proper church life, if we are really interested in the recovery and enlargement of God&#8217;s building, we must be continually willing and ready to be ill-treated and broken that we may learn the lessons of the cross. The many chapters of 1 Samuel stress this one point: that a man after God&#8217;s heart will be subjected to severe pressure that he may learn the lessons of the cross. The flesh, the self, and the natural life must be broken; the motives must be tested. David was subjected to the ill-treatment of Saul in order to be broken. Many young brothers today need such a Saul, a Saul who will continually deal with them, ill-treat them, and suppress them. We must be put into trials and broken.<p>Because David had successfully learned this lesson of suffering, he could enter into the kingdom. God took the kingdom from the hand of Saul and delivered it to David. David had passed the examination. But this was not yet the end: although he had successfully passed this test and gained the throne, he was still not adequate for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. He still had something hidden within him which must be exposed. Following his enthronement, he still found it in his power to do something for the Lord for which he could boast and take the credit. The Lord will never allow man to boast in such a way. David conceived to build a house for God; he desired to recover the tabernacle and enlarge it. Even Nathan the prophet, upon hearing of David&#8217;s desire, encouraged him in this project; he went along with David in a natural way. But the Lord immediately intervened. During the night He commanded Nathan to tell His servant David not to build Him a house, for David&#8217;s work at that time would afford him something of which to boast. God could not permit that. We have seen how David was told to wait until God built a house for him; then, from that house a son would come forth to build a house for God (2 Sam. 7:1-13). The meaning here is that man cannot glory in anyone but God. It is not what we can do for God, but what God can do for us.<p>Following this word of God to David, the Scriptures record two great failures. Firstly, David killed one of his own men, Uriah; and not only this, he took Uriah&#8217;s wife (2 Sam. 11). Could you imagine that a person like David would do such a shameful and sinful thing? If this incident were not recorded in Scripture, you would never believe it. David&#8217;s sinful deed was permitted by the Lord. The Lord undoubtedly could have interceded and frustrated David from doing this thing, but God withdrew His hand just a little from David so that his real condition could be brought to the surface and exposed. If we read only 1 Samuel, we may conceive that David was perfect and wonderful, but 2 Samuel exposes him.<p>We must see the issue and consequence of this failure. It is a real mercy and very meaningful. Out of David&#8217;s failure came his son, Solomon, the very one who would build God&#8217;s building! Solomon, the son of David, was born of the wife of Uriah! Again, could you imagine that one who would build God&#8217;s temple would be born out of such a match? And it is recorded in the genealogy of Matthew 1: David begat a son by the wife of another person (Matt. 1:6). The greatness of the Lord&#8217;s mercy shines forth in this incident, for David had been forgiven of that sin. Psalm 51 reveals David&#8217;s repentance and God&#8217;s forgiveness. Thus, after forgiving David, God gave him a son, Solomon, who eventually built the house of God (2 Sam. 12:24-25). The mercy of God to man could alone be the testimony regarding such a house.<p>Now let us see David&#8217;s second failure, a failure which exposed him to the uttermost. David was first exposed in the case of Uriah that he might learn the lesson of humility. However, he was still so proud that he tried one day to count the total number of Israel (2 Sam. 24), thus manifesting not only his hidden pride, but also his unbelief in the Lord. The Lord intervened and judged David. But the issue, the consequence, of this second failure was indeed strange and marvelous. A piece of land gained because of this failure became the very site for the building of the temple (1 Chron. 21:18; 2 Chron. 3:1). The issue of his first failure was a son born to build the building, and the issue of the second failure was the obtaining of the land for the building. Such positive results from such negative failures are beyond our human understanding!<p>After reading 1 and 2 Samuel, we must bow before the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, I have nothing to say; it is all Thy mercy!&#8221; Even so today, the finished building will not be a testimony of how much we can do for God, but of how much God has done for us. Oh, we must learn to be a man after God&#8217;s heart, a man who has learned the lessons of the cross, who knows how sinful he is and how absolutely unsuitable he is to do anything for the Lord. We must learn the lesson of humility. Regardless of how much we are after God&#8217;s heart or how much we have learned the lessons of the cross, we still must be humble. No matter how careful we have been in the past or how careful we may be in the future, sooner or later the Lord will allow us to fail that He might expose us and humble us. Then we will realize that it is not we but the Lord, that it is not our attributes but the Lord&#8217;s mercy, the Lord&#8217;s grace. We must learn all these lessons. Never suppose that since you love the Lord and are continually learning the lessons of the cross that you must be the right person to build up His house. No! We are not the right person! What is within us must be exposed; our failures must be realized. We do not realize how sinful we are. When everything hidden within us is exposed, then we will be different. Then the Lord will use us, but the glory will not go to us, but to Him.<p>If David were here today and we began to praise him, he would stop us short and say, &#8220;Brother, don&#8217;t praise me. Read the story of Uriah&#8217;s wife; read about the numbering of the people. It is not my goodness, but the Lord&#8217;s mercy. Oh, it is His forgiveness, His mercy, His grace! It is all because of this that I received a son and a plot of land for the building up of the temple.&#8221;<p>David had learned the lessons of the cross; he had been exposed and humbled to the uttermost. He had no more trust, no more boast in himself, but deeply realized God&#8217;s mercy and grace. This was the man after God&#8217;s own heart, the man who fought the battles, gained the victories, prepared all the materials for God&#8217;s building, brought forth a son to build the house, and obtained the site for the building. In addition to all this, David also received the pattern for the temple. God had granted the builder, the site, the materials, and the blueprints. All that remained to be accomplished was the actual building.<p>It is through a life like David&#8217;s that all the needful things for the building up of the church are prepared. If the church is to be built up today, we must have a life after God&#8217;s heart, a life willing to learn the lessons of the cross, a life fully exposed and humbled, a life which knows the mercy and grace of God, and which has no trust, no boast, in its own human nature. It is through such a life that the building, the site, the material, and the pattern for God&#8217;s building are prepared. If we are serious concerning the church life, we must apply all these principles to ourselves. The main reason this group of six long, Old Testament books are given to us is that we might learn such lessons and see God&#8217;s way for the recovery and enlargement of His building.<p>During the past years, by the Lord&#8217;s mercy, I have experienced and observed these principles in action. On the other hand, I have seen so many dear seeking Christians who supposed that all they needed for the recovery of the church life was the acquisition of some Pentecostal gifts. While observing many cases, I have never seen one who succeeded in this way. The church life can never be recovered merely by Pentecostal gifts. It requires a life that has learned all the lessons of David. With such a person there is the possibility of the recovery of the church life. All these incidents are not simply a record of history, but types which indicate the way for the recovery of God&#8217;s building today.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S WAY OF RECOVERY THROUGH SOLOMON</h2><h2 class=head2>a) One Expression of the Ark</h2><p>David had prepared everything for God&#8217;s building. Now Solomon began to build the temple at Jerusalem at the place prepared by David and according to the pattern which God had given to David (2 Chron. 3:1). The historical account of this building is full of meaning, for it reveals how Solomon brought everything of the former tabernacle to the new temple. All the vessels including the ark were brought to it (1 Kings 8; 2 Chron. 6:41-7:3). There was still only one ark with one container. Everything was normal. We have already mentioned the abnormal situation which existed in David&#8217;s day-the proper tabernacle was at Shiloh, but the improper one pitched by David was on Mount Zion. Now, according to God&#8217;s way of recovery, the old, proper tabernacle was mingled with the new temple, and the one ark was brought into that temple. This is absolutely normal, a full recovery according to God&#8217;s pattern. We see here a vital and important principle. God will never allow two expressions of His ark to exist at the same time. The tabernacle could not exist by itself; it must be mingled with the temple. This proves that in God&#8217;s sight there was always one unique expression of His ark. God is never careless. According to our human opinion and way, as long as a better, enlarged temple is built up, we would forget the old one. We may think it is all right to leave the old one where it is, but God is more careful. If after the temple was built the old tabernacle still existed separately, ground would be left for some to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, though the temple is built, the tabernacle still remains. What&#8217;s wrong with having two or more expressions of the ark?&#8221; But God does not leave any such divisive ground to us. We cannot have two or more expressions of God&#8217;s testimony. There must be only one unique expression of the ark; the tabernacle must be swallowed up by the new temple. Thus, there was no division, no separation, and no confusion. We must realize today that there is only one unique expression of Christ in one unique church. This is God&#8217;s way of recovery.<h2 class=head2>b) The Meaning of Enlargement</h2><p>In God&#8217;s way of recovery through Solomon there was a tremendous enlargement. We have seen how the measurements of the temple were much greater than those of the tabernacle. Almost everything in the temple was two or three times enlarged (1 Kings 6:2, 20), and the utensils were enlarged ten times. However, there was one item which was not in the slightest enlarged-the ark. It is because the ark is Christ, and Christ Himself can never be enlarged. He is &#8220;the same yesterday and today, yea and forever&#8221; (Heb. 13:8). He is always the same. Our experience of Him, however, must be greatly increased and enlarged.<p>In God&#8217;s recovery through Solomon the brass altar of the outer court was much increased in size (2 Chron. 4:1). It accommodated many more offerings. This means that we must have an enlarged, increased experience of the cross of Christ. Our experience of consecration should be greatly increased. If the old, small brass altar were kept in the new building, it certainly would not fit. Even so, our experiences of the cross must be increased to match the enlargement of God&#8217;s building.<p>We do not have the measurements of the old laver in the tabernacle, but we do know that there was only one laver. However, in the temple, in the recovery, there were ten lavers. And between these ten lavers, in the center, was a sea-not a pool or a lake, but a sea (2 Chron. 4:2-6). This reveals that the exposing, enlightening, cleansing, and purging work of the Holy Spirit must be greatly enlarged and increased in us for God&#8217;s building.<p>In the former tabernacle the showbread table was very small, and there was only one. But in the temple there were ten showbread tables (2 Chron. 4:8), an increase of ten times. Formerly we experienced Christ in a small way as our bread of life, but now our experience of this living bread must be increased ten times. In the tabernacle there was only one small lampstand, but in the temple there were ten lampstands (2 Chron. 4:7). Our experience of Christ as the light of life shining within us must also be increased to match the showbread tables in the enlarged temple. We must match God&#8217;s enlargement.<p>Not only was there enlargement in size and weight, but also an increase in the constituents of the temple. We have seen how in the former tabernacle there was only one kind of wood-acacia. But in the temple there are at least three kinds: There was cypress (fir, 1 Kings 6:15, 34), a tree commonly planted in cemeteries in ancient times. This wood signifies something existing in death, thus typifying the death of Christ. Then there was the cedar from Lebanon (1 Kings 6:15-16), signifying in typology the resurrection, or the resurrected Christ. There was also olive wood (1 Kings 6:31). The olive tree supplied the oil, and oil is a type of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, this tree signifies the Christ who gives us the Spirit. From these three kinds of wood we experience Christ in death, in resurrection, and as the Holy Spirit.<p>There was also a greater quantity of gold used in the temple. The entire temple was overlaid with gold (1 Kings 6:20-22). In addition, there were many varieties of stones, and they were large stones. The entire temple building was composed of stones. In the building of God stones signify transformation. A precious stone is not an element originally created by God, but an entity which has been wrought upon and brought into being over a period of time. We human beings were originally composed of clay, but now by the work of the Holy Spirit we are being transformed into something precious.<p>In the church life there are the real experiences of Christ in death, in resurrection, and as the Holy Spirit. There is also the experience of the pure gold, the divine nature of God being added to us, and the experience of constant transformation. It is by such experiences that we become adequate materials for God&#8217;s building. We should not have a large expression, yet only a small experience of Christ. We must have an enlargement as well as an increase of our experiences of Christ that we may match the enlarged expression. The ark, Christ Himself, can never be enlarged-He is continually the same. But we must grow in our experiences of Him.<h2 class=head2>c) The Meaning of Size and Weight</h2><p>A final matter for us to learn from God&#8217;s way of recovery and enlargement is seen in the pattern of the temple. When God gave Moses the vision of the tabernacle, He revealed mainly the size of the tabernacle and its utensils, with the weight of a few of the items included. But in the pattern of the temple, David was given all the sizes and weights of the vessels within the temple (1 Chron. 28:11-19). David saw in the vision not only the sizes of the vessels, but also their weight. The principle we must learn here is that in the church life there are all kinds of gifts and functions, and all must be properly proportioned. The different aspects of the experiences of Christ must be in very good proportion and balance. Some Christians today just stress one thing, such as speaking in tongues. They make the tongue bigger than the whole body! This is a real problem. Other Christians pay attention only to knowledge, studying Hebrew and Greek day by day. They have a giant head, entirely out of proportion with the rest of the body. Some so-called churches emphasize the need of going to the mission fields, thus lengthening their feet out of all proportion. Others stress all kinds of activities-all they have are two big hands which work and toil strenuously. In all these cases some part is overly enlarged and the body is diminutive. The situation today among the Lord&#8217;s people and in the so-called churches is all out of proportion and balance.<p>In some places I have observed a few dear brothers who have really learned something of fellowshipping with the Lord. To them nothing is more important than one&#8217;s fellowship with the Lord. Whenever they see others studying the Scriptures together they tell them to forget that, for study is useless. If they should observe some serving as ushers in a meeting, they would tell them to abandon that and just learn to fellowship with the Lord. They emphasize fellowship to such an extent that they care for nothing else. Everything in the Body, in the church life, must be balanced and in proper proportion. Consider our wonderful human body: it has so many different members, yet it is so balanced. We have two hands, two ears, two eyes, etc., yet everything is properly proportioned. If a man only had two eyes like the headlights of an automobile, he would be a monster. Praise the Lord that in the vision given to him David not only saw the size of the vessels, but also their weight. All the spiritual experiences of Christ in the church life must be balanced and in good proportion. There is a place for speaking in tongues, for knowledge, for serving the Lord and for going to the mission field, but all these experiences must be in good proportion.<h2 class=head1>TWO ASPECTS OF CHRIST SEEN IN DAVID AND SOLOMON</h2><p>David and Solomon, the two men vitally related to the building of the temple, were both types of Christ, representing Him in two aspects. David typified the suffering Christ, and Solomon typified the resurrected Christ, the Christ of glory. Christ from His incarnation to crucifixion was typified by David, and Christ from His resurrection to His enthronement was typified by Solomon. Everything necessary for the building up of the temple was prepared by David-this means that everything necessary for the building up of the church was prepared by the suffering Christ. The actual building of the temple was accomplished by Solomon-this means that the real building of the church is accomplished by the resurrected Christ. In chapter 2 of John&#8217;s gospel, Christ told the Jews, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (v. 19). This means that Christ builds the church in resurrection.<p>Some Bible teachers give the wrong impression by saying that Solomon typifies only the Christ who will come again in glory. Others teach that when Christ returns, He will then build the church. Such teaching strongly implies that this present age is not the era for the building up of the church, but instead the time for the preparing of the materials. The result of this teaching is that no attention is given to the present building up of the church, since that is expected to be accomplished in the future. This kind of teaching is seriously mistaken. Solomon not only typifies the returning Christ, but also the Christ of resurrection. The resurrection of Christ is not future; it has already been accomplished. We are indeed waiting for the second coming of Christ, but we are presently in the period of the resurrected Christ. If the building of the church is to be accomplished in the next dispensation, then what was it that took place on the day of Pentecost? Was that just the preparation of the materials? No! There was a real building up of the church at that time. The apostles in their writings were very definite and strong at that time concerning the building up of the church in this age (1 Cor. 3:10, 12; Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5). We must be clear that by His suffering and death, Christ prepared all the materials; and now, in His resurrection, Christ is building the church.<p>All the degradation and failure of the church could not and will not defeat the Lord. It just opens and paves the way for the Lord to accomplish something even more wonderful. Praise the Lord, we are not disappointed! Many have come to me lamenting the degradation existing among the Lord&#8217;s people today. I have reminded some of them of the principle shown in Genesis 1. There it does not mention morning and evening, but evening and then morning. If every morning brings us only to an evening, we would really have ground for disappointment. But the Lord&#8217;s work is always in the evening and then in the morning. To us, evening just ushers in a morning! Oh, may we read the Scriptures again! The Lord is not backsliding; He is marching on, from Genesis to Revelation! Of course, the marching takes us through some valleys, but we must not remain in the valleys. We must continue marching on with the Lord-eventually we will hit the glorious goal. Regardless of the disappointments, we have full assurance that we will reach the goal. Regardless of how many evenings there are, we will finally have a full, eternal morning!<p>Praise the Lord for these Old Testament pictures. By the time of the building up of the temple, God was marching on more gloriously than at the time the tabernacle was completed. By comparing these two phases of building, we see God&#8217;s way of recovery and enlargement. The Lord is still marching on!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE STRUGGLE OVER GOD&#8217;S BUILDING AND FURTHER ENLARGEMENT</h1><p>From the six Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Samuel through 1 and 2 Chronicles we see another principle-God&#8217;s building always involves a struggle, a real battle. When God has done something, the enemy always attempts to damage and destroy God&#8217;s work. The pleasant prospect, the glorious condition, never lasts too long; that is, not until we reach the ultimate goal. During this process of time, over the ages, there is a continuous struggle. Satan will not allow the good prospect of God&#8217;s building to remain.<p>History shows how God&#8217;s enemy came in to damage and desolate God&#8217;s temple not long after it was finished (2 Chron. 12:1-2; 24:4-5, 7, 12-13; 29:2-7, 16-17; 34:8, 10-11). Not only did he damage the temple, but eventually Satan sent the Chaldeans, the Babylonians, to completely destroy God&#8217;s building. They took away all the vessels of the temple and then burned God&#8217;s house (2 Chron. 36:17-19). The city out of which Abraham was called was in Babylon. The book of Revelation reveals that up to the very last age before God&#8217;s ultimate consummation these two cities will be in existence, Jerusalem and Babylon; and Babylon is always in opposition to Jerusalem. Abraham was separated from Babylon, and his descendants eventually built God&#8217;s building. But God&#8217;s enemy came also from Babylon to destroy this building. The destruction inflicted upon Jerusalem by the Babylonians was not perpetrated merely by human hands, but by the enemy, Satan. Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, had captured all the vessels related to the temple and the worship of God and brought them to Babylon, where he put them in a temple of idols (Ezra 1:7; Dan. 1:1-2). This was a great blasphemy to the Lord. Thus it is evident that this fight was not merely between the Babylonians and the Jewish people, but between Satan and God.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION FOR THIS EARTH</h2><p>We must remember that God&#8217;s intention is to recover this earth from His enemy. Through His chosen people, especially through men like David and Solomon, God regained at least a portion of this earth. He recovered some ground upon which He could place His feet, where He could glorify Himself, express Himself, and exercise His authority upon this earth. It is in this way that God becomes the Lord, not only of the heavens, but also of the earth. Because God had gained a place on this earth through His people, He could be called the Lord of earth as well as the Lord of the heavens. Today, God is eager to recover the entire earth.<p>When Satan sent the army of Babylon to destroy the temple, that meant, spiritually speaking, that he came to force God out of His position on this earth. By reading all the books of the captivity, such as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel, we notice a very interesting fact: in all of these books God is always called &#8220;the God of heaven,&#8221; not the God of heaven and earth (Ezra 1:2; 7:12, 21, 23; Neh. 1:4, 5; 2:4; Dan. 2:18, 28). In a sense, God had been chased away from this earth. God had lost the ground to exercise His authority on this earth, for it had been captured by His enemy. The temple was destroyed, the ground was lost, and God withdrew from earth to heaven. God again became the God of heaven, rather than the God of heaven and earth.<p>Satan&#8217;s intention is ever to chase God from the earth. God&#8217;s intention is to have a building on the earth, a Bethel, a gate to heaven, a place where God can put His feet to exercise His authority. We must see from history that whenever there is a person or a group of persons on this earth who will take a stand for God, at that time God is called the God of heaven and earth. In Genesis, when Abraham defeated the five kings, Melchisedek the priest came out to meet him. At that time God was called the &#8220;possessor of heaven and earth&#8221; (Gen. 14:19), because at that time there was at least one person on this earth who could be the gate of heaven. Abraham brought heaven down to this earth. God could boast because of Abraham that He was the possessor not only of the heavens, but also of the earth. He had some ground upon which to exercise His authority. Later in history, when the people of Israel crossed the Jordan, the priests who carried the ark stepped into the waters and remained there. At that time, God was called &#8220;the Lord of all the earth&#8221; (Josh. 3:11). There were some people on this earth standing with God, and through these people God gained the position to exercise His authority on the earth. However, in all the later books which record Israel&#8217;s captivity, God is always called the God of heaven. Apparently speaking, God had been chased away from this earth by the failure of His people.<p>The New Testament records that one day while the Lord Jesus was on the earth He prayed, &#8220;I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth...&#8221; (Matt. 11:25). Again, through the man Jesus, God had ground on the earth. So many Christians today desire to go to heaven, but God desires to come down to this earth. Heaven is so precious to some, but to God this earth is precious. We should sympathize with God. We should not say, &#8220;Let the church life be in the heavens.&#8221; We should say that the church must be on this earth today.<p>Hallelujah, God can never be defeated! After the Israelites had been in captivity for seventy years, the struggle was again openly manifested. God had been patient long enough; so He fought back. He stirred up His people to return to Jerusalem. The two books of Ezra and Nehemiah record a very interesting phrase-&#8220;unto Jerusalem&#8221; (Ezra 1:11; 7:7; 8:31; Neh. 2:11). God&#8217;s way of recovery always involves a return to the original, proper ground of worship. Today we cannot say, &#8220;There is not any difference; God is omnipresent, God is everywhere. If God is in Jerusalem, He must also be in Babylon.&#8221; Yes, God is everywhere, yet you must leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem.<p>If we would realize God&#8217;s recovery today, we must leave Babylon. Babylon is the very element which damages God&#8217;s building; we must abandon it and return to Jerusalem. There is only one ground for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We must return to the old standing of the proper ground, in Jerusalem. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah record the real struggle involved over Israel&#8217;s return to Jerusalem. For the Israelites to have God&#8217;s building in Babylon was quite all right-all their enemies agreed concerning this. But for them to return to Jerusalem was another matter. The situation is exactly the same today: the battle between God and His enemy is mainly over the matter of Christians returning to the church ground, the ground of unique unity. We must return to &#8220;Jerusalem.&#8221;<p>In God&#8217;s way of recovery the most important thing is to recover the ground. When the Israelites returned to Jerusalem, one of their first projects was to rebuild the altar upon its original base (Ezra 3:3). The Israelites could have built another altar in the same shape and style, using the same material, and put it in a place other than its original site in Jerusalem; but that would be wrong. The altar must be on the proper base, the proper ground in Jerusalem. Some Israelites might have built a temple in Babylon, using the same pattern, the same size, the same precious materials, and the same color as the temple in Jerusalem; but God would never have recognized that temple. It would be the same in every respect except for one vital factor-it would be on a different ground, a different standing. In the recovery of the church life the first thing to which we must pay attention is the old ground, the original standing. We must not say, &#8220;Let us build a temple here in Babylon, in Egypt, or in Syria.&#8221; No! We cannot do that. We must return to Jerusalem, to the old ground, to the original standing of God&#8217;s building.<p>The book of Nehemiah records how the enemy stirred up an intense struggle to frustrate the Israelites from God&#8217;s building. After they began to build, they were openly attacked (Neh. 4). The enemy&#8217;s only intention was to stop the recovery of God&#8217;s building. Another tactic of the enemy was to utilize some people to suggest a conference (Neh. 6:2). Even so there are some today who say, &#8220;Please come; let us sit down together and talk it over.&#8221; We must see through these subtle wiles of the enemy. We must tell them as Nehemiah did, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for a conference; I am too busy building.&#8221; People may accuse you of never desiring to discuss the matter and have fellowship with others. But we want to have positive fellowship; we do not want to waste our time; we do not want to be frustrated from the recovery of the building. How subtle the enemy is in his attempts to frustrate us from God&#8217;s building. The Israelites who worked in the building with Nehemiah labored with one hand to build and in the other hand held their weapons for fighting the battle (Neh. 4:17). This reveals that whenever we labor on God&#8217;s building we will certainly be involved in battle.<p>These historical books also show us what happens when we neglect the recovery of God&#8217;s building. The Lord says in Haggai that when we neglect His house to do our own labor and sow our own seed, the result will only be emptiness. We may eat continually but we will still be empty. We may drink constantly, yet we will not be filled. We may gain something by our labor, but the Lord will blow it away. We may earn some wages and put them away in a bag as our savings, but the bag will be full of holes (Hag. 1:2-11). If we neglect the building of God&#8217;s temple, we will lose the blessing of God. If we give our full attention to the recovery of the church life today, being willing to be built up together, we will attain this building. Whenever we go out to preach the gospel, many will be saved. The blessing of the Lord will be upon whatever we do. On the other hand, if we neglect God&#8217;s house, the building up of the church, no matter what we do the end results will be very poor. We may sow the seed, but there will be no lasting fruit. We may gain something, but eventually it will be gone. There will be no satisfaction. Many of us can verify these things. The Lord warns us that we must pay attention to His house first. If we would attend to the church life and be built up in our locality, we will see the Lord&#8217;s abundant blessing upon us.<p>About ten years ago the church in Taipei set aside several days specifically for gospel meetings. The gospel was preached in at least five or six meeting places during the same evening. After several days of meetings, a person from a Christian organization came to me and inquired, &#8220;Brother, would you please tell me the secret!&#8221; When I asked him what he meant, he told how his group had held some gospel meetings several weeks before. They had put a large advertisement in the newspaper, and they had invited a well-known speaker. Yet every night their turnout was little more than ten people and never over twenty. Now this gentleman had visited all the meeting places of the local church for just a few minutes each night. He was exceedingly surprised to see every place full of people. He knew that there had been no advertisement in the newspapers and that before each meeting not many knew who was to be the speaker. I could not adequately explain the situation to this brother, and if I could pass on to him the methods, they would not work for his group. Why? Because this brother had simply neglected the church life. He trusted in advertising and famous speakers, yet he neglected God&#8217;s building.<p>How much we need God&#8217;s recovery today! We must be built up together as one church in each city; then we will have God&#8217;s blessing. However, we must realize that we will suffer for such a building. The enemy will attack us over this matter more than anything else. He will do everything he can to damage us, spreading all kinds of rumors and lies, for no other reason than to hinder or stop the recovery of God&#8217;s building. Yet the Lord is victorious. Praise Him!<h2 class=head1>THE ORDER OF RECOVERY</h2><p>According to the record of Nehemiah, the recovery was eventually accomplished, not only a recovery of the temple, but also a complete rebuilding of the city. Ezra records the rebuilding of the temple, and Nehemiah tells of the recovery of the city. The temple signifies the expression of God, while the city signifies the authority or kingdom of God. The city protected the temple; the kingdom is the protection of God&#8217;s expression. When Satan through the Babylonians assaulted Jerusalem, they first destroyed the city, then they had the liberty to demolish the temple. The order of God&#8217;s recovery is first that the altar must be recovered (Ezra 3:2), then God&#8217;s house (Ezra 3:8-13), and finally the city (Neh. 2:18). The altar was the very place where the people could offer and consecrate to God. Even so, today we must first recover the ground of consecration. We must recover a place for the people of God to offer themselves and all they have to God. Following this, we must recover the expression of the temple, God&#8217;s house. Then, for protection, we must recover the city. The two books of Ezra and Nehemiah reveal this order of God&#8217;s recovery.<p>At the end of Scripture, in the book of Revelation, we see the city and the temple mingled together as one building. Together they are called the tabernacle (Rev. 21:3). The New Jerusalem, the Holy City, is also the tabernacle of God on this earth. There is no temple in the Holy City (Rev. 21:22), because the city itself is the temple. Today, however, our first need is to recover the altar, then the house, and then the city.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S RECOVERY IN THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL</h2><p>If we would see a full picture of God&#8217;s building, we must also consider the book of Ezekiel. This portion of Scripture has nine chapters (ch. 40-48) dealing with the subject of the recovery of God&#8217;s temple. During the seventy year period of the captivity of the Israelites, Ezekiel was shown a vision from God. In the spirit he was brought back to the elevated land of Canaan, where he saw another temple. We must realize that historically, between the time of Solomon&#8217;s temple and this temple seen by Ezekiel, another temple was recovered by the Israelites who had returned to Jerusalem. The captivity of the Israelites occurred in 606 B.C., and Ezekiel saw the vision of God&#8217;s recovery in 574 B.C. The recovery of the temple by the Israelites after their captivity was accomplished in 536 B.C. Ezekiel witnessed a full recovery of God&#8217;s building in the spirit. That recovery was begun according to Ezra&#8217;s record, but the recovery of the destroyed temple has not yet been fully accomplished. In Ezra&#8217;s account of the recovered temple there were no measurements given, but Ezekiel saw the measurements of the temple in his vision. We have previously indicated that in God&#8217;s recovery there is always an enlargement. In the recovery of Solomon&#8217;s temple there was a very apparent enlargement. But in the records of Ezra and Nehemiah, there is no apparent enlargement. But if we have foresight to see things through to the end, we will realize that this recovery of God&#8217;s temple has not yet been fully accomplished. It is still in process. The temple built during Ezra&#8217;s time was replaced by Herod&#8217;s temple, which was built in forty-six years (John 2:20). The Lord Jesus came to the earth during the historical period of Herod&#8217;s temple. But neither the temple in Ezra&#8217;s day nor the temple of Herod&#8217;s time was the full recovery of the temple Solomon had built. The temple of Ezekiel&#8217;s vision, however, is the more than full recovery of Solomon&#8217;s temple, which had been destroyed. Most Bible students agree that Ezekiel&#8217;s vision was to some degree a prophecy which will be fulfilled in the future.<p>When we compare the temple in Ezekiel with the temple built by Solomon, we see a further, tremendous enlargement. Here are just a few items of this enlargement: firstly, there is both an outer court and an inner court (Ezek. 40)-two courts. The wall of each court is six cubits thick. Since one cubit is judged to equal approximately one and a half feet, the wall is exceedingly thick. The height of the wall is also six cubits. Thus, a cross-section of the wall would be six by six. In typology this is none other than the Lord Jesus in His humanity. Jesus Christ is the separating wall of the temple seen by Ezekiel. In the wall of the outer court there are three gates, and in the wall of the inner court there are three more gates, making a total of six gates. At each gate there is a threshold in front, then a passageway, and finally an inner threshold. In each passageway there are six little chambers, three on each side. We see already a considerable increase and enlargement over Solomon&#8217;s temple. All these items are related to the increased experiences of Christ. At each corner of Ezekiel&#8217;s temple there are thirty rooms, in which we may enjoy Christ. Oh, this is exceedingly rich! There are also many items in the inner court which we have not mentioned.<p>Eventually, Ezekiel takes us into the temple itself (Ezek. 41). Of course, this temple is the same size as the one built by Solomon, but there are many additional attachments. On three sides of the temple are side chambers in three stories, each story having thirty rooms. These chambers portray the fullness of Christ. Then, at the rear of the temple, is another very large building. Oh, how great a fullness! Oh the riches in this temple! Yet we must realize that this is still not God&#8217;s ultimate building. The ultimate building of God is the New Jerusalem.<p>The New Jerusalem is a three dimensional city. It is full and square, twelve thousand stadia square. The stadia, an ancient measurement of length used by the Greeks, is thought to be similar to our length of three feet. The New Jerusalem will be twelve thousand stadia in the three dimensions of length, width and height (Rev. 21:16). By way of enlargement it is overwhelming. The wall alone will be one hundred and forty-four cubits high (Rev. 21:17), or twelve times twelve. All the dimensions are divisible by twelve. There will be twelve foundations, twelve gates, twelve months, twelve apostles, and twelve tribes-many twelves. This number is not constituted of three plus four, but three multiplied by four. It is not merely something of man plus God, but man mingled with God in eternity. This will be the ultimate manifestation of God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE PROGRESS OF THE ENLARGEMENT OF GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>In conclusion, let us briefly look at the progress in the enlargement of God&#8217;s building throughout Scripture. In the first stage there was something very small, as a building in miniature: there were the tents of Noah and Abraham with an altar. The tents of Noah and Abraham were exceedingly small, and their altars were very elementary. The altars at which Noah and Abraham worshipped were undoubtedly crude, being composed probably of just a few stones put together. That was the first stage of God&#8217;s building; it was but a miniature shadow. In the second stage there was the tabernacle with the brazen altar. This was quite an enlargement over the tent and altar. Then, in the third stage, there was Solomon&#8217;s temple with its brass altar (2 Chron. 4:1). Both this temple and the altar were more solid and of greater increase and enlargement. In Ezekiel&#8217;s vision there was an even more greatly enlarged temple with a wonderful altar (Ezek. 43:13-17) at the very center of the premises of the temple (Ezek. 40:47). However, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate manifestation of God&#8217;s building and the greatest enlargement of all.<p>It is interesting to note that when Abraham was living in his small tent, he was living in the first stage of God&#8217;s building, but he was looking for its last stage, the city which had foundations (Heb. 11:10). Do you see this vision of the continual increase in the enlargement of God&#8217;s building? Oh, the entire Scriptures are a record of building. God&#8217;s building is nothing but man mingled with God and God mingled with man. It began with a little tent and altar, then throughout history it came more and more into shape, until eventually and ultimately it will become the New Jerusalem, for which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were all looking!<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S BUILDING PORTRAYED IN THE PSALMS</h2><p>Before closing the record of the Old Testament and proceeding to the New, let us consider three Psalms which show the appreciation some of the Old Testament saints had for God&#8217;s building.<p>First let us consider the very familiar twenty-third Psalm. The subject of this Psalm is in verse one: &#8220;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.&#8221; Each of the five verses following reveal a successive stage of spiritual experience. The first stage is that of green pastures and still waters. We all enjoy being in the green pastures and drinking the still waters: both of these experiences are the different aspects of the experience of the riches of Christ. But the steps in this Psalm show that seeking Christians are those who go on after they have enjoyed the riches of the Lord. The green pastures and still waters are just the initial experiences of Christ; they are the stage of childhood. After enjoying the riches of Christ, the Psalmist goes on to the second stage, where he is led through the paths of righteousness for the sake of the Lord&#8217;s name. Then we come to the third stage, the valley of the shadow of death. While we are walking in the paths of righteousness, we will pass through the valley of the shadow of death; but we will fear no evil, for the Lord is with us. His rod and His staff will comfort us. In the fourth stage the Lord prepares a table for us in the presence of our enemies. This stage involves a battlefield; but even in the place of battle, we will enjoy something of the Lord as a feast in a more complete way. Our enjoyment of the Lord in the first stage, in the green pastures and still waters, is very elementary and rather rough. In the fourth stage our enjoyment is more rich and full. Our enjoyment here becomes a table, where the Lord anoints our head with oil and our cup overflows. Yet this is not the ultimate. In the final stage goodness and mercy follow us all the days of our life, and we dwell in the house of the Lord forever! The house of the Lord is clearly set forth as the fifth and ultimate stage in our experience of the Lord.<p>In this Psalm we have seen five kinds of environment: firstly, the green pastures with still waters; secondly, the paths of righteousness; thirdly, the valley of the shadow of death; fourthly, the battlefield; and fifthly, the house of the Lord. Oh, we must go on to hit this mark and attain this goal; we must go on until one day we remain in the house of the Lord forever. This experience of the building of God is the ultimate and fullest of all spiritual experiences. May we continue on until we fully realize this stage of God&#8217;s building!<p>Now look briefly at Psalm 27. In verse 4 the Psalmist said, &#8220;One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple.&#8221; The temple of God is the only thing the Old Testament seeking ones were after. Their feelings, their affections, and their appreciation were for God&#8217;s house.<p>Finally, we come to Psalm 84, which says, &#8220;How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!&#8221; (v. 1). Verse 4 continues, &#8220;Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee.&#8221; And verse 10 says, &#8220;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.&#8221; If we would really redeem the time, it is best to dwell in the house of God, for one day there will redeem a thousand days elsewhere. The Psalmist continues, &#8220;I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.&#8221; If he could not dwell in the house of God, the Psalmist would be satisfied to be even a doorkeeper of that house. This reveals the appreciation the Old Testament saints had for the Lord&#8217;s building, and we have looked at only a few psalms. Again, this proves that the building of God is the central thought of the Old Testament.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE BUILDING OF GOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><p>We have seen how the building of God is continually being enlarged, step by step. It began with a little tent and altar, but the ultimate manifestation will be an immense city, the New Jerusalem, a building of three dimensions. The New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle of God with man. In Revelation 21 the Apostle John says: &#8220;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem...and I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them&#8221; (vv. 2-3). The word &#8220;dwell&#8221; in the Greek text is the verb form of the noun &#8220;tabernacle.&#8221; God will tabernacle with us. The New Jerusalem is a tent, a tabernacle. Noah and Abraham&#8217;s small tents portrayed in Genesis were the seed, and the New Jerusalem is the final harvest of that seed. This principle of increase and enlargement is clearly seen in the Scriptures.<h2 class=head1>JESUS CHRIST AS GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>Now we shall consider God&#8217;s building in the New Testament. The Gospel of John says, &#8220;And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us&#8221; (1:14). Again the word &#8220;dwelt&#8221; is the verb form of the noun &#8220;tabernacle.&#8221; The meaning of the Lord Jesus being incarnated as a man is that He tabernacled among us. Now we realize how the entire Old Testament is necessary to explain the meaning of this one vital word. If we read John 1:14 according to the Greek text without a knowledge of the Old Testament, we will not understand the full meaning of the word &#8220;tabernacle.&#8221; It is simply the mingling of God with man. Divinity and humanity became a mutual habitation. The tabernacle, the dwelling-place of God, was not the dwelling-place of God alone. From the Psalms we see that the temple or the tabernacle was also the dwelling-place for all who sought God. It was a mutual habitation of God with man.<p>The Apostle John points out that the Word became flesh. What was the Word? The Word was God (John 1:1), and God came into the flesh, the human nature of man. This simply means that divinity was mingled with humanity-this is the true tabernacle. John 1:14 continues, &#8220;He tabernacled among us (and we beheld his glory...).&#8221; Even as the people of Israel had seen God&#8217;s glory fill the old tabernacle, now the Apostles of Christ saw the glory, &#8220;glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.&#8221; Later, at the end of the same chapter, the Lord Jesus told the true Israelite, Nathanael: &#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man&#8221; (v. 51). This chapter is exceedingly meaningful. In the first verse there is the Word, who is God Himself, and in the last verse there is the Son of man. God Himself became the Son of man. The Word speaks of something in eternity past-&#8220;In the beginning was the Word.&#8221; But the Son of man speaks of eternity future. Oh, eternity is required to explain this fact! In eternity past there was only God, but in eternity future divinity will be mingled with humanity in the Son of man. In eternity past there was nothing of humanity in God, but in eternity future there will be God Himself as the Son of man, full of the human nature. Divinity will be wholly mingled with humanity.<p>The essential point of John 1:51 is the open heaven with the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. Do you remember Jacob&#8217;s dream? Our Lord was speaking to a group of people who knew the Old Testament quite well. When He addressed Nathanael, both he and the others around him knew what the Lord meant. Jacob&#8217;s dream had two items, an open heaven and a ladder joining heaven and earth, upon which the angels ascended and descended. This ladder was the Son of man. Notice here the order: first ascending and then descending. That means that something was going to heaven from earth and then returning to earth again. Why did the Lord Jesus refer to these things at the beginning? To point out that He came for the one purpose of having heaven opened to the earth and that on this earth He, the Son of man, will be the very element joining heaven and earth together. This is the ladder of Jacob&#8217;s dream. With that dream there was Bethel, the house of God, composed of a stone upon which oil had been poured. That stone with oil poured upon it signified the mingling of God with man. Thus, the Son of man is the exact fulfillment of that dream. In Him, heaven is opened to earth, and earth is joined to heaven. In Him is Bethel, God mingled with man.<p>What is the Son of man? He is the tabernacle. The first chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel is indeed marvelous. To comprehend it we must understand these items: the Word, God Himself, and this Word who is God Himself becoming flesh, tabernacling, or mingling Himself with man. This is the Son of man, and this is God&#8217;s building. The building of God is the mingling of God with man and man with God. The building means that God builds Himself into us and builds us into Himself. The Old Testament descriptions of the oil poured upon the stone and the gold overlaying the boards simply signify divinity being mingled with humanity. This is the basic meaning of God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH, THE ENLARGEMENT OF GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>In the second chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel the Jews asked the Lord Jesus, &#8220;What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?&#8221; The Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?&#8221; But the Lord spoke of the temple of His body (2:18-21). In the first chapter of John the Lord Jesus is the tabernacle. Now He is revealed as the temple. We may apprehend the meaning of the temple from our previous study of the Old Testament. We should also recall here the struggle over God&#8217;s building, for in this chapter the struggle appears again. The enemy, Satan, utilized the Jews to destroy the temple, the Lord Jesus Himself. But the Lord told the Jews that if they destroyed this temple, it would be raised up in three days. The Jews destroyed only one person on the cross, but the Lord raised up millions of people with Him in His resurrection. The more the enemy destroys, the more the Lord enlarges. The enemy destroyed one &#8220;little&#8221; Jesus, but the Lord raised up millions in His resurrection. Ephesians 2:6 says clearly that we were raised up together with Christ. (See also 1 Peter 1:3.) Since we were resurrected with Christ, we have all become members of His Body, the church, God&#8217;s temple. The temple raised up by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus includes the Lord Himself with all the members of His Body, the church. This is really an enlarged temple!<h2 class=head1>CHRIST, THE MATERIAL FOR GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>Another aspect in the New Testament of the Lord Jesus as God&#8217;s building is the rock, first mentioned in Matthew 16. Most Christians realize that the Lord Jesus is a rock. The Lord is represented by many different types of stone. He is the cornerstone. In Matthew 21:42, the Lord asked: &#8220;Did ye never read in the scriptures. The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner?&#8221; Here the Lord refers to God&#8217;s building. It is exceedingly clear that this stone is for the building, and the Lord Jesus is this stone. Ephesians 2:20 clearly says that we are &#8220;built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone.&#8221; The chief cornerstone is that stone which joins the two walls of a building together. Chapter 2 of Ephesians reveals the Jewish believers as one wall in one direction, and the Gentile believers as another wall in another direction. But the Lord Jesus is at the corner to join these two walls together. He is the cornerstone joining the Jews and Gentiles together into one building for God.<p>In the Old Testament the Lord Jesus is also portrayed as the foundation stone: &#8220;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone of sure foundation&#8221; (Isa. 28:16). He is also the topstone, or cap stone, for Zechariah 4:7 says, &#8220;Who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace unto it.&#8221; Today we need fear no kind of frustration, for the mountain will become a plain. What is the topstone? In Palestine the Jewish buildings have flat roofs. Each building has a foundation stone and a cornerstone; then, when the building is nearly finished, the builders put on the topstone, the roof. That means that the building is done. Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone. Every part of the building is Christ!<p>The Lord Jesus is also the living stone, the precious stone, and the tried stone (1 Pet. 2:4). In Zechariah 3:9, He is spoken of as a stone with seven eyes. Revelation 4:5 indicates that these seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God, or the sevenfold Spirit of God. In Romans 9:33 the Lord is the stone of stumbling, and in Matthew 21:44 (King James Version) He is the grinding stone: &#8220;And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.&#8221;<p>Altogether, Christ is a stone of ten aspects: the foundation, the cornerstone, the topstone, the tried stone, the precious stone, the living stone, the stone with seven eyes, the stumbling stone, the grinding stone, and the rock. All these aspects are related to the building of God. Not only is this stone a building, but it will also become a high mountain. Daniel 2:35 says, &#8220;Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&#8221; The worldly, political powers will be carried away as the chaff by the wind. The mountain in this verse is the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God. As a stone, Christ is good not only for the building up of the temple, God&#8217;s house, but also for the building up of the city, the kingdom. Daniel 2:45 continues: &#8220;Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter.&#8221; This stone, which was cut out of the mountain without hands, is Christ Himself.<p>Many Christians have never realized how these verses portray God&#8217;s building. Christ as all these various types of stone is just for God&#8217;s building. First, we must realize that He was the Word of God, God Himself. Then one day He became flesh, being incarnated as a man. That means that the process of God&#8217;s actual building had begun. The divine nature was built together with the human nature. Before the incarnation, God was God and man was man; but by the incarnation God was brought into man, and man was brought into God. These two natures mingled as one compose the building. When the &#8220;little man&#8221; Jesus was on this earth, He was the one Person, the one man, with God within Him. In Jesus, God was built with man as one building. Now God could dwell in man, and man could dwell in God; something was built up. That which was built was the Word of God, who became the Son of man, the One who is the very ladder joining heaven and earth together as the Bethel of God. These things are profound!<p>This Bethel, this mingling of God with man and man with God, had to be reproduced, and this was accomplished by death and resurrection. Before the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, there was only one Person on the entire earth who constituted God&#8217;s building. But by His death and resurrection, millions of parts of God&#8217;s building have been reproduced, thus greatly enlarging it. Christ Himself is the foundation of this enlarged building, as well as the cornerstone and the topstone to complete the building. After His resurrection, He became the sure foundation of the enlarged building. And as the cornerstone He is the joining and holding power of the building. Finally, as the topstone, He puts the finishing touch upon the building. He is living and precious, and He has been tried. He is a sure foundation. If you trust in Him, you will be built upon Him as a part of God&#8217;s building. But if you are against Him, you will either stumble and be broken upon Him, or He will grind you to powder.<h2 class=head1>THE APPLICATION OF MATTHEW 16:18</h2><p>Have you ever thought that since you have believed in Jesus Christ you must be built up? I have seen very few Christians who have ever had this concept. We do not naturally conceive of it. However, the Scriptures clearly show that to believe in Jesus Christ means to be built upon Him. Matthew 16:18 contains the first mention of the church in the New Testament. Simon Peter had told the Lord Jesus, &#8220;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,&#8221; and Jesus answered and said unto him, &#8220;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter [a stone], and upon this rock [Christ] I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&#8221; I believe that this passage indicates Peter&#8217;s salvation, for at that time Peter recognized and believed that the Lord Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God. Following this, the Lord told him that he was a stone; he was no longer just a piece of clay. Then the Lord referred to Himself as the very rock upon which He would build His church. Peter was a stone for that building. This matter is almost completely neglected by Christianity today, but the Lord is recovering this reality. All we who have been saved must realize that our salvation means we must be built up. Christ is the rock, and we are the stones. Christ is for God&#8217;s building, and we are all for God&#8217;s building. If we believe in Him, it means that we will be built up in Him and built up with Him in God&#8217;s building. It is the built-up church that all the powers of darkness rise up to attack. Wherever and whenever the church is built up, all hell is stirred in opposition; but against the built-up church the gates of hades will never prevail.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS LIFE FOR THE BUILDING</h1><p>The writings of the Apostle John have a special place in the Scriptures. His Gospel is unique among the four Gospels, and Revelation, his last book, is the conclusion of the New Testament and of the entire Bible. In these two books there are two words which are the key words not only to these books, but also to the whole of Scripture-they are life and building. In the beginning of Scripture there is a tree called the tree of life, and at the end of Scripture there is a city, a building. It is very clear that the building issues from the life. The life is for the building, and the building comes out of the life. This life is the Triune God. The Triune God is life to us that the eternal building may be realized. These two words summarize the whole revelation of Scripture.<h2 class=head1>THE DEFINITION OF LIFE AND BUILDING</h2><p>In the Gospel of John, life and light are referred to continually. The end result of the life mentioned in John&#8217;s Gospel is found in the book of Revelation-that is, the building, the city. In the center of this building is the tree of life, growing in the flow of the living water, to nourish and supply the entire city. Thus, the last picture in Scripture reveals that the life is in the building. This life is God in Christ as the Spirit flowing out as life to us.<p>John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. According to this passage, the incarnated Christ is the very tabernacle. In Revelation 21 John saw the holy city and heard a voice out of heaven saying, &#8220;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them.&#8221; In these two books written by the same person, we see two tabernacles. Christ is the tabernacle in John&#8217;s Gospel, and the holy city is the tabernacle in Revelation. The second tabernacle, the New Jerusalem, is the enlargement of the first tabernacle, Christ Himself. There is only one tabernacle, but it is manifested in two stages. In the first stage, from the time of His incarnation to His death, Christ alone was the tabernacle. Then came His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and entering into us as the Spirit, and we were regenerated. Now we are being transformed, and eventually we will be completely transfigured. At that time God&#8217;s work will be completed; that will be the second stage of the tabernacle. The tabernacle of the first stage, the Lord Jesus, will have increased to a tabernacle including millions of persons!<p>In that glorious day, Christ, who was the tabernacle in the first stage, will be the very center of the tabernacle in the second stage. Since Christ is the center in the New Jerusalem, there is no need of the sun or moon or any other kind of light in the city. God Himself is the light, and Christ is the lamp, the vessel to contain the light. As the light, God is the glory, and as the lamp, Christ is the container and expression of the glory. The city itself is a great vessel to contain the lamp. The lamp contains the light, and the city contains the lamp. As an example, we may consider a common light bulb with its shade: first, there is the electricity within the bulb; second, there is the bulb, the container of the electricity; and third, there is the lampshade surrounding the bulb. The New Jerusalem as the lampshade is the enlargement of the lamp. Christ is the tabernacle of God, and the church, the Body of Christ, is the enlargement of the tabernacle.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY OF ENLARGEMENT</h2><p>How may this one tabernacle be so enlarged? If we learn how to properly study the Scripture, we will see the way.<h2 class=head2>The Bride</h2><p>Another expression of this tabernacle is the Bride of the Lamb (Rev. 21:9-10). John 3:29 tells us clearly that Christ will have a Bride. The New Jerusalem is this Bride. Consider the case of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2. We see there how Eve, the bride of Adam, came into being. When God created Adam, He formed just one person from the dust of the ground. Out of Adam He took a part, from which He formed Eve, and He brought her to Adam to be his wife. She was the increase or enlargement of Adam. Strictly speaking, the wife is not a separate person from the husband. Rather, she is the enlargement, the increase of the husband. She is therefore the counterpart of the husband. Thus, the tabernacle is the Bride, the increase of the Bridegroom. John&#8217;s Gospel makes this matter very clear.<h2 class=head2>The Many Grains</h2><p>While the third chapter of John presents the Bridegroom and the Bride, the twelfth chapter reveals the one grain of wheat which is multiplied into many grains. Christ is the one grain which fell into the earth and died. By death and resurrection the one grain is multiplied into many grains. We are the many grains produced from this one grain.<h2 class=head2>The Vine and the Branches</h2><p>Going on from John 12 to John 15, we see one vine with many branches. This chapter reveals the principle of many in oneness. We do not see this thought with the many grains of wheat. A person may divide the grains. He may say, &#8220;I am a grain, whole and entire; I have nothing to do with you.&#8221; All right. But remember, we are also branches, and the branches can never be divided. As a branch, if you have nothing to do with me, you will be dead, for we are all one in the one vine. Here again, the vine typifies the tabernacle in the first stage, and the vine with many branches typifies the enlarged tabernacle in the second stage.<h2 class=head2>The Oneness Formed</h2><p>Let us go on now to John 17. This chapter records the prayer of the Lord Jesus concerning oneness: &#8220;That they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me&#8221; (vv. 21-23). The &#8220;us&#8221; to which the Lord refers in this chapter is He and the Father. In chapter 12 there are the grains, but in this chapter we see the formation of the loaf. As the many grains, we have been formed into one loaf, or one Body (1 Cor. 10:17). Originally there was but one grain; now it has increased into a loaf. The original one grain is included in the many grains, and the many grains have been blended together into one loaf. In chapter 15 the oneness is somewhat apparent, but in chapter 17 the oneness is formed. This oneness which is formed is the enlargement or the second stage of the tabernacle. Our outstanding and desperate need today is to realize how we may become such a tabernacle.<h2 class=head1>HOW WE MAY REALIZE THE ONENESS</h2><h2 class=head2>Receiving Christ as Our Life</h2><p>In order to realize this oneness we must learn how to enjoy Christ as our life, rather than just understand the doctrine concerning Him. We must know how to experience Christ by applying Him as our life and by living in Him. Because we were born of Adam, we are members of Adam. But praise God for the regeneration clearly revealed in John&#8217;s Gospel. John 3:6 says, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh&#8221;-that is something of Adam. However, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221;-this is something of Christ. In the spirit we are a part of Christ, because in the spirit we have been regenerated by Christ and with Christ. Christ was the one grain, and all who have been regenerated of the Spirit have become the many grains of Christ. There are two potential conditions existing in every Christian: in the flesh we have the potential of being the members of Adam, while in the spirit we have the potential of being the members of Christ. In the flesh we live by Adam, but in the spirit we can live by Christ. In the flesh we live as the enlargement of Adam, but in the spirit we live as the enlargement of Christ. Here the secret is revealed: it is to live in the spirit.<h2 class=head2>Mutual Abiding</h2><p>Then we must go on to the reality of John 15: we must abide in Christ and let Him abide in us. First we have life in the spirit, taking Christ as our life. Then we must learn to abide in Christ and let Him abide in us. Such abiding requires the absolute denial of our self-life.<h2 class=head2>The Result of Abiding-The Body Life</h2><p>We have seen that God desires to build us up with Himself by being life to us in Christ. Christ came to be our life that we may have life and that we may have it abundantly (John 10:10). How do we receive this life? This very Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit enters into our spirit at the time we believe. Thus, our spirit is reborn or regenerated of Him. From this time forth He is the Life-giving Spirit in our spirit. We need only learn how to live by this spirit, no longer living by ourself, our flesh. By this spirit we must learn to abide in Christ and let Him abide in us. We need to practice this abiding. If we live in this way, we will realize how much we need the other members. We will have a deep sense that we need others, that we cannot live by ourselves.<p>Christians today like to talk about loving one another, and some do indeed love others. But such love is not that which is mentioned by the Lord Jesus in John 15. Even in human society there is a mutual love which is similar to that of most Christians. The love mentioned in John&#8217;s Gospel results from our abiding in Christ. When we abide in Christ, we sense our need for the other members; thus, we fellowship with others. Likewise, when they abide in Christ, they also sense the deep need of fellowship. Therefore, we have an abundance of mutual fellowship. Spontaneously, then, we love one another. This is the love Jesus referred to in John 15:17. The kind of love manifested among some Christians is not a love for the Body of Christ, for it is not a love which comes out of Christ. When we learn to love not by our self, but by taking Christ as our life in the spirit, and when we learn to abide in Him continually and allow Him to abide in us, immediately we sense that we need the members of the Body. We cannot go on without the church.<h2 class=head1>IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST&#8217;S BODY</h2><p>Sometimes we speak about paying the price or counting the cost for the Body life, the church life. There is indeed a price to pay, but we do not need to speak too much in this way. At least when we are considering the ministry of the Lord Jesus, we should not say much about the price. When we come to Paul&#8217;s ministry we shall see the cost-later we shall refer to this. Presently, we are dwelling on the fact that we are branches of the one vine. Is it a cost, a suffering, to abide in that vine and live by that vine? Oh, this is an enjoyment!<p>It is very questionable whether some so-called brothers and sisters have really been regenerated. They live as if they have become members only of the Christian religion. Of course, that is a real price, a real cost to them. They do not have a new life in their spirit, yet they are expected to have a new living. That is exceedingly difficult. It is like asking a dog to fly. If the dog could gain the bird&#8217;s life, he would need no command to fly; he would fly spontaneously. We must realize that we are regenerated persons, and that this new birth is not a matter of religion. Formerly we were born of the flesh; now we have been born again of the Spirit. This means that the human spirit within us has been regenerated. Now, in our spirit, we have Christ as the Life-giving Spirit, and we must learn how to live by this source, by this Spirit; how to abide in Him and let Him abide in us. Then we will love the church life. We will not say that it is a suffering, but that it is an enjoyment.<p>Birds naturally enjoy flying. Of course, a bird needs to rest at times; but after some rest, it flies again. Sometimes we need a little rest, but if we try to rest very long without meeting together, we deeply sense our need of meeting with the saints. Regardless of whether we eat, drink, sleep, or exercise, we still must go to the meetings of the church. If we are abiding in Christ and He is abiding in us, we will realize the church life. By such mutual abiding, Christ will grow in us, and we will become a part of the increase of Christ. This is the whole message of John&#8217;s Gospel.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that the incarnated Christ is the tabernacle of God, the vessel containing God. This very Christ has come into us, into our spirit, as the seed of life. We must learn to live by Him in our spirit, and not live by our own life in the flesh; then we will enjoy all that He is, and we will deeply sense our need of the other grains, the other branches. We will spontaneously love others, and they will love us; then together we will have the proper church life. In this way, day by day, Christ will grow in us, and we will be transformed from Adam&#8217;s nature into Christ&#8217;s nature. We will gradually be translated from Adam into Christ, and we will be a real part of the increase of Christ. All of us together with Christ will be one in the Spirit, and this will be the real building of God, the real mingling of God with us. This is God&#8217;s dwelling-place, the tabernacle, the temple of God.<p>These things are so simple and clear; we must not make them complicated. We must not merely think of these things, but practically apply them. Christ as the Life-giving Spirit first enters into our spirit, and our spirit is regenerated (John 3). From that time, He is the life within us, He is the strengthening power (John 5), He is the food of life (John 6), He is the living water (John 7), and He is the light within us (John 8). In fact, He is everything to us. But the secret, the one condition, is that we learn to live by Him rather than by our old life. Then we will become a real grain and a real branch of Christ. We will be a grain blended with other grains, and a branch growing with other branches. We will be one in reality with others in the Spirit. This is the enlargement of the tabernacle, and this is the New Jerusalem.<p>In the so-called churches of today we hear too many doctrines, too many messages which do not help us. We must learn to live in the simple way, and help others to live in this way, for then, wherever we are, there will be a wonderful church life, there will be a real building up of the church. Oh, the church life, the real church building, is not realized by organization, gifts, or teaching! It is only realized by taking Christ as our life, living by Him, abiding in Him, and allowing Him to abide in us as the Spirit. This is the unique need today.<p>Most Christians know that the Gospel of John speaks of the matter of life, but how many have seen the building revealed in this Gospel? Remember, the life is for the building. The Lord Jesus told the Jews, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (v. 19). The Lord did build up God&#8217;s temple in resurrection; it is Himself with His Body, the church. This is the building.<p>Some Christians ask how to start or organize a church. We cannot form or organize a church. We can do nothing but learn how to live by Christ, taking Him as our life, and seeking to help others live by this life. If we can do this, the real oneness will be realized, and we will have the church.<h2 class=head1>THE MINISTRY OF MENDING</h2><p>John&#8217;s Gospel is not a book of teachings or gifts. In the Gospel of John and in Revelation as well, we do not see the teachings or the gifts, but the life. John&#8217;s ministry was a ministry of the mending of life. There are many holes in us; there are many broken things which need to be mended. The more gifts we have, the more holes we will have. Gifts bring in the breaks, the divisions. We can only be mended by the ministry of life.<p>First Corinthians speaks of the matter of divisions and shows that the cause of the divisions was the gifts. In 1 Corinthians Paul says that the Corinthian believers were behind in no gifts (1:7). They had all the gifts; they paid too much attention to the gifts and overused the gifts; therefore there were divisions. They needed the ministry of mending, and the Apostle Paul ministered to them in this way. Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians is the ministry of mending, the mending by love in life. The breaks and holes must be mended by love in life. Though we may speak in tongues and speak even the language of the angels, if we do not have love in life, we are just as sounding brass, a sound without the life. How different this is from a branch in the vine or a grain of wheat-they both quietly live by Christ.<p>It is by life that the building is realized. Let us take for example two local churches: in one church, the brothers seek to go on in the way of the grains and the branches. They live quietly, take Christ as their life, abide in Him, and allow Him to abide in them. In the other church the brothers take the way of gifts, speaking in tongues every day. After three years have passed, you will see a great difference between these two groups. The gift-centered group will either be dispersed or dissolved. But the group centered and living in Christ will continue to grow. We are not opposing the speaking in tongues, but we are much concerned lest we waste our time. We can never have a proper building of the church by teachings or by gifts. The only way is to live by the inner life. It may seem slow, but it is steady and it will hit the mark. The only way to obtain the goal of the proper church life is to go on steadfastly in the way of life.<h2 class=head1>THE MAJOR NEED TODAY</h2><p>We live today in an environment full of confusion and division. In such a situation the building up of the church desperately needs the mending ministry of life. Life which issues in building is the central message of the entire Scriptures. Firstly in Genesis 2 and lastly in Revelation 22, we see the tree of life. Oh, we must realize and practice this secret of life! By regeneration another source of life, Christ Himself as the Life-giving Spirit, has come to live in our spirit. Now we must learn to live in the spirit, living by Christ rather than by ourselves. As we thus abide in Him, we sense the need for the church life, and as we continue abiding, we will have the church life in a proper way. The spontaneous issue will be the real building up of the church. Then we will be the enlarged tabernacle, the corporate expression of Christ. Wherever we are located, we will be together with other Christians as the living and proper church, a real expression of Christ, a real glory to God, and a real blessing to those who are seeking the Lord.<p>In a certain sense we do need the teachings and occasionally we need the gifts. But the central requirement for the building up of the church today is the mending ministry of life. It is in this ministry that we experience Christ as our life and as the tabernacle, the dwelling of God. By this ministry we will have the enlarged tabernacle as the very expression of Christ. I am convinced that it is God&#8217;s intention to have such a building on this earth today. By taking Christ as our life we will all become a real, practical, living part of this greater tabernacle.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>GIFTS AND FUNCTIONS FOR THE BUILDING</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS LIFE IS FOR GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>The four Gospels, particularly John&#8217;s Gospel, reveal the purpose for which Christ came to this earth. He came that we might realize God&#8217;s building. We have seen many passages which show how Christ is related to God&#8217;s building. Christ&#8217;s entire work was for the purpose of being life to us that the tabernacle of God might be enlarged. The way for Christ to increase the tabernacle of God is for Him to impart Himself to us as life. Most Christians know that Christ came that we may have life abundantly, but very few realize the purpose for which He became our life. It is that we may have abundant life for God&#8217;s building. Christ&#8217;s impartation of life to us is not the goal, but the process. The goal is God&#8217;s building.<p>At the end of Scripture there is a city built up with Christ as the center. From Christ there flows the river of life, and in that flow of life there is the tree of life. This river and this tree minister life to all those of whom this city, God&#8217;s ultimate building, is composed. This picture clearly reveals that the purpose of Christ being life to us is that a city may be built up from this life and with this life. We must realize that even today the purpose of Christ being our life is the building of God.<p>When Christ was on the earth, He Himself was the tabernacle, God&#8217;s building. He was the dwelling-place for God to express Himself. But this tabernacle must be enlarged, and it is enlarged as we experience Christ as our life. As we enjoy Christ as our life, we are translated from Adam into Christ; we are transformed from Adam&#8217;s character and nature into Christ&#8217;s character and nature. Thus we become the enlarged tabernacle, the holy city, New Jerusalem. Christ came to be our life for the express purpose that He-the dwelling-place of God-could be enlarged. He is the one grain, out of which the many grains are produced. He is the one vine, out of which the many branches issue as the enlargement of the vine.<p>The Gospel of John presents Christ Himself as the tabernacle, whereas the book of Revelation unveils the holy city, New Jerusalem, as the tabernacle. These are not two tabernacles, but one tabernacle in two stages. The first stage is the individual Christ, whereas the last stage is Christ enlarged in millions of His believers. This is the corporate Christ. Thus we have covered the four Gospels and the ministry of the Apostle John.<h2 class=head1>ALL GIFTS AND FUNCTIONS ARE FOR GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>In the order of the New Testament, first Christ came to be life to us. Following Him, there are the apostles, the gifted persons, with certain kinds of ministries. Following them are all the Christians, who function and serve as the members of the Body. The consequence or issue of Christ as life is the gifted persons with their ministries, and, as a result of their ministries, there are the Christian members, who function and serve. Christ as life is for the building, the ministry of the gifted persons is for the building, and the functioning of all the members is also for the building. Everything is for the one purpose of the Body of Christ being produced, prepared, and built up.<p>Ephesians 2:20-22 says, &#8220;[We are] being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom ye [we] also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.&#8221; Ephesians 4:11-16 continues: &#8220;And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; but holding the reality in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ; out from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh growth of the body unto the building up of itself in love&#8221; (Gk.).<p>First Corinthians 14:12 says, &#8220;So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.&#8221; Here &#8220;edifying&#8221; means &#8220;building up.&#8221; Gifts are for the building up of the church. Romans 12:4-10 says: &#8220;For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same function: so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching; or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>ALL WORK IS FOR THE CHURCH-GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>All gifts and all gifted persons are for the building up of the Body; they are not for any work in itself. The practice of today&#8217;s Christianity is absolutely different in principle. Wherever there is a gifted person, a spiritual &#8220;giant&#8221; with a certain gift, that person will begin a work. He will build up a Christian organization or ministry, and possibly call it by some worthy name. We are not opposing anyone, but we are against the wrong principles which damage the Body life. The Apostle Paul did not form any Christian organization; he did not set up any kind of work. For possibly thirty years he just established local churches. And he did not keep any work in his own hands. In reading the New Testament we can only find the churches which were built up by him.<p>At the time the Apostle John wrote the book of Revelation he was greatly experienced and matured. Of the twelve Apostles, he was the only one remaining. Yet he did not build up anything as his work, his ministry. Consider the local churches in Asia to whom he wrote: most of them were exceedingly weak; yet those churches were the lampstands, not the ministry of the Apostle John. John&#8217;s ministry was far more spiritual than the condition of those churches; yet he did not set up his ministry as a lampstand. In fact, he did not set up his ministry as anything. All he did was to further the building up of those local churches as the lampstands. Oh, we all must learn this! We must be aware of the dangerous tendency for any local church to become a work, kept in the hands of some gifted person. If such is the case, that is a real degradation. However much the Lord may use a gifted person, however great his ministry may be, the local church must not become his work. God&#8217;s intention is not to build up the ministry of any person, but to build up His church. This is not a small matter.<p>In the New Testament there are the titles, the &#8220;church of God&#8221; (Acts 20:28), the &#8220;church of Christ&#8221; (Rom. 16:16), and the &#8220;church of the saints&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:33; 1 Thes. 1:1). There is never any &#8220;church of the apostles.&#8221; The church belongs to God, to Christ, and to the saints, not to any apostle.<p>The greater our gift is, the greater is the danger that we will take over the church and keep it in our hands. This will greatly damage the church life. We must learn not only how to minister in the local church, but also how to keep our hands off the church. This is not easy. The local church is not our personal enterprise. The local church is the property of the local saints, not some worker&#8217;s business. Some gifted persons put a local church in their pocket. They feel that this is the church they built, that this is their church. Oh, this is a real problem!<p>All the local saints must realize that the local church is their church. If the local saints are not clear concerning this, they will allow a gifted person to take the church into his own hands and treat it as his personal property. Then the entire church life will be finished. The local churches belong to the local saints. The gifted persons are just the means to perfect the saints to function; they are only the instruments used by the Lord to build up the churches.<p>Consider the situation in Christianity today. Look at the situation even from the time of the Reformation: four or five hundred years have passed, and it is still basically the same. Whenever a gifted person is raised up, a certain kind of work is established. I establish my work, you establish your work, and he establishes his work. Then the church is gone. This is the source of all the divisions. However, if one gifted brother comes to build a local church, and a second gifted brother comes to build up the same church, there will be no division. All the work must be for the church, not for the workers. The ministry should be for the church; the church should never be for the ministry. We must be exceedingly clear concerning this principle. We must drop all wrong practices. A gifted brother should keep his hands off the local church. Although a gifted brother may sometimes not speak openly in a way of ministry, yet he still may quietly maneuver behind the scenes. Any such maneuvering damages the church. All gifts and gifted persons must be entirely for the local church. This is a tremendously vital matter.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO BE A BUILDING MEMBER OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>We have seen both the ministry of the Lord Jesus and the ministry of the gifted persons. Now we come to the saints as the members.<h2 class=head2>By Growth in Life</h2><p>We all must realize that as members of the Body of Christ we must care for two things: first we need growth in life. This is basic. Without growth in life, the building of the Body is impossible. Today&#8217;s Christianity gives people the wrong impression. Most Christians feel that since they have a good pastor with several competent assistants, they need do nothing. But for a proper church life, every member must grow in life. First Peter 2:2, Ephesians 2:21, and Ephesians 4:15 are scriptures which indicate that the building up of the church is possible only by the growth of the members.<p>The church building is not a composition of so many bricks or dead stones; it is something living. If we do not grow, there is no possibility for the building of the church. We cannot merely use the term &#8220;church&#8221; and have a proper church. That does not work. Regardless of the name or the label, without the growth of life we are dead and empty. The proper church life depends on the proper growth of the members. We must first deal with our sins, our worldliness, and our self. We must experience the cross of Christ and know Christ as our life. We must live in the spirit, maintaining a constant living contact with Christ. Then we will have a certain amount of growth. It is by such growth that the building of the church exists, and it is in such a way that we will have the real New Testament church. The reality is in the life, not in the label! Growing up unto maturity is the first requirement of all the saints for the building of the church.<h2 class=head2>By Function in Life</h2><p>The second requirement of each member is that he must minister; he must function. You may say that you are not a minister. Nevertheless, we are all ministers. You certainly must admit that you are a member. If so, then consider your own body. Is there any member of your body which does not function? We must realize that we are members of the Body of Christ, and that as such we must learn how to function. If you say that you do not know how to function or that you cannot function, it is possibly due to the fact that you have not grown. The function of the members depends entirely on their growth in life. If a member is not able to function, that member is either unhealthy or underdeveloped. All the local saints must actively function in the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE MATERIALS FOR GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>Now we must carefully consider another important point. Let us read 1 Corinthians 3:9-15: &#8220;For we are God&#8217;s fellow-workers: ye are God&#8217;s husbandry, God&#8217;s building.  According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; each man&#8217;s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man&#8217;s work of what sort it is. If any man&#8217;s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. If any man&#8217;s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.&#8221;<p>When we function or serve in the church, we must always remember that there are two categories of materials: one consists of gold, silver, and precious stones; the other is composed of wood, hay, and stubble. We must be exceedingly careful not to function with materials from the second category. On one hand we must learn to function, but on the other hand we must learn to discern the materials we use in functioning. Gold speaks of the nature of God, silver of the redemptive work of Christ, and precious stones of the work of the Holy Spirit. These are the three items of the work of the three persons of the Godhead. We can only gain these three precious materials through the work of the cross. Thus we must function only by the cross and through the cross. Wood represents the human nature, and hay and stubble represent the things of this earth. We must learn to reject and deny all the human elements, all the things of this earth, by the cross. The Apostle Paul said that he was the wise masterbuilder who laid the foundation. But all the saints, including all the gifted persons, must be clear how to build. The ministry of gold, silver, and precious stones will be a real building up of the church. If, however, we bring in wood, hay, and stubble, we will greatly damage the church life. We must learn to check ourselves by the cross in the way we function. In the church we must always act by the way of the cross.<h2 class=head1>HINDRANCES TO THE BUILDING</h2><p>Today&#8217;s problem is not that there is a lack of individual, personal spirituality. The great problem today is the building up of the church. It is a corporate problem. An example of the way we can damage the church rather than build it up is in the way we conduct ourselves daily. If we live by Christ, such a life will save us from the dreaded practice of gossip. This life will even demand that we do not gossip. Oh, gossiping among the saints is a great damage to the church life! Whenever we begin to speak, we must exercise care that the words which proceed out of our mouth may build up the church. We may protest that we have never done anything to damage the church life; yet we may have killed people with our gossiping tongue. It is so easy for germs to be passed from one to another by way of the mouth. If you have experienced the real church life, you are already aware of how much the enemy utilizes the gossipers. Gossip damages the church life and spreads the element of death.<p>In practicing the church life we must also be careful never to criticize. Regardless of our intention, as long as we criticize we are damaging the church. There are many lessons for us to learn. If we would practice the church in the spirit, our spirit will constantly be on the alert. We will know what we must say and what we must do, and we will never do anything to damage anyone. The church life is a life of building; thus we must learn to live in the way of building up. We may say that we have learned the lessons of the cross. To learn the cross in great issues is easy, but most of the lessons of the cross are in the small matters. It is the cross experienced in the small matters day by day which teaches us the real lessons.<h2 class=head1>A SUMMARY</h2><p>There are many teachings concerning the building in the New Testament. Of these we must be exceedingly clear concerning three major points: first, Christ came that we may have life for the purpose of the building; second, all the gifts and all the gifted persons are for the building; and third, all the members with their functions and services are also for the building. God&#8217;s intention is to have a building. Throughout the world today it is easy to meet group after group of Christians who are loving and seeking the Lord, Christians who are seeking to be spiritual. It is very difficult, however, to find a group of believers who are growing up together as one building. Even in places which are well known for spirituality, you cannot perceive the building up. Instead, there is criticism and strife.<p>Today, among the Lord&#8217;s children, the most needful thing is the building. Oh, we have greatly neglected this matter! Because of this, we are weak, and the church is weak. Thus the tide of spiritual life in the church is very low. Let us forget ourselves, our personal spirituality, and our personal victory; let us just care for the building. Then we will indeed have wonderful victory. Pay full attention to the building; forget your personal problems; bring your problems to the Body, and the Body will swallow them up. Learn to care for the Body, and do not damage any member. Oh, this is a real lesson and a good test!<p>It is abundantly clear that God&#8217;s goal is not to have many spiritual persons, but to have a building. In every locality, each Christian must be built up with other saints in that locality. If others will not go along with you, that is their business-you cannot be responsible for that. But you must take the right standing and learn the proper lesson of being built up with others. You will experience victory over all things.<p>God&#8217;s ultimate goal is the New Jerusalem, but today, before that comes into full manifestation, God loves to have His saints in every locality built up as a miniature of the New Jerusalem, as a little expression of Christ. There are many lessons involved here. Yet, praise the Lord, God&#8217;s blessings are waiting for us. If we take the right standing, we will enjoy the blessings and have the victory. However, may we not be so stupid as to practice the church life and at the same time damage it by being careless. We may not have the intention to do so, yet damage is done by our carelessness. If we have a critical attitude or participate in gossiping, we spread the element of death and thus destroy the church life. May we learn all these lessons.<p>We have seen the stages of the building in the Old Testament. First there was a little tent with an altar; then came the tabernacle with the brass altar, and afterward the temple with a larger altar. Finally we saw the prospect in Ezekiel&#8217;s vision. Now we have seen the order in the New Testament: Christ came to be the tabernacle, and His intention was that the tabernacle be enlarged. It is for this purpose that He is life to us, and it is for this purpose He has given the church many gifted persons with gifts. Finally, all the members with their functions and services are for this one purpose. This is the meaning of the entire Scriptures. Eventually, in the fullness of time, the New Jerusalem will come as the ultimate manifestation of God&#8217;s building. Oh, if we have seen such a vision, we will be caught by it! Whatever we are, whatever we do, and wherever we go, we will be completely for this vision, for God&#8217;s building. We will take God&#8217;s goal as our goal.<p>There are many lessons to learn in this matter of building; yet, praise the Lord, we will also experience many blessings. May we be faithful to the Lord, and go on with Him in the fulfillment of His vision. If we are not faithful, the Lord will still go on; He will choose other persons for His recovery. May the Lord be merciful to us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REVELATION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM THROUGHOUT SCRIPTURE</h1><p>In this chapter we will share eight thoughts which are very basic to our understanding of the spiritual life and of the Scriptures.<h2 class=head1>A CORPORATE EXPRESSION AND REPRESENTATION</h2><p>First, the central thought of God&#8217;s intention as revealed in all of Scripture is to have a group of people who are built together by God and filled with Himself. Such a corporate body of people will express and represent God. The Old Testament clearly reveals how God called out the children of Israel and put them together as a corporate body. Then God dwelt among them to express Himself and to accomplish something through them. Old Testament history shows how, in a sense, the Israelites did eventually become the expression and representation of God on the earth. Likewise, in the New Testament era today, it is still God&#8217;s intention that every local church, wherever it is, must be built together as a corporate body and be filled with God that it may express and represent God. The end of the Scriptures clearly reveals that there will eventually be an enlarged corporate body called the New Jerusalem. This is an immense vessel composed of all those redeemed by God throughout all ages. This vessel will be filled with God, expressing and representing God throughout eternity. This is the first basic thought of the entire Bible.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S DWELLING-PLACE</h2><p>Secondly, both the Old and New Testaments reveal that all the redeemed people of God will eventually become God&#8217;s dwelling-place. During the period of the Old Testament the people of Israel were the dwelling-place of God. But strictly speaking, the material tabernacle and temples were not the real dwelling-places of God. They were only symbols of the fact that the people of Israel were God&#8217;s real dwelling-place. God dwelt among the Israelites (Exo. 29:45).<p>In the New Testament there are several passages which clearly reveal that the redeemed people of this age are the dwelling-place of God (Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Pet. 2:5). Then, at the end of the Scriptures, we see the redeemed of both ages composed together as God&#8217;s habitation. It is evident that the New Jerusalem is such a composition, for it has twelve gates containing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and twelve foundations containing the names of the twelve Apostles (Rev. 21:12, 14). These names represent all the saints of the Old and New Testament eras, and this corresponds with the thought of all Scripture that all the redeemed people of God will eventually become God&#8217;s dwelling.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S BRIDE</h2><p>Third, in the history of both the Old and New Testaments all the redeemed people of God are also God&#8217;s Bride, God&#8217;s counterpart. Books such as Isaiah (54:5; 62:5), Jeremiah (3:14; 31:32), Ezekiel (16:8; 23:5), and Hosea (2:19-20) reveal the people of Israel likened to God&#8217;s Bride. The New Testament then clearly portrays the church as the Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:23, 32). Finally, at the end of Scripture, all the redeemed are composed together as the one Bride of Christ. This means that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle, the dwelling-place of God, and also the Bride of Christ (Rev. 21:9). These thoughts are not new; they are found throughout the entire Scriptures. The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of all the thoughts of Scripture. It can be proven that nearly every part of the New Jerusalem is something which has already been mentioned in the Scriptures, either in Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Matthew, John, or other books.<h2 class=head1>THE TWELVE GATES</h2><p>The fourth thought concerns the twelve gates surrounding the holy city. There are three gates on each of the four sides of the city. This picture in Revelation 21 is not new; the book of Numbers (ch. 2) reveals a shadow of this thought, for there we see three camps on each of the four sides of the tabernacle. Remember, each gate of the New Jerusalem bears the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Yet the picture in Numbers is still not as clear as the one in Ezekiel 48. This chapter tells of a city called Jerusalem, whose gates exactly fit the description of the gates mentioned in Revelation 21. This is not just a coincidence. It is important to realize that these things are already mentioned previously in Scripture.<h2 class=head1>THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&#8217;S WORK</h2><p>The fifth thought involves the matter of dispensations. I do not like to use the term &#8220;dispensation,&#8221; because it has been spoiled by overuse. However, it is a good term, and we do have the reality of dispensations in the Scriptures. Some say that there are seven dispensations, beginning from the creation of man to the end of the millennium. They do not include the new heaven and new earth. However, according to the revelation of Scripture itself, it is better to say that there are only four dispensations. Basically, a dispensation does not mean a certain age or period of time, but the way in which God deals with people. However, when God deals with people in a certain way, it always occurs in a certain period of time.<p>Chapter 5 of Romans indicates that the first dispensation was from Adam to Moses (v. 14). This was the dispensation without law. During that time God did not deal with people according to law, but apart from the law. Then, from Moses to the arrival of John the Baptist or the first coming of Christ, was the dispensation of law. In this dispensation, God dealt with people according to His law, as clearly revealed in Romans 5. From the first coming of Christ to His second coming is the dispensation of grace and also the age of the church. During this period, God deals with us by grace and according to grace. Finally, the fourth dispensation is from the second coming of Christ to the end of the millennium, a period of one thousand years. This is the dispensation of the kingdom. Thus, there is the dispensation without the law, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom or of righteousness. These dispensations are closer to the literal rendering of Scripture than are the seven dispensations commonly referred to by many Christian teachers. The vital question is, What has God been doing and what has He been seeking to achieve in all these dispensations? We must see clearly that God has been engaged in a building work. Even up to the second coming of Christ, God&#8217;s building work will not have been thoroughly accomplished. The building will be completed, however, by the end of the millennium, when all four dispensations will have passed. That is when we will see the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven as the Bride adorned and prepared for her husband. God&#8217;s building work will then be fully accomplished. His building is not completed at the time of Revelation 20. It is not till chapter 21 that we see a new heaven and a new earth with the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s building. During the millennium, the holy city is still not fully completed, but at the end of the kingdom age it is fully consummated.<p>In simple words, the New Jerusalem is the composition of all the saints from every dispensation. The first dispensation includes Abel, Seth, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. The second dispensation includes Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Phinehas, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Malachi. The third dispensation includes Peter, James, John, Paul, and ourselves. And finally there will be some saints gathered from the time of the millennium. God has perfected a certain number of saints in each age, and He is still perfecting a large number of saints in this dispensation. Basically, He is preparing stones from all four dispensations. Even during the millennium He will perfect some. After that, all God&#8217;s redeemed ones will be brought together in one complete composition, the holy city.<h2 class=head1>THE ULTIMATE STATE OF THE NATIONS</h2><p>The sixth thought concerning the holy city involves something of prophecy. I do not like to speak much concerning prophecy, yet there are some vital points which apply here. In all four dispensations, God will have perfected some saints, while all unbelievers will undoubtedly perish. But at the end of the millennium, there will still be a number of unbelievers existing on this earth. What will the Lord do with them? Revelation 21 reveals that even on the new earth there are the nations (vv. 24-26). The unbelievers at the end of the millennium compose these nations. This point requires much explanation. After all of God&#8217;s dealings and judgments upon this earth, there will still be a number of nations remaining. Here we must note that the saints of whom the New Jerusalem is composed are kings and priests, kings to rule the nations and priests to serve God. The saints are those who feed on the fruits of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7; 22:14), and the nations exist and live by the healing of the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2). We cannot fully understand all these things now, but we will be clear in that day. We know that the tree of life symbolizes Christ, but what are the fruits and what are the leaves of this tree? We can only say that all the redeemed people in the new heaven and new earth will enjoy Christ as the fruit, and all the nations will live by the leaves of the tree of life.<h2 class=head1>GOD IS EVERYTHING IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>Our seventh thought concerns the matter of light in the New Jerusalem. The sun and the moon exist in the new heaven and new earth, but they are not needed in the holy city. We can illustrate this by pointing out that the moon does shine in the daytime, although it can barely be seen. However, it is not needed, for the sun is far brighter. Even so, we will not need the sun or the moon in the holy city, because God is there (Rev. 21:23; 22:5). The light of God is the brightest of all lights.<p>Nighttime will still exist in the new heaven and new earth. This means that day and night will continue. But because God is always brightly shining in the holy city, there is no need of the sun or the moon; so there will be no night there (Rev. 21:25).<p>These points reveal the basic principle that all natural things, such as food, water, clothing, sun and moon, are merely figures of what God is to us. All the redeemed ones enjoy God Himself; the unbelievers enjoy only the natural things. In the New Jerusalem we will have God as our sun, our light. We will not require any natural thing, for God will be everything to us. This also means that today, when we are redeemed and take God as our life, He is everything to us. We need nothing apart from God. This thought is quite deep. When we do not have God in Christ, we need many other things; but if we have God in Christ, we need nothing more. May this become clear to us.<h2 class=head1>THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>Our eighth and final thought concerns the inhabitants of the holy city. We are not clearly told who the inhabitants are. Logically, we could say that God must be the inhabitant, since the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God. However, look again at John 1:14. The Word, who was God, was made flesh to tabernacle among us. This means that the tabernacle itself dwelt among us. But who was the dweller of the tabernacle mentioned in the Gospel of John? We know that Jesus was that tabernacle and that Jesus was the mingling of God with man. Hence, the dwellers of that tabernacle were God and man. That tabernacle was composed of the dwellers, and there were no dwellers in that tabernacle except those who composed it-God and man. The same principle is found in Revelation 21. In eternity, those composing the New Jerusalem will be the very dwellers of that city. God will be the dweller, and the redeemed ones will be dwellers as well. All the redeemed with God Himself are the very elements of which the New Jerusalem is composed. Thus, the dwellers are the city itself.<p>Here then is a very practical question: Of what is the church composed? The church, as we have seen, is the house of God, the mingling of God and man. But who are the dwellers within this house? It is clear: they are the very components of the house. Apart from the house itself, there are no dwellers. The dwellers are the house, and the house itself is the composition of the dwellers. Praise the Lord!<p>So many are not clear concerning the matter of the church. They conceive of the church as a material building in which the saints gather. They imagine the saints coming into the house as the dwellers. Likewise, many consider the New Jerusalem as something other than the saints. They believe it to be a heavenly mansion with some of the saints put into it as the dwellers. This seems quite logical; however, when we study the Scriptures deeply, we discover that the New Jerusalem is just like the church today. It is all the saints composed together as the city. We must be clear that the dwellers composed together are the very dwelling-place. The dwellers dwell within themselves. We are the church, yet we dwell in the church. This means that we dwell in ourselves. This is all very subjective. God works upon us because we are the dwelling-place. If we are just the inhabitants within the dwelling, there would be no need for God to build us up. We could simply wait for the building to be completed and then enter into it to dwell there. However, the dwellers constitute the dwelling-place. Thus, all Christians must be built up together wherever they are. We cannot get away from the building. If we would share in the church life, we must be built up in it. You cannot say, &#8220;I will wait until the building is accomplished; then I will go to dwell in it.&#8221; No! You can only be built into the dwelling. If you are not willing to be built into it, you will never be in it. The dweller is the very component of the building. This matter is exceedingly deep. Some even say that it is a heresy to speak of the New Jerusalem as a living composition of all the saints and not to consider it as the heavenly mansion. One day we will all be clear. Unless we are built into the New Jerusalem, we will have no share in it. This is not a matter of prophecy, but of experience. Until we are built into the church, we can never have a practical share in the church life.<p>Christianity today is so shallow! Whoever you are, you may just come and be a member of the &#8220;church.&#8221; In one sense, that is correct. But in actuality, until we are built into the church, we can never have the reality of the church life.<p>Some Christians are told that just as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, someday they will go to the New Jerusalem. In a sense, that is also correct, because we may all share in the New Jerusalem by the redemption of Christ. Yet, there is still another aspect. We must be built into that city. The Apostle Peter was built into it, for the name of one of the precious foundation stones is Peter (Rev. 21:14). There is a principle here which is quite easily misunderstood. Some may ask, &#8220;Are you saying that the redemption of Christ is not sufficient? Do we need something in addition to the redemption of Christ?&#8221; One day we will all be there, and then we will be very clear. But that day may be too late as far as you are concerned. After redemption, we need the work of transformation (Rom. 12:2) and building (Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5).<p>Let us consider a typical case of a new convert. Last week he was an unbeliever; but a few days ago he believed, and yesterday he was baptized. On one hand, as long as he has believed in the Lord Jesus, he has become a member of the church. But, until the day that he is practically built into the church, he will not share the church life in experience. Beginning from the time of his regeneration, he must be transformed and built together with all the saints. Then he will have a practical share in the church life.<p>Why has the New Jerusalem not yet come? The Lord Jesus has ascended into heaven and has been there for nearly two thousand years; yet the New Jerusalem has not yet appeared. The question is, How many redeemed ones have been transformed and built into this holy city? Do we realize that in this city everything is composed of gold, pearl and precious stones? There is no clay there. Perhaps you have been saved for ten years, but have you been fully transformed yet from a piece of clay to a precious stone? Are we really fit for the New Jerusalem? Frankly speaking, even if the Lord should put us there, we would have to say, &#8220;No, no; we do not fit here.&#8221; Do you see now that there is more required than just the work of redemption? There must also be the work of transformation and building. Today&#8217;s church must have the work of transformation and building. The Apostle Paul clearly tells us that we must be careful to build up the building of God with gold, silver and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Immediately after we are saved, we are not pure gold, pearl, silver, or precious stones. We are like an uncut diamond-just so much rock. How much transformation and building up we need! The situation today is very poor. It is too objective. People say, &#8220;Our church is wonderful. Come and join us.&#8221; No! All the dwellers of the church are the components of the church. You must be built into the church; otherwise, you can never be in the church in a practical way.<p>All of these eight thoughts are indeed deep, yet they are very basic. The main point is that we all must be worked upon, transformed, and built up together; then there will be the new city. All the dwellers of the New Jerusalem are the very components of which the city is built.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><p>There are more than forty major points as aspects of the church life which we can learn from the vision of the New Jerusalem recorded at the end of Revelation.<h2 class=head1>1) THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p>The first point is that this city is the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s building work from the beginning of creation throughout all generations. The first thing which the Apostle John saw in his vision was a new heaven and a new earth (Rev. 21:1). Following that, he saw the New Jerusalem descend out of heaven. Heaven and earth represent God&#8217;s work of creation, but the New Jerusalem represents God&#8217;s work of building. This means that following His initial work of creation, God has continued to work through many generations to achieve His ultimate building. Genesis 1 and 2 record God&#8217;s creation work, but from Genesis 3 to the end of the Scriptures God is continually working for His building. Let us recall the vital meaning of God&#8217;s building: it is that God is building Himself into man and building man into Himself. It is the very mingling of God and man. Throughout all generations God has been working along this line for this purpose. The Scriptures mainly reveal that God&#8217;s whole work since creation has been to mingle Himself and man together as one.<p>When the Word of God, God Himself, became incarnated as a man, this was an expression of the living tabernacle, a real mingling of God with man. Before this time, as we have seen, God was God and man was man. But at the time of incarnation and since that time, something has happened on this earth: God has mingled Himself with man. Most Christians are familiar with Isaiah 9:6, yet few have been impressed that a child was born on this earth whose name was called the Mighty God. If this were not recorded in Scripture, no one would believe that a child could be called the Mighty God. This child was both the tabernacle and the temple, the very building of God (John 1:14; 2:19). Divinity had been mingled with humanity-this is the real definition of God&#8217;s building.<p>From the time of God&#8217;s incarnation as man, especially during a period of thirty-three and a half years, there was a man on this earth with God in Him. Jesus was a real man, a typical man, yet the Mighty God was wrought into Him. God had come to be a man, and God was brought into man. However, that is not all: the Lord Jesus also brought man into God. He accomplished this by His death and resurrection. Today in the heavens there is a man in God. By Christ&#8217;s incarnation, God was brought into man; and by His death, resurrection and ascension, man has been brought into God.<p>While Jesus was on this earth, He was a man with God in Him; today, while Jesus is in heaven, He is the very God with man in Him. This is the mingling of God with man and man with God, and this is the meaning of God&#8217;s building. This mingling has already been accomplished. Now all we need is a mass reproduction of this mingling. We all need, experientially, to have Christ incarnated into us. Then He must bring us through death and resurrection into God. The more we pass through the cross and into the resurrection, the more we will be in God. God is in us today, but we are not very much in God. This is why God is doing His work of building on this earth today.<p>Today, when we preach the gospel, we do the work of incarnation; we bring God into man. Then we immediately begin the work of edification-that is, we bring people into God by the cross and the resurrection of Christ. In this way we all become the mass production of Christ. When this reproduction work is fully completed and composed together, the result is the enlarged tabernacle, the New Jerusalem.<p>The Bible is a composition of sixty-six books which tell us how God has been working for over six thousand years to bring His ultimate building into existence. Bible students speak of many dispensations, telling how God works in one age in a certain way and in another age in another way. Yet the ultimate result, the issue of all God&#8217;s work throughout all generations, will be the New Jerusalem. However we may interpret the dispensations, we must realize that all of God&#8217;s various ways of working will issue in a certain kind of result-the New Jerusalem. It is indeed logical that a picture of such a building is at the end of the sixty-six books of Scripture.<p>We have seen from Scripture how in the early stages of history there was a little tent with a little altar. Through many generations that tent has increased until ultimately there is a large tabernacle. How significant that the New Jerusalem is still called the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3). This tabernacle is the total mingling of God with man.<h2 class=head1>2) THE CITY REPRESENTING THE KINGDOM</h2><p>Our second major point is that this ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s work is not only a tent, a tabernacle, but also a city. A tent is not very strong or permanent; but this tent is also a city. According to the scriptural meaning, a city is a center for the exercise of authority. Therefore, the city symbolizes the kingdom. The New Jerusalem is not only a tent as a dwelling-place; it is also a city as the center of a kingdom. In the early stages of history there was a small tent; then came the tabernacle and eventually the temple; finally there will be a city, the strongest and most established structure of all.<p>It is difficult to visualize authority as symbolized by a tent, a tabernacle, or even a temple. But a city aptly symbolizes a center where authority is exercised. It is the symbol of the kingdom. The throne of God will be displayed in the New Jerusalem, for this city is the center of God&#8217;s authority. The early chapters of the book of Revelation reveal God sitting on the throne apart from the city (Rev. 4:2-3). But in the concluding chapters God is on the throne in the city (Rev. 21:5; 22:3). This signifies that it is not until the New Jerusalem descends out of heaven at the end time that God will be enthroned in a city. He is on the throne now, but at that time He will exercise His authority over a full kingdom.<p>The church today must be the realm of God&#8217;s kingdom. The Apostle Paul speaks of this vital principle in his writings. Romans 12 reveals the Body of Christ, but Romans 14 speaks of the kingdom. The proper church life is a realm, a sphere, where God may exercise His authority. Strictly speaking, the proper church life is the kingdom of God. The church life must be like the holy city, the New Jerusalem, a center where God may exercise His authority.<h2 class=head1>3) THE CITY BUILT IN ORDER</h2><p>Our third major point is that the New Jerusalem is a city built up in perfect order. It is not just a heap of precious stones, but a city built up with precious stones (Rev. 21:10-11). We may possess many good materials which are ideal for building; however, if these materials are merely gathered in a pile, they certainly do not compose a building. Even so, in the church life there must be the real building, not just a group of wonderful believers gathered together. Our first need is to be transformed into precious material; then we must be built up with others as a building. When we have the real building, the city will be manifested in order. In the church life we must all be in a good order, not just heaped together as a pile of materials. If I were to invite someone to my house, I would not take him to a lumberyard. I must bring him to a house which has been built up in good and proper order. To be a proper church, we first need to be a building, and then we will be a city.<h2 class=head1>4) THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>The fourth major point is that the New Jerusalem is the very tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3). The tabernacle conveys three basic thoughts: that of dwelling, of rest, and of expression. The church must be such a tabernacle. It must be a place where God dwells, where God rests, and where God expresses Himself.<h2 class=head1>5) THE BRIDE</h2><p>The fifth point is that this city is also called the Bride (Rev. 21:9-10). A bride portrays several main things. The first bride, Eve, was a part of her husband. She came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-24); therefore, she was his counterpart. Even so, the church must be a part of Christ (Eph. 5:30-32). A bride also speaks of love and unity. The husband loves the bride, and the bride loves her husband. She is united in oneness with her husband. Such unity is not only a matter of love, but also a matter of life. Adam did not find his counterpart in any of the other living creatures, for none possessed a life which matched his own. Only Eve had the same life that Adam had. The church must firstly be something which is taken out of Christ; then it must be in a union of love with Christ; finally, it must possess the same life and nature as Christ.<p>To be a bride is easy. But the bride must also be a wife. Everything is wonderful on the wedding day, but afterwards the bride must become the wife, and that is more serious. The New Jerusalem is not only the Bride, but also the Wife of Christ for all eternity.<h2 class=head1>6) THE CENTER OF GOD&#8217;S AUTHORITY</h2><p>Next we see that in this city there is a center, the throne of God. It is the throne of God in Christ (Rev. 22:3). God is in Christ, for Christ is portrayed as the lamp containing God as the light (Rev. 21:23). The city of the New Jerusalem is like a lampstand, holding Christ as the lamp with God as the light. Thus, since God is in Christ on the throne, there is only one throne. God in Christ and with Christ sits on the throne in the city, and this throne is the center of the city.<p>In the church life today there must also be a center. That center is the throne of God, from which God in Christ exercises His authority in the church. The entire church must be under the authority of God in Christ. Here we see the matter of headship. Christ with God is the Head. In the church we must always be careful never to exercise our authority. We must all learn to give place to God, the real authority in the church. We must learn to subject ourselves to the headship of God in Christ.<h2 class=head1>7) THE LIGHT</h2><p>The seventh major point is that the headship of God in Christ is the very light. Wherever God is in authority, there is also light. On the other hand, wherever there is confusion, there is darkness. When God&#8217;s authority is exercised in a local church, that church will be full of the divine light. If God is not on the throne, if He is not in authority, He cannot shine, and there will be no light. If we all give place to God in Christ that He may exercise His authority, if we all are willing to subject ourselves to Him, everything in our midst will be full of light. Even in our personal lives, when we admit the headship of Christ and subject ourselves to Him, He brings us into light. Rebellion puts us into darkness, but subjection brings us into the light.<h2 class=head1>8) THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p>The eighth point is that this city is one large, universal lampstand. In the opening chapters of Revelation there are seven lampstands in seven localities. But at the end of this book, there is one immense lampstand in the entire universe. The New Jerusalem is a city of gold, as a mountain rising up (Rev. 21:18). On the top of this mountain city is the throne of God. God on His throne is the light in the Lamb, who is the lamp (Rev. 21:23). Hence, the entire city is a golden lampstand.<p>The local church must be such a lampstand. When God in Christ is on the throne in a local church, when He is exercising His authority and shining, that church becomes a lampstand. In eternity there will be only one universal church, but today there are many local churches. Therefore, we see seven lampstands in Revelation, depicting the church in history, in time. In eternity we will see only one large lampstand, the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>9) THE FLOW OF LIFE</h2><p>The ninth point is that from the throne there issues the flow of the water of life (Rev. 22:1). If anything flows out of God, it must be something of God Himself; hence, this flow is God Himself, flowing out as life. In the church, when God is allowed to exercise His headship in Christ and thus shine as the light, He spontaneously flows out to us as life. Whenever anyone enters into such a church life, he immediately senses this flow of life. There is a sense of being watered rather than any sense of dryness. Such a flow of life depends upon the throne being set up in the church. God&#8217;s authority must be exercised that the light of God may shine and that the life may flow.<h2 class=head1>10) THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>The tenth point is that in this flow there is the tree of life bearing rich fruits (Rev. 22:2). This tree is the life supply, the food for life. In the church, whenever there is the flow of life, the complete supply of God as our spiritual food will come to us in that flow. Whenever we attend a meeting, whether it is a prayer meeting, a meeting for the Lord&#8217;s table, or a fellowship meeting, we will partake of some fruit of the tree of life. In every meeting there will be something upon which we may feed.<h2 class=head1>11) THE ONE STREET</h2><p>The eleventh point is that with this flow and supply of life there is a street. There is only one street, only one way. In the street of the New Jerusalem there is a river flowing, and in that river there grows a tree whose branches reach to both sides of the river. The spiritual way is always with the flow and the supply of life. Let us check our own experience: if we do not have the flow of life and the supply of life, there is no way; we do not know how to go on. When a meeting of the church is full of the life supply in the flow of life with the light and authority of God, we will be so clear concerning the way. After such a meeting and even during that meeting, we will say, &#8220;Now I am clear; I know what I must do with this or with that; I know how to go on.&#8221; It is clear because there is the way, the street. If, however, the meeting of the church is full of confusion and darkness, poverty and dryness, it is a meeting which has no throne, no light, and no flow of life. In such a meeting we will be in darkness, and afterward we will not know how to go on. There is no way.<p>The above picture reveals three things in one: the street or the way, the flow of life, and the tree of life. When we have the flow of life, we also have the tree of life and the way of life. The way of life is with the tree of life, and the tree of life grows in the flow of life. In the flow there is the life supply and the way to go on.<h2 class=head1>12) ONE FLOW, ONE TREE, ONE STREET</h2><p>Our twelfth point is that there is only one flow of life, one tree of life, and one street of life. If your way is different from my way, something is wrong! Either you are wrong or I am wrong, or possibly both of us are wrong. If nothing is wrong, then we must be in the same way, for there is only one way. Cities today have so many streets and so many ways; thus it is easy to be lost. But there is no such problem in the New Jerusalem: that city has only one street and one way.<p>The picture of the New Jerusalem also reveals that the street must be laid out in a spiral pattern. The city itself is shaped like a mountain with the throne of God at the peak. From the foundation of the city, the street passes all twelve gates through which the people enter. Then it winds spirally upward around the city until it reaches the throne. From the throne, the river of life flows downward in the midst of the street until it reaches all twelve gates of the city. Regardless through which gate you enter, if you go on in the one street you will eventually hit the throne. The street ascends upward, but the flow of life is downward. The life of God flows to us to bring us upward. Whenever we have the flow within us, it will always bring us the way; and when we follow the way, the street will bring us to the throne of God. The enjoyment of the flow of life imparts the way of life, and the way of life brings us to God. If we just follow the way of life, we will be brought into the presence of God. In the church life today there is only one flow of life, one tree of life, and one way of life. The way of life is always upward. The more we follow this way, the more we will go onward and upward to the throne.<h2 class=head1>13) THE GOLDEN STREET</h2><p>Our thirteenth point is that this one street is all of gold (Rev. 21:21). This signifies that the way of life is in the nature of God. The spiritual way must always be the way of life with God&#8217;s nature. Whenever you feel that you must do something in a certain way, that way must contain the nature of God. If you would do anything in a way which is contrary to God&#8217;s nature, then that is not the right way. The right way is the way of the golden street, the way of the nature of God. When you are in the flow of life, you have the way, and this way always has the nature of God.<p>These vital points as seen in the New Jerusalem have helped me greatly to realize all the aspects of the church life, for this city is the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s building.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM (Continued)</h1><p>We cannot exhaust the record of the New Jerusalem; it is exceedingly meaningful. At least to some extent we must experience these points which we are covering; otherwise, it is rather difficult to understand them. The degree to which we experience these things will be the degree of our understanding of them. In the last chapter we have covered thirteen points concerning the real meaning of the ultimate manifestation of God. In this chapter we will continue by covering fifteen additional points, beginning with the fourteenth.<h2 class=head1>14) THE GATES OF THE CITY</h2><p>In the city there are three gates on each of its four sides, covering every direction: north, south, east, and west (Rev. 21:12-13). The number four always represents creation or the creature. Revelation 4 reveals four living creatures, which represent all creation. The number three signifies the three persons of the Godhead. This means that the three persons of the Godhead are the very entrance for all people from all four directions of the earth. Wherever we are, the three persons of the Godhead can reach us.<p>Luke 15 records three parables: the shepherd seeking the lost sheep, the woman seeking the lost coin, and the father waiting for his prodigal son. The Lord Jesus came as the shepherd to die on the cross to seek us and to redeem us. After Christ&#8217;s work, the Holy Spirit came as the woman to enlighten us, seeking within our hearts to bring us back. By the seeking work of the Holy Spirit, we repent and return to the Father, who gladly receives us. Then we have entered the gate. The three persons of the Godhead bring us into the very building. They are the entrance to anyone from the four corners of the earth. This corresponds with that which is spoken in 2 Corinthians 13:14 for entering into the enjoyment of the Triune God: the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the communion of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>15) THE PEARLS OF REGENERATION</h2><p>Our fifteenth point is that each of these twelve gates is one pearl (Rev. 21:21). A pearl here signifies the work of regeneration. When we enter the realm of God&#8217;s building through the three persons of the Godhead, we are regenerated. A pearl is formed in an oyster, a living organism abiding in the water, which represents death. When the oyster is hurt by a grain of sand, which remains in the wounded area, it secretes the fluid of life upon this grain of sand until it is transformed into a beautiful pearl. This is full of meaning. Christ is the living &#8220;oyster,&#8221; who came into the water of death. He was hurt by us as pieces of sand, and we as the grains of sand have remained at the place of the wound. Thus His life was secreted into us and we were regenerated. Regeneration is the beginning of the work of transformation.<p>Some Christians are deeply in the process of transformation day by day, but with others the process stopped at regeneration. With some the work of transformation is taking place now, but by this evening or at least by tomorrow it will be frustrated. We are so peculiar and evil. There is a very rebellious nature within each one of us. Sometimes we would even tell the Lord that we want to give it all up, we do not care whether we are transformed. Yet five minutes later we ask the Lord to forgive us. We cannot escape! We must come back; we will not have any peace if we do not. Oh, there are many things involved in this work of transformation! The pearl gate of regeneration is just the beginning, the very entrance into the city. Once we are in the realm of God&#8217;s building, we must go on in the transformation work of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>16) EXPERIENCING THE DIVINE NATURE</h2><p>Our sixteenth point is that once we go through the pearl gate, we immediately step onto the golden street in the city (Rev. 21:21). What is the meaning of this golden street? According to experience, when we pay attention to regeneration, the first stage of the Lord&#8217;s transformation work, we sense that we are contacting the divine nature of God, we are on the golden street. We must realize the work of regeneration in our experience and day by day experience the hurt of the oyster, the work of the cross in us. Then we will obtain the secretion from the oyster, the resurrection life in the Spirit. We constantly need the secretion of the divine life in the Holy Spirit within us. The more we experience the cross, the more we will realize the resurrection, the secretion of life. This is why we must daily experience the lessons of the cross, abiding in the wound of the Lord Jesus. By the secretion of the resurrection life, we will experience a continuing on in the golden street, the divine nature. This street will bring us into the very presence of God. In the midst of this street we will experience the flow of life, and in this flow we will enjoy the supply of life, the spiritual food. All these things are related and should be experienced by us.<h2 class=head1>17) THE ONE INNER FLOW OF LIFE</h2><p>Our seventeenth point is that regardless from which direction we approach the city, regardless of which gate we use, we will be on just one street (Rev. 22:2) along with everyone else. Remember that the New Jerusalem is shaped like a mountain, with the base of the city, a square. This &#8220;mountain&#8221; has three dimensions, all of equal measure: it is twelve thousand stadia in width, length, and height. The city&#8217;s one street winds downward in a spiral fashion from the top to the base. It begins at the throne at the top, and the last spiral of the street passes the twelve gates at the base. So regardless from which side or by which gate you enter, you will be on the same street with all the others. We are not divided. We are all in one way, one flow. How significant! It is not just the same street, it is the one street. In a city there may be two streets which are quite alike, but this street is the one street, which means that there is only one flow.<p>How wonderful it would be if all Christians cared only for the inner flow! Suppose that I am a Christian of Chinese origin visiting Christians in Japan. The Chinese people differ greatly from the Japanese; yet when we forget all the outward things and simply care for the inner feeling, the inner flow, the result is indeed wonderful. There is the same taste, the same feeling, the same sense-everything is the same. This principle also applies, of course, to Christians from Europe and America. The problem is that although the inward flow is one and we are all in that one flow, we care for too many outward things.<p>Suppose that a group of Christians are together and having wonderful fellowship. They are all in the one flow of life. But then one Christian in conversation asks another, &#8220;To which church do you belong?&#8221; The other may reply that he is a Methodist, and the first may exclaim, stiffening a bit, that he is a Baptist. Most of us have had this kind of experience. When we fellowship together about Christ, there is a wonderful flow; but when we talk about the denominations, everyone&#8217;s face becomes long. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, we will all be in the same flow, in the one street, and we will all partake of the same food. I hope that it will not be too late for some.<h2 class=head1>18) THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2><p>Our eighteenth point is that in this city there is real fellowship. This fellowship begins from the throne and reaches all the gates. It is in the flow (the river) of life, with the supply (the tree) of life, and the way (the street) of life (Rev. 22:1-2). However, this fellowship is not just among ourselves; it is also a fellowship between us and God. It is not only horizontal; it is also vertical. When we are in the flow of life, enjoying the supply of life and walking in the way of life, spontaneously we have fellowship one with another. We have proper and genuine fellowship with all the saints and with God on the throne. If you check your experiences, you will find this to be true. We will see more later concerning this flow, this fellowship.<h2 class=head1>19) THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>We have seen that the fellowship is in the flow of life. Now we must see that it is also related to the throne (Rev. 22:1). The throne represents authority, and the proper fellowship in life is always related to the authority of the throne. In other words, the authority is related to the kingship, and the fellowship is related to the priesthood. All the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem are both kings and priests. There must be these two aspects in God&#8217;s building. We need the kingship or the authority, and we also need the priesthood or the fellowship.<p>The Old Testament clearly illustrates this principle in every phase of God&#8217;s building. Moses represented the kingship in the building of the tabernacle, and Aaron, the high priest, represented the priesthood. All these had fellowship together. The tabernacle was built up by the authority and by the fellowship. King Solomon represented the authority in the building of the first temple, and the high priest was there, representing the priesthood, the fellowship. Following the seventy years of captivity, in the recovery of the building, there was Zerubbabel, the governor, and Joshua, the high priest. Chapter six of Zechariah portrays Christ as the builder of God&#8217;s temple. Upon His shoulders are the two offices of the kingship and the priesthood. As the king He possesses the authority, and as the priest He has the fellowship.<p>The building of the church is accomplished only by these two offices-the authority and the fellowship, the kingship and the priesthood. If the church is to be built, there must be authority and order. Each of us must subject ourselves to the Headship, the Lordship, the Kingship of Christ. This will deliver us from all kinds of confusion. Christianity today is full of confusion, but there can never be any confusion in the building of the church. Just a little confusion will tear down the building. Any building contractor will tell you that proper order must be maintained during construction. Confusion only damages the building process. In the church the authority of the headship must be exercised among all the members that we may have order without any confusion.<p>However, the kingship requires the balance of the priesthood. What is the priesthood? It is all of us ministering to the Lord together as priests. We must pray much together. I do not believe any church can be built up by ministry alone. We must pray together as priests, ministering to the Lord, having fellowship one with another. In this way we will experience the kingship and the priesthood. Vertically, there will be the order and authority, and horizontally, there will be the fellowship. In this way the church building will be realized. We need more fellowship under the headship; then we will have the order and the flow. Spontaneously, all the materials will be put together and the reality of the building will be realized and accomplished.<h2 class=head1>20) THE WALL IN GOD&#8217;S LIKENESS</h2><p>Our twentieth point concerns the wall which surrounds the city. The wall&#8217;s appearance is jasper (Rev. 21:18), the same as the description of God&#8217;s appearance in Revelation 4:3. This means that the wall of the city expresses God&#8217;s likeness, God&#8217;s appearance.<h2 class=head1>21) THE SEPARATION AND PROTECTION OF THE WALL</h2><p>The twenty-first point relates to the purpose of this wall. Its function is to separate that which is holy from that which is common, to separate that which belongs to God from that which does not belong to God. Such a separating wall is also a protection. The wall of any house is a separating factor, separating that which is within from that which is without, and such a separation protects all within the house. The wall of the holy city is a real separation: everything within this wall is holy, and everything without is common. This wall also affords full protection to all within the city.<p>God&#8217;s very appearance is the separating factor of this wall. The more a local church is in the likeness of God, the more it is separated from the world and everything common. How do we acquire God&#8217;s likeness? We can acquire God&#8217;s likeness only by God&#8217;s life. If the life of God flows within us, we will be in His very likeness, and His likeness will be the separating power of the church. Why is Christianity so similar to the worldly communities of today? Because there is practically nothing about most of those in Christianity in the appearance of God. Most Christians lack God&#8217;s likeness without because they lack the flow of His life within. Oh, God&#8217;s life must flow within us that we may bear His likeness without! This will cause the church to be separated from the common and worldly things, and at the same time this will protect us from so many injurious influences.<h2 class=head1>22) THE BUILDING OF THE WALL</h2><p>Next, this separating wall, as the protection to the city, needs to be built up. This does not happen overnight, for this wall is built of precious stones. The real building of the church is in this matter of separation. The city, which is all of gold, signifies the divine nature, and this nature does not involve much building. All the gates of the city are pearls, which do indicate some amount of building. The wall, however, is the main part of the building of the city. As we have seen, this wall as the separating and protecting factor, is in the likeness of God. It is one hundred forty-four cubits high, that is, twelve times twelve, which signifies completion in completion. The wall is indeed high. Some people accuse us of having such a high wall and giving the appearance of being sectarian; yet we must have such a high wall. Most of the time our wall is not high enough. We must have a wall one hundred and forty-four cubits high to keep out everything common, and this wall must be built with precious stones.<p>It is quite easy to find mud to produce clay bricks, but it is extremely difficult to find precious stones. We may easily produce a large quantity of clay bricks overnight, but in one month&#8217;s time we can hardly acquire one piece of precious stone. Precious stones require much transformation work. It is easy to build a clay structure, but the work of transformation is exceedingly slow. We must be transformed into the likeness of God. Remember, God is in the appearance of jasper. Today, we are pieces of clay; hence, we must be transformed into pieces of jasper and then built up to a height of one hundred forty-four cubits.<h2 class=head1>23) THE MEASUREMENT OF THE WALL</h2><p>The twenty-third point is that the measurement of the wall is &#8220;according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel&#8221; (Rev. 21:17). This signifies that it is in the situation of man being like an angel. Luke 20:35-36 reveals that it is in resurrection that man will be the same as the angels. Therefore, the building of the wall is in resurrection. It is not of the natural life.<p>In summary, we have seen several features of the wall: a) It has the appearance and likeness of God, b) it is a separating factor, c) it affords protection, d) it is built exceedingly high, e) its stones are material which has been transformed, and f) it is something in resurrection. Oh, this city is so rich in all points! It reveals all the aspects of the building of the church. There is no other portion in the Scriptures which is so rich concerning the church life.<h2 class=head1>24) THE CITY&#8217;S DIMENSIONS</h2><p>Our twenty-fourth point is that this city has three equal dimensions (Rev. 21:16). In the entire Bible the only other structure that is equal in all three dimensions is the holiest of all. Whether in the tabernacle or in the temple, the holiest of all was always in three equal dimensions. In the tabernacle it was ten by ten by ten cubits, and in the temple it was twenty by twenty by twenty cubits (1 Kings 6:20). The entire city of the New Jerusalem is in three equal dimensions. This proves that the whole city is the holiest of all.<p>Holiness is the nature of God. Love reveals God&#8217;s heart, righteousness is God&#8217;s way, and holiness is God&#8217;s nature. Only God Himself is holy, for only God is separated and uniquely different from everything else. The New Jerusalem is a city which is absolutely saturated and mingled with God; therefore it is absolutely holy. It is entirely different from all other things. Whenever we experience the mingling of God with us today, there is a real separation, a real holiness. In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that very thing. Holiness signifies a separation from common things. The more you are mingled with God in Christ, the more you will be holy. You will be different and separated from all things common. To be holy means to have something of God mingled with us. Holiness is not a matter of action, but a matter of nature, for holiness is God&#8217;s nature. It is not what we do, but how much we have been mingled with God. An aloofness from everything is not holiness. Holiness is determined by how much we have experienced being mingled with God. Chapter 12 of Hebrews says that God chastens us that we might be partakers of His holiness (v. 10). That means that He chastens us that we may partake of His nature by being mingled with Him. The New Jerusalem is absolutely and thoroughly mingled with God; therefore it is the holy city.<h2 class=head1>25) THE &#8220;NEW JERUSALEM&#8221;</h2><p>Our twenty-fifth point concerns the name of this city. Why is it called the &#8220;New Jerusalem&#8221; (Rev. 21:2)? What is the newness? Again, it is God Himself, for only God is new. In the church life we need both holiness and newness. The church life must not be common, and the church life must not be old. When we attend some Christian meetings, our only impression is a sense of oldness. Ephesians 5 says that the church must be without spot or wrinkle. A spot speaks of something which has been damaged, whereas wrinkles are the sign of oldness. The church must be without spot, without any wound or damage from the enemy, and the church must be without wrinkles due to oldness. We should never say that we are an old church. No! The church must be very new, without a trace of oldness. Every day the church must be new. If we experience Christ day by day, we can maintain this newness. On the other hand, if we do not grow daily in our experiences of Christ, we will perpetuate something old. Our experience may have been new last year, but it is much too old to apply this year. We must grow in Christ to have the newness. The church is the one new man; it will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.<p>We may tell how much a local church has grown by observing one factor: if the situation and atmosphere of the meeting is the same this year as it was last year, then there is oldness; there has been no growth. On the other hand, if the church is continually growing, the meetings will be continually new. In the holy city the tree of life brings forth a new kind of fruit every month (Rev. 22:2). Christ is so rich-we can never exhaust Him! We must have some new experiences of Christ every day to keep ourselves in newness. This newness and freshness are a proof that the church is growing.<h2 class=head1>26) GOD AS LIGHT</h2><p>Our twenty-sixth point is that in this city there is no need of any man-made light or even of any natural light such as the sun (Rev. 21:23; 22:5). In the church life we do not need either of these, for we have God in Christ as our light. Natural light signifies our natural sight or insight. Many times in the meetings of the church some brothers and sisters bring in their natural insight. And sometimes in the meetings people bring in light manufactured by human hands. In the church life both natural light and manufactured light must be dealt with and rejected. We must trust in God and experience Christ; then this very God in Christ will become our light.<p>What is light manufactured by human hands? Suppose that in the local church there is a brother whose mentality is not adequate. Therefore, someone recommends that he should go to see a psychiatrist. This signifies the light of the lamp, the manufactured human light. You may ask what we should do then with this brother. We must pray, and sometimes we must even fast. We need to deny the human way and look to the Lord. He will be our light; He will enlighten us as to what we should do. In all things we must deny the natural way, the natural light, as well as the human way, the human light. We must trust in the Lord, realizing that He is our light. We need to experience God more and more. In the holy city, there is only God; God Himself must be our experience in all aspects.<p>Some brothers have too many lights: they have the light of the sun, the light of the moon, the light of the stars, the light of candles, the light of oil lamps and electric lights. They have too many ways. In the church life we must learn how to drop all these kinds of lights. There is only one light which is needed, and that is God Himself. He is the light and the way! He is everything! We must reject all other ways, all other lights. To do this involves learning some real lessons.<h2 class=head1>27) WITHOUT NIGHT</h2><p>Our twenty-seventh point is that there is no night in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:25; 22:5). We have previously indicated that day and night will continue in the new earth, for there is still the sun and the moon. But because God enlightens the holy city, neither the sun nor the moon is needed; thus there is no night within the city. What is the meaning of this? At night we are tired and asleep; hence, the absence of night signifies that we will never be tired. In the New Jerusalem we will no longer require sleep, for we will continually experience resurrection power. We become tired because we are still in the old creation. Night is something of the old creation. Today, in the church life, we are still physically in the old creation; thus there is always a certain period when we are tired. Spiritually speaking, however, we should never be tired; we should never grow weary in the spirit. There should not be any night in the church.<h2 class=head1>28) TWO CURRENTS AND TWO CITIES</h2><p>In our twenty-eighth point we must see that throughout the Scriptures there are two currents with two cities. One current is of Satan, and the other is of God. With the current of Satan there is a city called the Great Babylon (Rev. 17:5), and with the current of God there is the holy city, New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). The book of Revelation unveils these two cities. The Great Babylon is none other than the mingling of Satan with the human race. In the eyes of God, Babylon consists of all the worldly people. On the other hand, the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God with His people.<p>These two cities are never compatible. The holy city is always separated from Great Babylon, and Babylon is always seeking to damage the holy city. Eventually God must intervene to judge Great Babylon and build up the holy city. Even so, if the church is to be adequately built up today, there must always be a judgment upon all worldliness. Worldliness is the very element of Great Babylon. If we bring anything worldly into the building of the church, we are mixing Babylon with the holy city. God will never allow this! He will come in to vindicate Himself. We must be constantly alert to keep the building of the church separated from anything worldly, anything of the Babylonian city and its elements.<p>May we bring all of these points to the Lord in prayer. Pray for the church regarding all these things. I believe God&#8217;s Word will not be in vain. Something will be worked out on this earth, because God&#8217;s Word has been released.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM (CONTINUED)</h1><p>We have seen twenty-eight points concerning the New Jerusalem. There are still many additional points to cover.<h2 class=head1>29) THE CITY FOURSQUARE</h2><p>The twenty-ninth point is that the city is a large square. Revelation 21:16 says, &#8220;And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.&#8221; The measurement of the city is equal in three dimensions, each dimension being twelve times one thousand furlongs. From the perfect squareness of the city we must learn the principle that nothing in the church life should be oblique; everything must be straight and square.<p>Regarding the serpent, the real symbol of Satan, nothing is straight or square; every part of him is cunning and crooked. Many times brothers in the Lord have come to us and to other Christian workers to try to teach us to be a serpent. They feel we should not be so straight, so open, so frank, but rather a little &#8220;wise.&#8221; We have replied, &#8220;You are not teaching us to be wise, but to be cunning like the politicians.&#8221; In the church life we should never act like a lawyer in the law court or a diplomat in the United Nations. We are dear Christian brothers; we must be as straight as possible.<p>During His last week on earth, the Lord Jesus was confronted by the elders and Pharisees, the chiefs of the Jewish people. They asked the Lord who had given Him the authority to act as He did. The Lord did not answer these men immediately, but said, &#8220;I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men?&#8221; (Matt. 21:24-25). These men reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8220;If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him? But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.&#8221; They held a political conference, and they decided to tell the Lord Jesus, &#8220;We know not.&#8221; However, the Lord knew that they knew, but that they would not tell the truth; so He replied, &#8220;Neither tell I you.&#8221; In this passage (Matt. 21:23-27) the King James Version does not give the proper rendering. It quotes these men as saying, &#8220;We cannot tell&#8221;; but the Greek text means, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; These men lied, but the Lord Jesus would not lie. They were crooked, but the Lord Jesus was straight.<h2 class=head1>30) THE TRANSPARENT CITY</h2><p>The thirtieth point is that the New Jerusalem is completely transparent (Rev. 21:18, 21). This means that there is nothing opaque or hidden there. In the church life today everything must not only be pure and clean, but also transparent as crystal. There must be nothing covered or hidden. There are some real lessons to learn in this area. We must be checked and straightened, purified and made transparent, by the work of the cross. Anything in us which is cunning or hidden is of the enemy, of the serpent, of darkness. We may hide some &#8220;small&#8221; matter for one, two, or even twenty days; we may even conceal something for twenty months or possibly ten years; but on the first day of the eleventh year it will come to the surface. We can never hide anything for eternity. In the church everything must be clear and transparent.<h2 class=head1>31) THE CITY FULL OF GOD&#8217;S GLORY</h2><p>Because the city is so straight and transparent, it is full of the glory of God (Rev. 21:11, 23). Strictly speaking, the glory of God is the very content of the city, for the city is completely filled with His glory. This means that the city is a vessel to contain and express God. To illustrate this point, let us consider a common table lamp: a typical lamp has an outer covering called a lampshade, while within the lamp there is the fullness of light. The lamp expresses the light, and the light is the very content of the lamp and the shade. The glory of God is just God Himself being manifested. The New Jerusalem is full of God&#8217;s glory; therefore God is manifested in this city. The normal church life today is the same: it is full of God&#8217;s glory, manifesting and expressing God.<h2 class=head1>32) THE NUMBER TWELVE</h2><p>Next, the number twelve is used repeatedly in this city. We may use electricity to illustrate the symbolic meaning of numbers used in the New Jerusalem. It is exceedingly difficult to understand electricity; we cannot isolate a little of it and take it into our hands for study. We must instead use figures to represent certain aspects of electricity. Similarly, the numbers used in the holy city teach us much concerning the city and the church life today.<p>The number twelve is used at least ten times in Revelation 21 and 22. There are twelve gates with twelve angels, and these gates contain the names of the twelve tribes. Then there are twelve foundations with the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. The twelve gates are twelve pearls, and the twelve foundations are twelve precious stones. The city itself is in three dimensions, and each dimension is of twelve thousand furlongs. The measurement of the city wall is one hundred and forty-four cubits, which is twelve times twelve. In addition to this, the tree of life bears twelve manner of fruits within the city.<p>There are many ways by which the number twelve can be composed, but, according to the record of these two chapters, it is composed of three times four or four times three. How do we know this? Because there are three gates on each of the four sides of the city. Remember, three is the number of the Triune God, and four is the number of the creatures or creation. In the early chapters of Revelation the number seven is frequently used: there are seven churches, seven lampstands, seven stars, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven vials. This number is composed either of three plus four or four plus three. The book of Revelation begins with the number seven and ends with the number twelve. At the beginning there are four living creatures plus the Triune God. But at the end everything issues from multiplication. Addition signifies an adding together, whereas multiplication signifies a mingling together. Firstly, we as creatures have God added to us; then, from the time of regeneration, God is multiplied within us. We must be so mingled with God. The entire city of the New Jerusalem is a mingling of man with God-this is why the whole city is represented by the number twelve. The church life begins with the number seven and matures to the number twelve. This is a process. The church must begin with the divine nature being added to the human nature; then each person must be mingled with God. Seven must become twelve; this is the way the church life must proceed. The maturity of the church life is the very mingling of God with man. Whatever I do in the church must involve the mingling of God with myself. Before doing anything, I must check, &#8220;Am I doing this just by myself, or am I doing this by the mingling of God with me?&#8221; The number four by itself is not good, and six is worse. We must at least equal seven, which is man plus God, or eight, which is resurrection. Then we will be in the reality of number twelve. All our work must be in the mingling of God with us.<h2 class=head1>33) THE FOUNDATION</h2><p>Next we come to the foundation of the city, which we shall consider in six aspects. Ephesians 2:20 says that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. But in the New Jerusalem there are no prophets. We must realize that at the time of the Ephesian letter some things were still not fulfilled; hence prophecy was required. But when the New Jerusalem descends out of heaven, everything will be completed. The prophets will have to become someone else. Therefore, we should not work too hard to be a prophet. On the other hand, all the apostles abide forever, for on the twelve foundations of the city are the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb (Rev. 21:14). The apostles will abide through eternity because they represent six things:<h2 class=head2>a) The Testimony of God</h2><p>Firstly, the apostles signify that this new city, which is the building of God and the testimony of Jesus, is not of man, but of God (Gal. 1:10-12). None of the apostles are of man; all are of God. This is the real testimony, and we must apply this principle to ourselves. In the church life everything must be of God; there must not be anything of man. The foundation of the church life must only be of God. If there is any human element, sooner or later that will be a weak point and will be heavily attacked by the enemy. Such an element cannot withstand the enemy&#8217;s attack. If we initiate anything which is of man rather than completely of God, the foundation will not be strong. In every city we must allow the church life to be initiated only of God, not of ourselves.<h2 class=head2>b) The Mercy of God</h2><p>The apostles are also the real witnesses of God&#8217;s mercy. When we consider the twelve foundations, we must recognize the mercy of God. What is the difference between mercy and grace? Suppose that there are two brothers who love each other in the Lord. One day the first brother purchases a fine Bible and presents it to the second. This is an act of grace. Let us consider now a second instance in which the second brother is not so lovable; let us suppose he is a poor and dirty beggar. Such a person is not worthy of love, yet the first brother loves him and gives him a gift. This is an act of mercy. Mercy is more far-reaching than grace. God is not only a God of grace, but also a God of mercy. If there were some worthiness about us, we would qualify for God&#8217;s grace. But we are in a more pitiful state than a poor and dirty beggar. Praise God that His mercy is so far-reaching that it has reached poor sinners like us!<p>Now look closely at the twelve foundation stones. Every time I have studied the four Gospels, I have always said, &#8220;Poor, pitiful Peter!&#8221; Yet Peter was chosen and used by the Lord. He was adorned and equipped by mercy, and his name is on one of the foundations of the city. After the adornment of God&#8217;s mercy, Peter became qualified for God&#8217;s grace. If we are humble, we will realize how truly pitiful we are before the Lord, how worthless in His eyes. We need His mercy. But after we receive His mercy, we can praise Him and tell Him that now we qualify for His grace. Why? It has nothing to do with our qualifications; it is all the Lord&#8217;s mercy.<p>Consider the twelve Apostles. Peter was a poor fisherman (Matt. 4:18-19), and Matthew was a tax gatherer (Matt. 9:9; Luke 5:27). In those days people spit whenever a tax gatherer was mentioned. These men collected taxes for Caesar and the Roman Empire, not for the temple of God. They were despised and hated by their own countrymen; they were pitiful people. Yet one of them became an Apostle and eventually one of the twelve foundations of the glorious city of God. What a mercy! These twelve foundation stones will eternally declare God&#8217;s mercy. Oh, we must know the mercy of God!<h2 class=head2>c) The Grace of God</h2><p>The twelve foundation stones are also a witness of God&#8217;s grace. Most Christians today conceive of grace as something given to us by God. But God&#8217;s grace is nothing less than God Himself. God gives Himself to us as our enjoyment to meet all our needs. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says that it is no longer he, but Christ who lives within him. Again, he declares, &#8220;Yet not I, but the grace of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10). By putting these two verses together, we see that grace is nothing less than Christ Himself. Grace is God in Christ as my strength, my power, my enjoyment. These poor fishermen and a publican could become so important as parts of the foundation of the holy city, not only because of God&#8217;s mercy, but also because of God&#8217;s grace.<h2 class=head2>d) The Faithfulness of God</h2><p>It is also through God&#8217;s faithfulness that the Apostles have become the city&#8217;s foundation stones. In Scripture the rainbow is a sign of God&#8217;s faithfulness. God&#8217;s faithfulness encircles His throne. In the holy city, the foundation is not laid block by block, but layer upon layer, and each of the twelve layers is a different kind of precious stone. Every layer displays a special color. According to an expert who has studied this matter thoroughly, the layer upon layer of precious stones which compose the foundation of the city show forth the colors of the rainbow. This proves that the faithfulness of God is the very foundation of the city. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all looked for &#8220;the city which hath the foundations&#8221; (Heb. 11:10). They looked for such a city because that city is built upon the faithfulness of God. Psalm 89:2 says that the faithfulness of God is established in the very heavens. Strictly speaking, the twelve stones alone do not compose the foundations of this holy city; rather, the faithfulness of God bestowed upon the twelve stones makes up the foundations. The Apostles themselves are not sufficient to constitute the foundation. I would not have any trust in Peter and Matthew by themselves. But I realize that the faithfulness of God is with them, and I trust the faithfulness of God upon them. These twelve layers of precious stones as the foundation appear as a rainbow, eternally declaring God&#8217;s faithfulness.<h2 class=head2>e) Precious Stones</h2><p>All these precious stones were originally mere pieces of clay. Medical research has shown that we humans are basically a composition of dust. Our body consists of certain amounts of salt, copper, iron, sulphur, and other elements of this earth. How then did Peter, John and the ten other Apostles become such precious stones? By the work of transformation.<p>There are three kinds of precious materials in God&#8217;s building: gold, pearl, and precious stone. Gold requires no transformation, for it is an element in its original state as created by God. A precious stone, however, is a compound of several elements which have been pressed together under intense heat. It is not an entity in its original state; it requires a work of full transformation. The other material in God&#8217;s building, pearl, also needs some work of transformation. Pearl, as we have seen, clearly signifies regeneration; thus it constitutes the entrance, the gates, to the city. By regeneration we enter the sphere of the kingdom of God. But once we are in, we need to press on to the goal. By regeneration we receive the divine nature. From that time onward we need to be pressed and burned. But do not be frightened! We all appreciate Peter, John and the other disciples, but most of us little realize how much pressure they experienced. They are no more pieces of clay, but precious stones. They have been transformed through intense heat and pressure. Read the histories of Peter and John; see the sufferings through which they passed. They were pressed and burned till they became strong and precious. Consider Peter and John at the day of Pentecost: at that time they were no longer pieces of clay; they had become pieces of stone, so strong and precious.<p>For the church life today we need God&#8217;s life, God&#8217;s divine nature of gold. We also need the pearl of regeneration of life by Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. Eventually, we must become precious stones through the transformation work of the Spirit. All the members of Christ&#8217;s Body must be transformed that God may have the foundation and the wall of His city.<h2 class=head2>f) Twelve Varieties</h2><p>The twelve foundations of the city are composed of twelve kinds of precious stones (Rev. 21:19-20). This signifies oneness in variety. Not one stone is the same: Peter is one color, and John is another. Altogether, there are twelve colors seen in the Apostles-a real variety. Yet there is also oneness in this variety. The Peter and John of today never seem to be one, and this is the real problem. John does his work, and Peter does his. There is a variety, but no oneness. So many gifted brothers today do not agree to be one. Even brothers who are supposed to be working together are not one. Each one tries to convince the other to be the same as himself. Suppose that I am a stone of green jasper and you are a red sardis. The problem is that I will try to convince you to be green, and you will attempt to make me red. If I fail to convert you, then I will have nothing to do with you. This is pitiful! Can we respect someone else whose ministry is totally different from ours? We must. We must hate narrow-mindedness and the urge to convince and convert others to be like ourselves. Never forget that Peter is Peter and John is John. The Lord Jesus is too great and wonderful: He needs many different persons to express Himself; one individual Christian is not sufficient. It is a real mercy to be one of the stones and yet be different from others. There is no need to convince others to be the same as we are.<h2 class=head1>34) CHRIST PORTRAYED IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>Our thirty-fourth point concerns the Lord Jesus, as He is portrayed in the New Jerusalem. He is manifested in at least four items. First, He is the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). Even in eternity, the Lord Jesus will always be remembered as the Lamb who died for our redemption, who shed His blood for us, and who gave Himself as the very food of life to satisfy us. Secondly, this Lamb is also the lamp, in whom God is the light. (See Rev. 21:23; 22:5. In the King James Version, the word translated light is lamp in Greek.) The lamp is the very vessel of God, containing God and expressing God. God has embodied Himself in Christ, and this Christ as the embodiment of God is the center of the entire city. Even so, the church today must have Christ with God embodied in Him as the very center. Thirdly, this very Christ is the tree of life (Rev. 22:2), the source of all life supply. In the church life we must have Christ as the Lamb, the lamp, and as the tree of life. Fourthly, Christ is even the temple of the city (Rev. 21:22).<h2 class=head1>35) THE TEMPLE</h2><p>Historically speaking, there was a temple in the ancient city of Jerusalem, but in the New Jerusalem there is no temple (Rev. 21:22), for God Himself and Christ are the temple. We may ask, then, since God and Christ are the temple, are They the Dwellers within the city or are They the dwelling place? The answer is, They are both. They are the temple, where the serving ones will dwell and serve. A temple is a place where those who serve God dwell. We have already seen how the dwellers are the dwelling place, and the dwelling place consists of the dwellers. If we would dwell in the church today, we must be built into it, we must become a part of it. This is very subjective. The dwellers are also the dwelling place. If we are not built into the New Jerusalem, we will never get into that city. But here is something more: God is the very God whom we serve, but He is also the temple where we serve. That means that we serve God in God. These thoughts are exceedingly deep. Where are you serving God today? Are you in a material building or an organization? Oh, God and Christ are our temple! We must serve God in God; we must serve Christ in Christ. God Himself and Christ Himself are the temple in which we serve God and Christ.<h2 class=head1>36) GOD&#8217;S DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>The thirty-sixth point is that the holy city is also the dwelling place of God (Rev. 21:3). God and Christ dwell in this city. On one hand They are the temple in which we dwell, and on the other hand They are also the Dwellers within the city. This means that the New Jerusalem is a mutual habitation. God dwells in us, and we dwell in God. The church today is a habitation where God may dwell (Eph. 2:22), and God is the home where we may dwell (Psa. 90:1). This is not a new concept. Christ said in John 15, &#8220;Abide in me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 4). He is saying in essence, &#8220;I am your abode, and you are My abode.&#8221; So together with God we become a mutual habitation. How profound! To God we are the city, and to us God and Christ are the temple. We have the presence of God and Christ as the temple to us. We are not just before God&#8217;s presence and Christ&#8217;s presence; we are in God&#8217;s presence and Christ&#8217;s presence. The presence of God and Christ becomes a dwelling place for us. If we would serve God and Christ in the church, we must be surrounded by God and Christ, and covered by God and Christ. We must serve God and Christ in God and Christ. Oh, how much we need Him! He is the One whom we serve, and He is even the temple in which we serve. Do you realize and experience God and Christ in such a way? Do you serve God and Christ in such a way? This is intensely subjective.<p>Human logic argues that such a mutual habitation is absurd. Some may ask, &#8220;Who then is within, and who is without? If God and Christ are within us, how can they ever be outside of us? If God and Christ are in us, we can never dwell in God and Christ.&#8221; The best logician can never comprehend this. But consider, the air is within us and the air is also outside of us. The air is in me, and I am in the air. If the air were not in me, I would soon expire. And if I were not in the air, I could never breathe. It is not difficult to believe this subjective fact.<p>God and Christ are in you, and you are in God and Christ. Praise Him! We may experience this as a reality in our life. One day, in the new heaven and new earth, we will realize this in the fullest way. We will see how much God and Christ are to us. He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him; so we will enjoy His presence to the uttermost!<h2 class=head1>37) THE HOLIEST OF ALL</h2><p>This brings us to our thirty-seventh point. Another reason the holy city is without a temple is that the whole city is the temple. And since the city is foursquare and equal in three dimensions, the whole city is not just the temple, but the holiest of all. During the time of Noah and Abraham, the small tent and altar had very little shape. There was no outer court, holy place, or holiest of all. When God and the two angels visited Abraham, they abode with him outside the tent (Gen. 18). Then during the time of Moses there was the tabernacle with an altar, a building with more shape. The holiest of holies in this tabernacle was in three equal dimensions. Later, the temple of Solomon was built in the same pattern as the tabernacle, with the dimensions all enlarged. These second and third stages of God&#8217;s building had more form. Finally, the New Jerusalem, as the ultimate stage of God&#8217;s building, has just one part: everything is swallowed up by the holiest of holies. There is no longer an outer court or a holy place. Neither is there a need for the temple, for the whole city is the temple, and every part of the city has been translated into the holiest of all. This is one reason the city is called the holy city. Such a city is the ultimate manifestation of God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>38) GOD IS EVERYTHING</h2><p>Our thirty-eighth point is simply that by the time of the New Jerusalem, God is everything to us. Through all the stages of God&#8217;s building, God finally becomes everything to us in the holy city.<h2 class=head1>39) THE NAME OF GOD</h2><p>The thirty-ninth point is that the name of God is written upon the foreheads of all His seeking ones. God&#8217;s name on our forehead signifies that we belong to God and, even more, that we are one with God. God&#8217;s name is our name, for we are one with Him. When a woman marries, she takes the name of her husband. She is called by his name. Hence, God&#8217;s name written on our forehead proves and even declares that we belong to God and that we are one with God. These points are exceedingly deep and meaningful.<h2 class=head1>40) THE FACE OF GOD</h2><p>The fortieth point concerning the holy city is that we will see God&#8217;s face. This is unspeakably wonderful! We will see His face day by day forever. Perhaps the best illustration is that of a little babe: nothing can satisfy a little child like its mother&#8217;s face. To him, that is everything. One day we shall see God&#8217;s face, in Him, in His presence, and with His name.<h2 class=head1>41) PRIESTS UNTO GOD</h2><p>Our forty-first point is that in that city we shall serve God as priests. In eternity we will have nothing to do but serve God.<h2 class=head1>42) KINGS OVER THE NATIONS</h2><p>Our forty-second point is that we shall reign as kings over the nations. We will be the priests of God, and we will be the kings of the people. We will have a God to serve and a people to rule. Have you ever realized the status you will have in the New Jerusalem?<h2 class=head1>43) THE LIGHT OF THE NATIONS</h2><p>Our forty-third and final point is that the holy city will be the light of the nations. All the nations will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem, for this city will be the unique, universal lampstand. As the lampstand it will hold Christ as the lamp, with God in Christ as the light. God shines through Christ and through the city, and all the nations around will walk in the light of the city.<p>In conclusion, we must remember that this ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s building is a full picture of today&#8217;s church life. If we are such a miniature of the holy city, we will shine forth with God as the light. Then the unbelievers, the worldly people, will walk in our light. We will enlighten everyone around us. This is full of import. May we bring all these points to the Lord in prayer that we may fully realize what the church life is today, and that we may cooperate with God&#8217;s eternal intention.<p class=hbody>O Lord Jesus, Thy redeemed ones<br>Are Thy Body and Thy Bride;<br>As Thy fulness, Thine expression,<br>In her Thou art glorified.<br>Thou, her all in all forever,<br>She Thy riches doth declare;<br>Thou dost fully saturate her<br>And Thy glory with her share.</p><p class=hbody2>Lo, the holy city,<br>Full of God&#8217;s bright glory!<br>It is God&#8217;s complete expression<br>In humanity.</p><p class=hbody>God with man completely blended,<br>Mystery of godliness,<br>God in glory, full, resplendent,<br>Man, His dwelling, doth express.<br>&#8217;Tis a vessel universal<br>All God&#8217;s fullness to express;<br>All His beauty manifesting,<br>Mingled with His holiness.</p><p class=hbody>&#8217;Tis a living composition<br>Of the saints He hath transformed;<br>As the pearls and stones most precious,<br>To His image they&#8217;re conformed.<br>From the throne of God, its center,<br>Flows the living water free;<br>Christ the tree of life doth flourish,<br>Bearing fruit abundantly.</p><p class=hbody>&#8217;Tis th&#8217; eternal golden lampstand,<br>Holding Christ, the lamp of light;<br>God in Christ, the light of glory,<br>In the Spirit shineth bright!<br>&#8217;Tis the ultimate expression-<br>Man in God and God in man;<br>&#8217;Tis their mutual habitation,<br>Goal of God&#8217;s eternal plan.</p><p class=hbody>(Hymn #976 in Hymns)</p></body></html>
