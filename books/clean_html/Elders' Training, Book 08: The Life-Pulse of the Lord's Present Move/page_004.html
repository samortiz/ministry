<h2 class="head1">MEETING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL<br />
AND TEACH THE TRUTH<br />
ACCORDING TO THE REVELATION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The third principle of meeting is to preach the gospel and to teach the truth. However, our preaching and teaching must not be in an unrestricted way. We must be limited by the realm of the revelation of the New Testament economy of God. Our preaching and teaching must also be uplifted. Simply to be limited in the sphere, in the realm of the New Testament revelation is not adequate. Your preaching and your teaching should be up to the standard. I do not encourage you to preach in a low way. We have to preach in a high way.</p>
<p>In the Bible, you cannot see any kind of loose preaching. On the day of Pentecost the first message that came out of Peter&rsquo;s mouth was quite high, full of mysterious points. Some may point out that this message was given to the Jews, who had much knowledge of the Bible in the Old Testament. But in Acts 14 Paul gave a message to the Gentiles (vv. 15-17), and in Acts 17 he gave a message which was very deep and very high to the Greeks, the philosophical people (Acts 17:22-31). When Paul was speaking on Mars&rsquo; Hill, facing the Greek philosophers, he surely had to give a higher, deeper, philosophical preaching. All the terminology as well as the points Paul covered require much time to study. We should not preach or teach in a shallow way. We have to be restricted within the boundary of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and be uplifted to the standard of His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Just before I left my denomination, the preacher gave a sermon in the Sunday morning service on how to kill flies to promote sanitation. This was absolutely outside the boundary of the New Testament economy. In this country some pastors speak about politics and even sex in their meetings. This is terrible. Others speak about biblical prophecy. To talk about prophecy based upon the revelation of the New Testament economy is absolutely all right. But if you talk about prophecy for the sake of prophecy, you are off and you are outside the boundary. To talk about foot washing in relation to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is all right. But if you talk about foot washing for the sake of foot washing, you had better set up a foot washing church. This speaking causes division. If you talk about water baptism, and it is not related to the New Testament economy, that causes division. Even to talk about the baptism in the Spirit with no relation to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy causes division. This is why I speak of meeting to preach the gospel and to teach the truth, not just according to the New Testament but according to the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whatever you teach and preach must be restricted by this, and you must uplift your preaching and teaching to the standard of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>An architect would never allow a high tower to be erected in the middle of a building, unrelated to the rest of it. Those who uplift speaking in tongues raise up a high tower unrelated to the building. To those who do this, it seems that the whole body is only a tongue. The best architect surely would &ldquo;cut this tongue down to its proper size.&rdquo; Paul cut in this way in chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians. He surely was the wise architect who did much cutting in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>As a layman architect I designed the meeting hall in Anaheim. I did not make the drawings, but I made the design. In my first design I placed an elevator in the middle of one end of the building. After the concrete was poured, I realized that the design was wrong, and I convinced the brothers to change it. As the unique architect I made many adjustments. I cut off this corner, and I cut off that corner. This was a great cutting to some of the brothers. Although it cost much to take this elevator out, we just could not leave it in. This illustrates that to take the lead is not an easy thing. We must learn to take the lead by looking into the holy Word to see the entire view of God&rsquo;s economy, the plan, the arrangement, the design in His New Testament. We must have a clear view of God&rsquo;s arrangement, God&rsquo;s design. To be an architect is not easy.</p>
<p>The stairway in the meeting hall also was designed by me. Certain brothers who were carpenters considered the design to be strange and built a sample of their own design to show to me. It seemed as if I was one who knew nothing about carpentry, yet I insisted on my design. They had no choice but to build it. Eventually, the fire department awarded us an extra ten percent in seating capacity because the stairways and doors were so good. A &ldquo;layman&rdquo; designed them. Today whoever comes to the meeting feels so happy about the stairway. No one who comes up these stairs has the feeling that he is climbing. An apostle, an architect, a wise master builder, must be one who can give us the proper design.</p>
<p>To see the basic principles of meeting in the Word is not easy, but to use these principles in the meetings will never cause any division. This way to meet will never give rise to any opinions. Perhaps these principles will calm down all the different opinions. Brothers, take care of the way to meet. Do not change the way of meeting in an easy way. Whatever way you take to meet, you must take care of the matter of division. You must take care of the matter of opinion. The issue of the way of meeting may lead to opinions and result in division, as it did among us in years past.</p>
