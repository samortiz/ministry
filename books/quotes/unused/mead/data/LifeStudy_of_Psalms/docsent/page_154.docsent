   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Remembering God from a Distance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The psalmist remembered God from a distance from the land of the Jordan and the Hermons, from Mount Mizar, quite far from Zion and Jerusalem, where God's house and city were.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 42:6 says, "O my God, my soul is bowed down within me;/Therefore I remember You/From the land of the Jordan and the Hermons,/From Mount Mizar."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the psalmist was away from his home, from his country, from his nation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He remembered the Lord not from the door of the temple or from the gate of Jerusalem but from far away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because he was in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was during the time when the people of Israel, including those serving in the temple, had been defeated and captured by their invading enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This psalmist was such a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sons of Korah were Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Korah was a leader of the Levites who served the temple Num 16:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The invaders defeated Israel and captured the people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the psalmist here was in a far away country.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>G. Recognizing God's Sovereignty</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>in Their Environment</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 42:7-9a shows that the psalmist recognized God's sovereignty in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 7 says, "Deep calls unto deep/At the sound of Your water spouts;/All Your waves and Your billows/Pass over me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some versions render "water spouts" as "waterfalls."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This poetic expression describes the sufferings through which the psalmist passed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 8 says, "By day Jehovah commands/His lovingkindness,/And by night His song is with me,/A prayer to the God of my life."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, while he was passing through such a deep suffering, all the psalmist could do was to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the day he enjoyed God's lovingkindness; in the night he enjoyed Jehovah's song being with him, a prayer to the God of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 9 and 10 say, "I say to God my rock,/Why have You forgotten me?/Why do I go mourning/Because of the oppression of the enemy?/As with a shattering in my bones, /My adversaries reproach me,/While they say to me all day long,/Where is your God?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His adversaries asked him where his God was since he was in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of these thoughts came in to distract the psalmist from panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see the mixed expressions of the sentiment of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he was writing such a psalm, all kinds of distracting thoughts came to his mind, distracting him from panting after God and from the salvation of God's countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 11 he said, "Why are you bowed down, O my soul?/And why are you disquieted within me?/Hope in God; for I will yet praise Him,/The salvation of my countenance and my God."</S>
