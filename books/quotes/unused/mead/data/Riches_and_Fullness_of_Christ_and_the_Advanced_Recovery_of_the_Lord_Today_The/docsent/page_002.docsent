   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE RICHES OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Phil 2:6-8; John 5:17; Heb 1:2-4; Eph 3:18, 8, 9-11 OUTLINE The all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ: His person, nature, experience, work, accomplishments, and attainments all being excellent beyond comparison Phil 2:6-8; John 5:17; Heb 1:2-4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His measure being the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe Eph 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The riches of Christ Eph 3:8: Being unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Preached as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Producing the church, for the fulfillment of God's eternal and mysterious economy Eph 3:9-11.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The last time I was in the Philippines was four years ago, in 1985.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This time, I see many new faces.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am especially overjoyed to see that the majority of you are young people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My burden this time is mainly in three areas.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first concerns Christ, the second concerns the church, and the third concerns the Lord's present recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are the main points of this conference: Christ, the church, and the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These three points are not God's recovery of yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, they are the Lord's present recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS AND UNLIMITEDNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the specific and central theme of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the revelation of the Old and New Testaments, Christ is too deep, too high, too wide, and too broad.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can never exhaust speaking about Him, nor can we measure Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Usually, when we talk about Christ, we make Him too common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We say that "Christ is loving,'' "Christ is merciful,'' "Christ is forgiving,'' and "Christ is patient.''</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But all these descriptions are too shallow and common.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The terms used by the Bible to describe Christ are all very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, man tends to neglect them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we want to see all of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first item of these riches is the all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His all-inclusiveness speaks of His content, and the unlimitedness speaks of His measure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as His content is concerned, He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is not one thing that He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, He has a special title: the "I Am'' Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is a God in the universe, then surely He has to be the one Rom 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is a man in the universe, surely He is man also 1 Tim 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is even you and I. He is even every person who is in the churches Col 3:11 . His content is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition, His measure is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe Eph 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When man landed on the moon, he reached a certain height.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the moon is only a part of the solar system.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The universe is billions and billions of times larger than the solar system.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since Christ can be compared to the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe, His measure must necessarily be unlimited.</S>
