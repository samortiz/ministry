   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SON AND THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see clearly in order to see the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should never think that the Triune God is three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can never separate the Son of God from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 14:8-10 Philip asked the Lord to show them the Father and they would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord immediately rebuked him by saying, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He told Philip that the Father was in Him, and that He was in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are the Son and the Father two or one?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the pure Word of the Bible, we should not separate the Son from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Son and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is there then no difference?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, there is some difference, for the Son is the Son and the Father is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Son is also called the Father in Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we see that it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SON AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, we should not separate the Spirit from the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Bible, this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have at least two verses which tell us that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, Now the Lord is that Spirit, and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit A.S.V. . Then is there no difference between Christ and the Holy Spirit? Surely there is some difference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the Christ, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But to say that they are two is also wrong, because these clear verses tell us that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a real mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we come to the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, it is absolutely not wise to separate Christ from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 3:27 says, For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you been baptized into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When were you baptized into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christian teachers insist on saying that Christ is the baptizer, but here it says that we have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This translation in the King James Version is according to the original Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ the baptizer has baptized us into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that Christ has baptized us into the Spirit is logical.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But to say that Christ has baptized us into Himself is rather mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because Christ is not only the baptizer, but also the Spirit into whom He has baptized us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, to be baptized into Him is to be baptized into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This corresponds to 1 Corinthians 12:13 which says, In one Spirit were we all baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we should never separate the Holy Spirit from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit is just the realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit is nothing less than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why He is called the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without the Holy Spirit, we can never realize Christ, meet Christ, or touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today Christ dwells in us, and the Spirit also dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This simply means that the two as one dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After His ascension, Christ became qualified, approved, anointed, and inaugurated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, He was committed with all the necessary things to complete God s project.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first step He took after this was to come down in the form of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, He was the baptizer, and on the other hand, He was the Spirit for this baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the Head of the Body, He was the baptizer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He put all of God s chosen people into the Spirit, that is, into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the day of Pentecost, the ascended, approved, and inaugurated Christ came down in the form of the Spirit into whom His people were immersed.</S>
