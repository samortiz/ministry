   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the anointing does not change us, it has a good function.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, it rebukes us, and secondly, it tells us to return to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps all of us have misunderstood 1 John 2:27, which says that the same anointing teacheth you of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The anointing does not teach us to do everything; it teaches us to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some brothers and sisters may wonder whether or not to go shopping and they pray to the Lord, saying, O Lord, should I go shopping or stay home?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, grant me the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord may say, My anointing doesn t care for your going shopping or staying home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My anointing only cares that you abide in Me. As long as you abide in Me, you may go anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you abide in Me, whatever you do will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we abide in Christ, we may go anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But remember this crucial clause if we abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we abide in Christ, God does not care where we go or what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many who are concerned about marriage pray to the Lord regarding it, saying, Lord, should I marry this one?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some can testify that although they prayed in this way, the Lord never answered their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many young brothers have prayed, saying, Lord, let me know whether this sister is the dear one You have chosen for me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the more the brothers pray like this, the more confused they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I know of some sisters who have prayed for ten years about getting married without receiving an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Lord were to answer them, He would probably say, I don t care about your marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I only care whether or not you abide in Me. If you abide in Me, you may get married.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if you do not abide in Me, you should not even marry the best brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only thing that counts is whether or not we abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God s economy, it is not a matter of our doing; it is absolutely a matter of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a matter of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And what we are depends upon the life according to which we live day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BEING RECOVERED TO THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In ancient times, the people of Israel got off the center, which is God s law, and God sent the prophets to bring them back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today most Christians are away from God s center, which is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the epistle of 1 John was written to the degraded Christians, calling them back to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law of life is a basic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because it is basic, it is mentioned in the book of Romans, a book of basic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The anointing, on the contrary, is not mentioned in any of the basic books.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it is mentioned in a book dealing with degradation, because many Christians had been distracted by the teachings of the antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the First Epistle of John, John told them to care for the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John seemed to be saying, The anointing tells you what to do and where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Don t listen to the teachings of the antichrists obey the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The anointing will bring you back to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First John 2 brings us back to Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we are truly living in Romans 8, we do not need 1 John 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, if the Israelites had never gone astray from God s law, there would have been no need for the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From now on, we should live according to the law of life and not just move according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God cares for His nature, but His presence is our safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s nature is within us, and we must live according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we must live according to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we are often distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In times of distraction, God s presence will watch over us, observe us, and warn us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we stray from the law of life, the anointing will say, No!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After we say, Lord, I repent, then the anointing will tell us to return to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In a foregoing message, I said that we must live according to the law of life and move according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The anointing represents God s presence directing us, correcting us, and bringing us back to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must live according to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we must live and walk according to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why is it easy to grasp the matter of the anointing but difficult to get into the law of life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is easy to know a brother by his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With even a short glimpse, we can easily recognize his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But it takes a great deal of time to get into his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps his wife, who has lived with him for many years, is the only one who has gotten into his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may know this brother s face, but we do not know his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In like manner, it is easy to apprehend God s presence, but it is difficult to know His nature in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Merely to tell people to walk in the presence of God is rather natural and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But to know God s nature within our being and to live according to it is exceedingly deep.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is what God desires.</S>
