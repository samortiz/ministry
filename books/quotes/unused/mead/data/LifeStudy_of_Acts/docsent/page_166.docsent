   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOOD OF JESUS, THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The blood that has redeemed fallen human beings is the blood of Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As human beings, we need genuine human blood for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because He was a man, the Lord Jesus could fulfill this requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a man, He shed human blood to redeem fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is also the Son of God, even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, with His blood there is the element of eternity, and this element ensures the eternal efficacy of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, as a man He had genuine human blood, and as God He has the element that gives to His blood eternal efficacy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First John 1:7 says that the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The name Jesus denotes the Lord s humanity, which was needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title His Son denotes the Lord s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God s fallen creatures with the divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy which is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blood the Lord shed on the cross was the blood of Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was not only the blood of Jesus; it was also the blood of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, the redemption accomplished by the God-man, by the One mingled with God, is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the redemption accomplished on the cross was accomplished merely by a man, that redemption could not be eternally effective.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although it might be effective for the redemption of one person, it would not be effective for the redemption of millions of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since a man is limited, a particular man cannot die for millions of others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, although man is limited, God is not limited.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, although man is temporal, God is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in Christ s redemption there is the eternal and unlimited element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason that in Hebrews 9:12 this redemption is called an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to see that the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross is eternal blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the blood not merely of a man but of a man mingled with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, this blood, the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 20:28 Paul had the boldness to speak of this blood as being God s own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE GOD REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of today s Christians have a concept of God that is very similar to the Jewish concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Jewish concept of God is that God is God and that there is no human element in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But according to the Bible, the very God in the Old Testament has become the God revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament God was merely God, without any human element.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in the New Testament we see the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through incarnation the God in the Old Testament put on human nature and became the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such, He became God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God became the God-man by being conceived in the womb of a human virgin and then being born of that virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way the human element was added to His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this does not mean that as the God-man the Savior has two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No, the Lord Jesus, the Savior, has one person with two natures the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although this is very difficult to understand, it is nevertheless a fact revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we can see that our God is the God revealed in the New Testament and not merely the God as He is revealed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Jews, however, have God only as He is seen in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is the difference between the Jewish God and our God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The difference is that the Jewish God is merely God without a human element, whereas, according to the New Testament, our God is no longer merely God He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our God has two natures, the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that our God, the God-man, is both the complete God and a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, He is not two persons; rather, the God-man is one person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we have always believed and taught that the God-man, Jesus Christ, is one person with the divine nature and the human nature and that He is both the complete God and a perfect man, certain opposers have falsely accused us of teaching that Christ was neither fully God nor fully man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They accuse us of saying that the two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, are mingled in Christ to produce a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This accusation is utterly false and baseless, and we repudiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who have made this false accusation against us do so by twisting our word in the booklet The Four Major Steps of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In that booklet we say clearly and emphatically that our Savior is both the real God and the true man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through incarnation neither the divine nature nor the human nature is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, although the divine and human natures are mingled to form the God-man, both the divine nature and the human nature remain, and a third nature is by no means produced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although this truth was clearly defined and presented, it was twisted in an evil way in an attempt to accuse us of heresy concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the Scriptures, we definitely believe that our Savior, who shed His blood for our redemption, died on the cross as the God-man.</S>
