   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Strengthened with Power through His Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moreover, Paul asked the Father to grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our inner man is our regenerated spirit, which has God's life as its life and is indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is also our new person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our inner man, in brief, is our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider how much you remain in your spirit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psychologists classify human beings, according to human disposition, as introverts and extroverts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A so-called introvert is a person whose interest is not in the things outside of him but in the things within himself; he does not like to talk and does not have much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A so-called extrovert is a person whose interest is more on the things outside of him than on the things within himself; he likes to talk and has many things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the "inner man" referred to in the Bible is the real "introvert."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the biblical sense, a person is an "extrovert" regardless of whether he speaks much or speaks little; only when he turns to his spirit is he truly an "introvert."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times it requires the combined strength of nine oxen and two tigers for us to return to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes even in the meetings we are not in our spirit, and it usually takes us half an hour to return to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 3:16 is really profound and hard to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul prayed for us to be strengthened into the inner man and not to remain in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you talk endlessly, surely you are in your outer man, yet even when you sit in meditation without praying or fellowshipping, you are in your mind and are therefore still in your outer man, not in your inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is hard to comprehend the difference between the outer man and the inner man, and we often mistake one for the other.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened, in particular to be strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are weak, obviously we are in our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the meetings once we criticize, judge, or despise others, this proves that we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet even if we do not criticize, judge, or despise others, merely sitting in the meeting without functioning, having no strength to pray or call on the Lord also shows that we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this time we really need the Spirit to strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who directs the Spirit to strengthen us?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the Father; He initiates, directs, and manages, causing the Spirit to stir us up and fan us into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have the experience of being weak most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though we know that the Lord does not want us to buy a certain thing, we still buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we pick up something in the department store, and the Lord tells us to put it down, we just cannot put it down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The strangest thing is that we have the strength to pick it up, but do not have the strength to put it down; we are strong to pick it up, but we are weak to put it down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, sometimes we also have another kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we are struggling, suddenly there is a surge of strength within us, so that we are able to put the item down and leave without saying a word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe that this is the effect of Paul's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only so, many times when you are about to quarrel with your spouse or argue with another believer, you begin to say something and suddenly stop half way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because you have been strengthened into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you go back to your room and pray, "Lord, forgive me, because I almost acted out of my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank You for being merciful to me and preserving me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the Spirit strengthening you from within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once you are strengthened, you are able to enter into your inner man.</S>
