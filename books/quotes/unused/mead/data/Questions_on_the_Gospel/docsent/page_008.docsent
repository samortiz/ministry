   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION FOUR CONCERNING ROMANS 4:7 AND HEBREWS 9:26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are our sins "covered over" Rom 4:7 or "put away" Heb 9:26 ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the distinction between these two?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our sins are "put away," not "covered."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 9:26 says clearly that the Lord was manifested once at the consummation of the ages to offer Himself as a sacrifice to put away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How then can the phrase "covered over" in Romans 4:7 be explained?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that the words of this verse are quoted from Psalm 32:1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the entire New Testament, except for this verse, we cannot find another verse that says our sins are covered over before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Covered over" signifies that the sins of the people of the Old Testament time were covered over.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament, every sin was only covered over and not put away until the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For "He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant " Heb 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us first remember that "redemption" or "atonement" in the Old Testament means "to cover up" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament there is no other place, except in Romans 4:7, where the phrase "covered over" is quoted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, in the Bible, the word propitiation, except in a few cases where it is translated in conjunction with cover, refers to a "sin offering," that is, a sacrifice offered for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus Christ is the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He offered Himself for our sins; He did not cover our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus came to put away our sins, not to cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" John 1:29 .</S>
