<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. JEHOVAH THE HUSBAND'S CORRECTION</H2><P>Jehovah the Husband's correction is found in 4:3-31.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Admonishing Her<br>to Break Up Her Fallow Ground<br>and Not to Sow among Thorns</H2><P>Jehovah admonished her to break up her fallow ground and not to sow among thorns (v. 3); He also admonished her to circumcise herself to Jehovah and remove the foreskins of her heart (v. 4a). This indicates that as they were busy worshipping idols, they were sowing among thorns. But the proper land, the land in which they should have been sowing, remained fallow, untouched. They should sow everything in the presence of God, with God, and for God. This is to use the land properly. Instead they worshipped idols and sowed among thorns. Thus, God advised them to stop that kind of sowing and return to the fallow ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Warning Them with Evils, Woes, and Afflictions</H2><P>In verses 4b through 31 Jehovah warned them with evils (calamities), woes, and afflictions. He warned them with all kinds of sufferings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. His Wrath Going Forth like a Fire</H2><P>In 4b Jehovah spoke of His wrath going forth like a fire and burning Israel. Such a fire would bring in calamities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Evil and Great Destruction<br>Coming from the North</H2><P>Jehovah said that He was bringing evil and great destruction from the north, referring to Babylon (v. 6b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. A Lion Coming Up to Make<br>Her Land a Waste and Her Cities Ruins</H2><P>"A lion has come up from his thicket, / And a destroyer of nations has set out. / He has gone forth from his place / To make your land a waste; / Your cities will be ruins, / Without an inhabitant" (v. 7). The lion here refers to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar was a destroyer of nations and he would make Israel's cities ruins.</P>
