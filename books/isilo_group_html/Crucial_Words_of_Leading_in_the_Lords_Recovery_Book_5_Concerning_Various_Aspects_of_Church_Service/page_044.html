but Being Members One of Another</h2>
<p>We need to consider what 1 Timothy 3 says concerning the person of the elders and deacons. However, if we read only this chapter, we may think that it shows rank. First Timothy 3 first mentions the elders (vv. 1-7) and then deacons (vv. 8-13), as if elders are higher and deacons are lower. However, the Bible is not one-sided. Romans 12:4-5 says, &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; Moreover, both 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4 say that we are members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we look at our physical body, we may say that the feet are lower than the legs. However, such a thought does not exist in our head. Being high or low is an organizational view, but in the organism of a body, there is only a distinction of function. There is no distinction related to a member being high or low. If the eye is higher than the nose, then we would ask, does the nose rule the mouth, or does the mouth rule the nose? In the Bible there is no distinction of being high or low; such a distinction exists only in an organization. We are all members one of another in the one Body of Christ. There is no high or low but only the distinction of function. The most we can say is that we are in one communication, one fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Co-workers Not Being<br />
a Special Class in the Body</h2>
<p>The co-workers are merely members in the Body of Christ. They are not greater than other saints. The co-workers should not regard themselves as a special class of people. Some co-workers consider themselves to be higher than the saints. Although they do not say so, their mannerism and their airs indicate it. We must realize that we are merely sinners who have been graced by the Lord. In Christ&rsquo;s Body we are merely members who have received mercy from the Lord. There is nothing in us that is higher than the saints.</p>
<p>Therefore, the elders should not give orders to the deacons, and neither should the deacons consider themselves to be subordinates to the elders. We are in the Body of Christ. The saints who are responsible for a service do not need to report back to the elders. The elders should not give orders when they need help; rather, they should get help through fellowship. Forty years ago when I was in the church in Chefoo, every item in the service was put into good order. I even got involved in the cleaning and took the lead to clean. Before I got involved, none of the elders were involved, but after I took the lead, they all followed.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei needs to have a new beginning. We hope that all the elders will also take the lead and sometimes vacuum the floor of the meeting hall. If the brother leading the cleaning assigns a sister, who works as a house servant, to clean the toilets, and then assigns another sister, who is the wife of a banker, to dust the lectern, others will feel that this brother is prejudiced. However, if we simply change and let the banker&rsquo;s wife clean the toilet and the servant dust the lectern, we are being political to avoid criticism. We must consider the brothers and sisters as the same, without any concept of rank, and therefore do everything through fellowship. May we have a good beginning; I trust that the Lord will be with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO MOVES OF GOD IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>We will now see two crucial matters that concern the Lord&rsquo;s move in Taiwan. May we all receive the burden to pray for these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building a Large Meeting Hall<br />
with the Capacity of Ten Thousand</h2>
<p>The first matter concerns the building of a large meeting hall. The church in Taipei is the largest locality in Taiwan; the Lord has a large possession here. In order for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to move forward, for all the churches to be established, and for those who have a heart to be raised up, perfected, and cultivated, we need to build a large meeting hall in Taipei. We should try our best to build a meeting hall with the capacity of ten thousand people. If we feel that we should do this, we need to pray earnestly and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We also need to consider many details in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Evangelizing Taiwan in Five Years</h2>
<p>The second matter is to evangelize Taiwan in five years. This is not a light matter. After considering the various situations in Taiwan related to society, economy, transportation, and education, we feel that Taiwan is the most ideal field for our work. The gospel candidates here are also the best. In Taipei alone, there are over six hundred thousand students from primary school to college. Eight hundred saints would not be too many to preach the gospel and meet the needs of these six hundred thousand students. I have been serving the Lord and doing His work for fifty-three years, and I have never seen a place so suitable for the work. We are the Lord&rsquo;s possessions. When we came here thirty-five years ago, our possession was not large. However, now there are at least ten thousand saints living in the church life in Taiwan. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day the total attendance is about six thousand. These saints, together with the meeting halls, are a great possession. If we would gradually mobilize the saints, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace there will be an effect.</p>
<p>My desire is that we would utilize the possessions that we have in coordination with a society that is suitable for the gospel. We will use five years, from 1985 to 1990, to evangelize the entire island of Taiwan. We will work out an environment where there will be a church in every town and every village.</p>
<p>My fellowship with you concerning this matter is related to two intentions. First, I hope that we will pray and ask the Lord to give us a clear leading. Second, since we are learning how to serve in these meetings, we are telling you what our feeling is and the goal toward which the Lord is leading us. Our goal is to evangelize Taiwan in five years so that there will be a church in every town and every village. In order to reach this goal, we must try our best to obtain a large meeting hall.</p>
<p>Once these two matters are well under way, many other positive things will take place. Many brothers and sisters will make material offerings, and a substantial number of saints will migrate to Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, and Burma. Currently there are temples and pagodas in every town and village in Taiwan. We must depend on the Lord&rsquo;s grace so that every town and village has a church. We believe that this will bring in a great blessing to this country. Since our God is the true God and our Lord is the Lord, we must speak Him forth and dispense Him so that the gospel can be spread to all our countrymen for them to obtain salvation. This is not an empty dream. We have an environment and a large possession. As long as we are faithful to mobilize every church, beginning with Taipei, we believe that we will accomplish this goal in five years.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
