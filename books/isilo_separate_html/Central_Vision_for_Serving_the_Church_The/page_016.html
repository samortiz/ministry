<p>The true God is no longer only in the heavens. He has entered into our spirit. Anything apart from the true God is an idol. Hence, verse 21 says, &ldquo;Guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; We should never think that idols are limited to objects in temples. Our natural zeal for the Lord is an idol that replaces the true God. Our natural selection of hymns, our natural service, and our lack of the exercise of our spirit are idols. Only that which is out of our regenerated spirit is the true God.</p>
<p>Many years ago I did not understand why 1 John 5:21 suddenly says, &ldquo;Little children, guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; These words seem to be a disconnected thought. I later understood that anything not done in our regenerated spirit is an idol. The apostle John admonished us to flee idols, that is, to flee everything that is not from our spirit. It is right to desire to be meek, broad, humble, and long-suffering, but do these virtues originate from our regenerated spirit? If they originate from our regenerated spirit, they are of the true God; if they do not, they are idols.</p>
<p>May we all see this vision. God wants to work Himself into us to be our life, and He wants to live in oneness with us in our spirit. He does not want us to do things for Him, nor does He care for other things. He is concerned only with whether we are living in oneness with Him in our spirit. We need to see this vision and let this vision control us. Our prayer, our speaking, our testimony, and our Bible reading must come out of this vision to speak forth this vision. If we truly see this vision, we will know what is of our natural zeal and whether our worship, singing, and prayers are routine.</p>
<p>The Jews built the temple in Jerusalem according to God&rsquo;s instruction. In front of the temple there was an altar. The priests wore priestly robes and served according to the Scriptures. They offered up sacrifices at the altar and entered into the Holy Place to burn incense and light the lamps. Their worship of God was orthodox, but God came to be among men. He was born in a manger, traveled to Egypt, and returned to Nazareth (Luke 2:16; Matt. 2:13-15, 19-23). After being hidden for thirty years, He began to preach in Judea. He even reclined at a table in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany, along with Martha, Mary, and Lazarus (John 12:1-3; Mark 14:3; Matt. 26:6-7). Although this house in Bethany was humble, God was there with the disciples. Although the Jewish priests were in the temple offering sacrifices, worshipping God, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense in their priestly robes according to the Scriptures, God was not there. If we have insight, we will see that the true God, the eternal life, was in that humble house, while there were &ldquo;idols&rdquo; in the temple (1 John 5:19-21). At that time, even the temple, the priests in their priestly robes, the sacrifices, the incense-burning, and the lighting of the lamps were in the evil one.</p>
<p>We should not be concerned that the Lord Jesus is in a &ldquo;humble house,&rdquo; but we need to consider whether we are serving religiously in &ldquo;the temple.&rdquo; We may think that we are worshipping God but have little realization that we are actually under the authority of darkness and worshipping idols. The true God, the eternal life, is in our spirit. We need to sit at His feet and have intimate fellowship with Him in our spirit. God was not in the routine worship in the temple. The items related to the temple, including the priests in their priestly robes and the routine burning of incense and lighting of lamps had fallen into the hands of Satan; they had become &ldquo;idols.&rdquo; Therefore, the apostle John said, &ldquo;Guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; If we have a vision, we will understand that Judaism had become degraded. The Jewish synagogues were originally for worshipping God, but Revelation 2:9 says, &ldquo;Those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.&rdquo; Not only has Judaism become degraded, but even Catholicism and Protestantism have become degraded. Hence, we must be careful not to become a &ldquo;synagogue of Satan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything that is not of the Spirit of God is under the authority of Satan. Religion teaches people to worship God without God; therefore, it belongs to the synagogue of Satan. If our breaking of bread is a ritual that does not have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and is not in our spirit, we are worshipping idols, not the true God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). The Lord is not in rituals; He is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This is the vision that we need. We need to prostrate ourselves before the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. Without Your mercy, I am blind and cannot see.&rdquo; Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are like Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus. We may think that we are zealously serving God, but in fact, we may be under the authority of Satan and in the realm of idols. An idol is anything that is an outward form and is without the Lord. We have the Lord only when we are in spirit. Having an outward form without the spirit is to have an idol, a religion. If we do not have a vision, we are worshipping idols and are not serving God. We may teach others about holiness, victory, and bearing the cross, but if we are not in spirit, we will not lead others to be in spirit. We need to turn to our spirit and dive into our spirit so that the true God may operate in our spirit. Only then can we say that our worship and service are according to the true God and eternal life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
