   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Power for Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The four spices plus the oil are five elements.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The five hundred and two hundred fifty shekels also involve the number five.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The number five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the compound Spirit is the One who bears all responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without this ointment anointing us, we cannot do anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot be responsible for anything pertaining to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But with this anointing Spirit, we surely have the capacity to bear any kind of responsibility for God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Compound Spirit for Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The compound Spirit is the consummation of the processed, compounded Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Spirit is for anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything that is related to God s worship, to God s service, must be anointed by this compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The compound ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle with all its furniture, the altar with all its utensils, the laver with its base, and the priests Exo 30:26-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The function of the holy anointing oil as a compound ointment is to sanctify the things of God and the men of God, separating them from anything common and making them most holy for God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word anointing is used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 2:20 says that we have received the anointing, and verse 27 says that this anointing will teach us in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told us in 2 Corinthians 1:21 that it is God who has anointed us and that God has attached us to Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have been attached to Him, His anointing becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are under the anointing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The anointing is the moving of the compounded, ultimately consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The compound Spirit is moving within us, anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the ointment anoints us, all the elements of the ointment become our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anointing can be compared to painting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paint is a compound, a kind of ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When something is painted, the elements of the paint are applied to it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are being anointed, painted, with the compound ointment, and all the elements of this ointment are being applied to our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This anointing is taking place within us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT THE DIVINE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>MINGLED WITH OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mingled spirit is the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit Rom 8:4-6, 16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is hard for Bible teachers to discern whether Paul is talking about the divine Spirit or our human spirit in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, Paul is talking about the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Paul tells us to walk according to spirit in Romans 8:4 and to set our mind upon the spirit in verse 6, he is referring to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To signify the mingled spirit, we may put a small letter s within a capital letter S. Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two spirits are working as one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 6:17 says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How wonderful it is that we are one spirit with the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are joined to the Lord, who is the Spirit, and we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS THE SEVENFOLD SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TYPIFIED BY THE SEVEN LAMPS OF THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven Spirits are the sevenfold Spirit, typified by the seven lamps of the lampstand Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; Exo 25:31, 37; Zech 4:2, 10; 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew 28:19 says that we need to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Revelation 1:4 and 5 speak of the divine Trinity, the Spirit is referred to as the seven Spirits who are before His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By comparing Revelation 1:4 and 5 with Matthew 28:19, we can realize that the seven Spirits are just the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seven Spirits are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God in Revelation 1:4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seven Spirits are before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The throne of God is for God s move in His administration, in His government.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may also say that the throne is for God s move in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word economy means arrangement, household administration, or household government.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seven Spirits actually are the one Spirit of God which is sevenfold for God s move to carry out God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As seven is the number for completion in God s operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God s move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In essence and existence, God s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s Spirit is sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Revelation 4:5 says that the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These lamps are the seven lamps of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the tabernacle in the Old Testament, there was a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In existence it was one lampstand, but in function it was seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Revelation tells us that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Based upon this, we may say that the lampstand signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The gold as the nature refers to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The form of the lampstand refers to the Son as the very form.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The seven lamps refer to the Holy Spirit as the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation 5:6 tells us that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ as the Lamb of God for our redemption has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How could a person s eyes be separated from him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Zechariah 4:10 tells us that these seven lamps are the seven eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then Zechariah 3:9 says that these eyes are the seven eyes of the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This stone is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eyes are for observing and searching.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, in Zechariah 3:9 He is prophesied as the stone, which is the topstone 4:7 with seven eyes for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth Rev 5:6 , running to and fro through the whole earth Zech 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>THE SPIRIT THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AS</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Spirit is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God John 7:39; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 22:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Genesis 1:2 says that the Spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 refers to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This verse mentions the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the consummation of the transformed, tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The processed God marries the transformed man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The husband is triune, and the wife is tripartite.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They match each other.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Triune God has been processed, and the tripartite man will have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God was processed by putting on man s nature, and man was transformed by partaking of God s nature.</S>
