   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUB-SECTION ONE EPHESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE POST-APOSTOLIC CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2:1-7 Verse One</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse one: "To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Write."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John was the Lord's secretary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What he wrote down was just the Lord's words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although today we no longer have direct inspirations from the Lord, we should be careful about what we write.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While we are engaged in the work of evangelistic literature, we should first receive from the Lord the word "write."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our works will be worthwhile only when the language and the content are in line with the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The church in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are familiar with terms like "the Anglican Church," "the Roman Catholic Church," "the Greek Orthodox Church," and "the Church of Christ in China," but the Bible is different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It says "the church in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the original language it means the church which is in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those in the church were but part of the people living in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Ephesians were still Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"The church in Ephesus" was only that part of the Ephesians that had believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church was only in Ephesus; it is not an Ephesian church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, men try to establish Chinese churches because they do not understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is only residing in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a product of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This should forever be the church's stand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once the church is joined with the world, it loses its qualifications!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people think that the Lord sent the first letter to Ephesus because the church in Ephesus was the head church of all the churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we cannot see this anywhere in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We never find any man-made terms as "head church" or "mother church" in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church of God is the Body of Christ, composed of individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not composed of many small churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The unit in the Body of Christ is the individual believer and not an individual church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Believers are the members of Christ, being joined to Christ their Head by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No grand-scale union of churches as is found today can be found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, there is no such term as "head church" or "mother church!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have thought that the organization of the church in the Bible was not as complete as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, for us, we dare not add to or subtract from what the Bible has spoken and revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way, "the churches" are the Christians gathered together under God's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These Christians constitute the church of God in each locality, such as the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, in the Bible the church is not just the Body of Christ, but the house of God, that is, God's dwelling place as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is only one Jesus Christ; He does not have many bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, God has only one home.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not have many homes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, a local church is but the representation of the whole church of God in that particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the number, spiritual condition, and other matters differ in different local churches, they are all representations of the one unique Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are faithful in the Lord's service grieve much for the present church organizations and denominations, but unfortunately, they forget that one local church is but the representation of the whole church of God in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have, however, established many different denominational churches in one locality!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From God's point of view there is only one "church in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are no "churches in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to mention another point.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here God shows us that the churches in all the places do not have any name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Christians in Ephesus were merely called the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible only calls each church by the name of the place where it is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no other name.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is denominated because of names.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word denomination in Latin means "a name."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever there is a name, there is a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, we must never have a certain church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can only have a church in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will only say this much concerning the organization and name of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who will follow the Scriptures will receive guidance from this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To those who will not, there is nothing more we can say.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"The church in Ephesus" was a most blessed church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It had Paul, Apollos, Aquila, Priscilla, Timothy, Tychicus, and others working in it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was very advanced in the knowledge and holiness of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul highly recommended them in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord did not send the first letter to Ephesus because it was the head church in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There were other reasons for this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ephesus was the first one to receive the letter, not because it possessed any outstanding characteristic, but because of its heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When Paul wrote to the Ephesians earlier, he spoke of the high position Christians occupy: how they formerly had walked according to the age of the world, according to the operation of Satan, how they were dead in offenses and sins, and how they were made alive together with Christ, raised up together and seated together in the heavenlies in Christ to receive all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is as far as the individual goes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All believers as individuals have received such grace before God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, God's work did not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Through the Holy Spirit He has joined us to Christ to become His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The book of Ephesians shows us the doctrine and position of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the end it brings out the story of Adam and Eve as an illustration to typify the mystery of the union between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This book tells us that "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish" Eph 5:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How glorious such a doctrine is!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How important it is!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course this teaching is for all the saints, but God chose the Ephesian disciples as the foremost recipients.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If the church at that day had not had the power of the Holy Spirit in its life, work, and testimony, it would not have been qualified to receive such a noble message.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The spiritual condition of those in Corinth and Galatia and the Hebrew believers at that time did not allow Paul to convey such teaching to them 1 Cor 3:1-2; Gal 3:1-3; Heb 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Because the Ephesians obtained more special grace from God, they were able to receive this teaching.</S>
