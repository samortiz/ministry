   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No Relationship Limited in a Local Autonomy,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and No Federated Relationship, but a Unique</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Relationship among All the Local Churches in</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Unique and Universal, Organic Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders of each of the local churches should consider what kind of relationship they have with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is their relationship limited to the brothers in their locality, or are they in fellowship with all the churches in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The leading brothers in a certain locality may have private talks with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When another leading brother from another locality comes to join them, they may then stop their talk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the other leading brother joined them, they talked freely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he arrived, they stopped their talk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This leading brother was excluded from their private relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Two churches may be very close to one another geographically, and yet their relationship is separate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two churches may not want to let each other know about their affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is hard to see two elders from two different churches talking freely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not misunderstand what I am trying to say here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not for the federation of the churches, nor am I for their autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am only for the unique and universal fellowship which is for the organic relationship among all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The relationship of every church should be the unique, universal fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this fellowship, the churches should not have anything private, except certain cases of individuals, involving confidential and personal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may say, Don t the churches keep their accounts separately?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Two leading brothers may be talking about their financial situation locally, but when a leading brother from another locality joins them, they may change the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They want to keep their account private.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But our finances are not something that we need to keep secret.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is nothing wrong with a poor local church, which is short of money, fellowshipping with some other churches to let these churches know their need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, how can one church discover the needs of another?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There may be a church which is quite rich, having a large surplus of funds.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this church does not have the liberty to ask concerning another church s needs, how will it be able to help?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The surplus of a local church is not just their surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the surplus of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is altogether right for a rich church to tell the poor churches that they have a surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is also right for the poor churches to tell the rich ones about their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One church may have material surplus, whereas three other churches may be in desperate need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our relationship is only limited to our locality, the Body of Christ suffers greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What I am talking about is not the way of federation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not want to have a federation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way we should take is the way based upon the unique and universal fellowship of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some brothers overseeing a needy church in a certain locality may be too proud to tell the other churches that they are in need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of pride causes separation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is absolutely nothing wrong with this needy church taking the opportunity to fellowship with another local church who has more money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church who has the surplus should consider the need of the needy church as their need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible frequently charges us to take care of those in need.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we care for individuals in this way, should we not care for the churches in the same way?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The churches are not divided or separated, regardless of how far they are from one another geographically.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The churches are one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How good it is that the churches can go on together in oneness!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The churches should not keep matters related to their going on with the Lord private, but as we have mentioned, there are individual cases within a local church that must be kept private.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If someone is in immorality or some sinful situation, this must be a private matter within that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such matters should be kept secret.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To expose the personal matters of others that are shared with us in confidence is unlawful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Medical doctors are not allowed to expose the defects of their patients.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Pastors are not allowed to publicly expose the moral failures of their church members.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is unlawful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A local church is not for condemning people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is for rescuing, recovering, and loving people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church has not been commissioned to condemn people or to arrest people like a police station.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A local church should be a loving organ that loves the sinners, the backsliders, and the fallen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Its function is not to condemn but to rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Galatians 6:1 says that if one among us is overtaken by some sin, we should exercise a spirit of meekness to recover him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A part of the word recover is the word cover.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we are attempting to recover someone, we must cover him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To cover is to protect.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should protect a sinful one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This does not mean, however, that we tolerate the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot tolerate the sin, but we must take care of the sinful matter privately with a view to rescuing the sinning one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no need for other churches to know about this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For the need and going on of the churches, however, there is the need of much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the local churches are one church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is an organic relationship among all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Their relationship is not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The relationship of the churches must be organic according to the divine life and based upon the organic fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we keep this view, we will be saved from many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the first group of apostles was on the earth, the churches were organically one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After a time, however, the churches began to degrade and became divided.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the beginning of the fourth century, in 325 A.D., Constantine called a council at Nicea.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He presided over that council to force all the principal teachers of that day to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, the issue of this kind of endeavor was the formation of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Actually, there is nothing wrong with being catholic in the proper sense.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be catholic is to be universal or all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the proper sense, all the churches should be catholic ; they should be universally one.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The word catholic, however, has been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Catholic Church has created a great hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This hierarchy came out of the erroneous teaching of Ignatius that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Such hierarchy annuls the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should hate such a hierarchical practice.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When the Brethren were raised up, they strongly attacked the hierarchical practice of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Eventually, however, the Brethren became divided over their doctrinal teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>John Nelson Darby was accused of attempting to unify the churches in the way of federation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One teacher, G. H. Lang, in reacting against Darby, taught that every local assembly should be autonomous.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This teaching of autonomy ruined the Brethren, causing division after division.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In relation to the church, the practice of autonomy is wrong, and the practice of federation is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The church is neither federated nor autonomous.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should only care to practice the Body life of the church as the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the Lord s recovery, we do not practice autonomy or federation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We only have a practice based upon the unique and universal fellowship in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The church in one locality should not have the attitude that they have nothing to do with the church in another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have to admit that such an intrinsic realization of the separate, autonomous relationship of the churches has been creeping into and, even to some extent, has been existing in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This realization is intrinsically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The churches should not practice having a separate, autonomous relationship among one another.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is also wrong for the churches to practice a federated relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should practice the unique relationship based upon the unique, universal, fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The organic relationship of the churches is based on the unique and universal fellowship among all the members of the organic Body of Christ cf.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Phil 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This organic relationship is practiced uniquely and universally among all the local churches as the unique, organic Body of Christ the unique church in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The churches should have no relationship limited in a local autonomy, and no federated relationship, but a unique relationship among all the local churches in the unique and universal, organic Body of Christ.</S>
