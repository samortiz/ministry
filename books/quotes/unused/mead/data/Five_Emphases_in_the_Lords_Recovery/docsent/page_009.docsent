   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROPHESYING TO SOW HIMSELF INTO THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ lived as a God-man on this earth for thirty years in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At thirty years of age, He came out to minister, to speak, to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we are His members, we all must prophesy as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His prophesying presents God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we listen to His speaking, we see God; when we accept His speaking, we accept God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through His speaking for three and a half years, the wonderful Triune God, who is altogether organic, was sown into all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They, however, did not have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were ignorant and unconscious of this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The disciples simply thought that He was their Teacher and their Master and that one day He would be the King in the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>James and John were concerned about who would sit on His right and on His left in the kingdom Mark 10:35-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>DYING AN ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The disciples did not know what they were doing or where they were going, but Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, knew.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was going forward boldly to Jerusalem to hand Himself over to the chief priests and scribes to be crucified Matt 20:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they came to arrest Him at Gethsemane, He said, "Whom do you seek?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said to them, I am....When therefore He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground" John 18:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They knew that "I am" was the name of Jehovah Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not have the capacity, the power, the strength, the might, to arrest this One who was Jehovah God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, He handed Himself over to them to accomplish God's will Matt 26:53-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ as the complete God and the perfect man went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, through His death He accomplished a full and eternal redemption Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He terminated all the negative things in the universe, including Satan Heb 2:14; John 12:31 , the world John 12:31 , the old creation Col 1:20 , the old man Rom 6:6 , the flesh Gal 5:24 , the self 2:20 , sin 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3; John 1:29 , sins 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6 , and religion Gal 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, through His death He released the divine life concealed within Him so that this life could be imparted into His believers John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord was on the cross, two substances came out of His pierced side: blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins John 1:29; Heb 9:22 for the purchase of the church Acts 20:28 ; water is for imparting life, dealing with death John 12:24; 3:14-15 for the producing of the church Eph 5:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins, and, on the positive side, to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, it has two aspects: the redeeming aspect and the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The death of Christ is an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BECOMING THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was the only begotten Son of God in incarnation John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, after His death and His resurrection, He became the firstborn Son among many brothers, many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In resurrection He regenerated us, the sinners, to be God's many sons and His many brethren 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now in the divine sonship there are many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The firstborn Son is Jesus Christ, and we are the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatic, organic, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever a person calls on the Lord's name, He comes into this person as the regenerating One to be the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is indwelling us and is now one spirit with us 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is also included in the biography of Christ.</S>
