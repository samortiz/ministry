   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The King of Kings and Lord of Lords Defeating Antichrist</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 19:11-21 we see Christ as the King of kings and Lord of lords defeating Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 11 says, "I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ will be faithful in destroying Antichrist and true in carrying out God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He will judge and fight in righteousness, even judging by fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Christ comes to judge Antichrist, Antichrist will be utterly rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, there will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and judge it in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His judging by fighting will not only be according to righteousness but will also maintain righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the One who defeats Antichrist, Christ is called The Word of God v. 13 . The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Word of God, Christ speaks for God not only by imparting life as grace to God's chosen people but also by executing God's judgment upon Antichrist and his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is righteous and sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is also a God of order and cannot tolerate disorder and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Christ fights against Antichrist, He will declare that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly, that God is over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ's fighting against Antichrist, therefore, will be a powerful speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 19:15 says, "Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus comes to fight against Antichrist, He will simply need to speak a word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the Lord's way of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Undoubtedly, Antichrist will use the most modern weapons, but Christ will defeat him with the sharp sword, the almighty word that proceeds out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 19:16 tells us, "He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fact that this name will be written upon Christ's garment and thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The garment signifies Christ's attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 19:19 speaks of Christ's enemies: "I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ's enemies are the beast, Antichrist undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet , and the kings of the earth and their armies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist Rev 17:12-14 , and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun Rev 19:16; 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Revelation 19:20 and 21 we see Christ's defeat of Antichrist and his armies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone" v. 20 . Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to perish in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the rest will be killed "with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse" v. 21 . This is Christ in the divine administration as the King of kings and the Lord of lords defeating Antichrist.</S>
