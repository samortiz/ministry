[1]  Message One Called into the Fellowship of God s Son
[2]  2:2, 9-10; 5:7-8; 10:4; 15:45b; 1 Pet 2:24 The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle s ministry 1 Cor 2:2: The death of Christ has become God s power to eliminate all the problems in the universe; thus, Christ crucified is God s power to abolish all negative things and carry out His plan 1:23-24: The human way of solving problems is to negotiate, but God s way is to terminate; the best way to solve problems among people is to terminate everyone involved Gal 2:20; cf.
[3]  The crucified Christ is the wisdom of God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us 1 Cor 1:30: Christ became wisdom to us from God to transmit all that He is into our tripartite being for His eternal expression, making us the masterpiece of God for the wise exhibition of all that Christ is Eph 2:10; 3:10: Christ is our righteousness for our past , by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18; 8:10.
[4]  Message Three The Goal of 1 Corinthians Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:10-16; 3:1, 3, 16; 14:32, 37; 4:1 The goal of 1 Corinthians was to motivate the Corinthian believers who were soulish, fleshy, and fleshly to aspire to the growth in life that they might become spiritual men for God s building 2:15; 3:1, 3; 14:32, 37: First Corinthians reveals that a believer may be one of three kinds of men: A believer may be a spiritual man, living in his spirit under the anointing of the Holy Spirit Rom 8:4; Gal 5:25; 1 Cor 15:45b; 6:17: A spiritual man is one who does not behave according to the flesh or act according to the soulish life but lives according to the spirit, that is, his spirit mingled with the Spirit of God; such a man is ruled and controlled by his spirit 2:15.
[5]  for God s Building Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:1-17 God s goal is to have a farm that will grow materials for the building up of His holy temple as His dwelling place 3:6-7, 9, 12, 16-17.
[6]  Message Six The Kingdom Reward and the Universal Headship Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:24-27; 3:10-17;
[7]  1-13: Although we have been redeemed through Christ, delivered out of Satan s bondage, and brought into the revelation of God s economy, we may yet fail to reach the goal of God s calling, that is, to enter into the possession of our good land, Christ Phil 3:12-14 , and enjoy His riches for the kingdom of God that we may be His expression in the present age and participate in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom age Matt 25:21, 23 .
[8]  Christ, the Son of God, as the Head of mankind in His humanity, is under the headship of God the Father for the government of God s kingdom: After God the Father has subjected all things under the feet of Christ as a resurrected man in glory Eph 1:22; Heb 2:7-8 , and after Christ as such a resurrected man has put all enemies under His feet to execute God the Father s subjection of all things to Him, He as the Son of God, along with His delivering of the kingdom back to God the Father, will also subject Himself in His divinity to God, who has subjected all things to Him, the Son in His humanity 1 Cor 15:24-28.
[9]  Message Seven The Lord s Table and the Lord s Supper Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:14-22; 11:17-34 The record regarding spiritual eating in the Bible is a strong indication that God intends to dispense Himself into us by the way of eating Gen 2:9, 16-17; Exo 12:1-11; 16:14-15; Deut 8:7-10; Rev 2:7, 17; 3:20; 22:14: To eat is to contact things outside of us and to receive them into us, with the result that they eventually become our constitution Gen 2:16-17.
[10]  the Means of the Divine Administration Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:12-27 The apostle s dealing with head covering concerns the Head; his dealing with the Lord s supper the Lord s table concerns the Body 11:3, 17-34: Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder.
[11]  The unique mystical Body of Christ is the means for God to carry out His administration Rom 12:4-5; Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 12:12-13, 25, 27; 11:29: The mystical Body of Christ is thoroughly and absolutely related to God s administration; apart from the mystical Body of Christ, God has no means, no way, to carry out His administration.
[12]  for the Building Up of the Church Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 8:1; 12:31b 14:1; 16:24 Love is the most excellent way for the building up of the church, and prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the church 1 Cor 8:1; 12:31b 14:1, 4b, 12: Paul s ultimate concern is the building up of the church, which is the primary thing in God s economy Matt 16:18.
[13]  Message Ten The Excelling Gift for the Building Up of the Church Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24-26, 31-32, 37, 39 Prophesying is the excelling gift produced in the growth in life through the enjoyment of Christ for the building up of the church v. 12; Matt 16:18; 1 Cor 14:4b.
[14]  Phil 1:19; Exo 30:23-25 In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul dealt with the Corinthians heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead; we must see that resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy v. 12: The three major items of the Lord s resurrection are the birth of the firstborn Son of God, the regeneration of the many sons of God, and Christ as the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit; the entire economy of God is carried out by these three items Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Cor 15:45b: The firstborn Son of God is the Head of the Body Col 1:18 , the many sons of God are the members of the Body John 12:24; Rom 8:29 , and the life-giving Spirit is the reality and life of the Body John 14:17; Eph 4:4 . Without these major items of the Lord s resurrection, there would be no church, no Body of Christ, and there would be no economy of God.
[15]  Money and Material Possessions Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 16:1-3; Matt 6:24 Although the material things were created by God and belong to Him 1 Chron 29:14, 16 , they have been corrupted by man s fall and usurped by Satan, the evil one 1 John 5:19 ; hence, they belong to fallen man and are unrighteous Luke 16:9: Man fell into the darkness of acknowledging only material riches and not God, of trusting only in material riches and not in God, and even of serving material riches, taking them as God and allowing them to replace God 1 Tim 6:17.
