[1]  It is hard for you to kick against the goads v. 14 . Paul asked, Who are You, Lord? The Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute v. 15 . Then the Lord told him that He had chosen him to be a minister and a witness both of the things in which he had seen Him and of the things in which He would appear to him.
[2]  After testifying of these things, Paul concluded by saying, Therefore...I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision v. 19 . When Paul was serving God in the Jewish religion, he was serving by tradition, not by vision, but from the day the Lord met him, called him, and chose him on the way to Damascus, he became a man with a vision.
[3]  THROUGH AN OUTLINE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT From Adam to Samuel
[4]  The Old Testament begins with God s creation, or the creation of Adam, and spans four thousand years until the birth of the Lord Jesus.
[5]  Then in Abraham is seen God s calling, God s promise, justification by faith, the living by faith, and the living in fellowship with God.
[6]  If we add up these numbers, we can see one thing: Paul s word in Acts 13 does not take Saul s years into account because at the time he was king, there was a rival, which was David.
[7]  SERVING GOD ACCORDING TO THE VISION OF THE AGE
[8]  We must be clear that in every age there is the vision of that age.
[9]  When we read the record of the Bible, it appears as if Noah s family, including himself, his wife, his three children, and their wives were the only ones who were serving God.
[10]  Can we believe that at that time there were actually only eight people serving God, and the rest were worshipping idols and not serving God?
[11]  How can you negate all the denominations and all the Christians and say that only you have the vision?
[12]  However, if we are clear concerning the vision in the Bible, we will have the confidence to say that we are in fact those who serve by following a vision.
[13]  of Those Who Have the Vision The Example of Aquila and Priscilla
[14]  At the beginning of Acts 18, we are told that through his tentmaking Paul gained a couple, Aquila and Priscilla.
[15]  Immediately they joined Paul in his vision and in his service.
[16]  We see clearly from the revelation of the New Testament that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was acting under the vision.
[17]  Gamaliel was very knowledgeable; he was very familiar with God s principles, but he was not under the vision.
[18]  After the Lord s ascension, it was Peter and his co-workers who were under the vision.
[19]  At the time of Abel, not a single book of the Bible had been written.
[20]  It was fourteen hundred years after Abel, at the time of Moses, that the Pentateuch was completed.
[21]  However, even at the time of Moses, God s revelation was still in the process of development; it was not yet complete.
[22]  The vision that Moses saw was not enough to completely govern those who came after him.
[23]  When we come to the New Testament, we find Paul saying that he became a minister to the church according to the stewardship that God had entrusted to him for the completion of the word of God Col 1:25 .
[24]  The book of Revelation is certainly the ultimate consummation of God s revelation because Paul did not mention anything about the new heavens and the new earth, and Peter mentioned them only briefly 2 Pet 3:13 .
[25]  The Pharisees interrogated Him, and He answered, saying, Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?
[26]  I fully agreed with the Lord s recovery, but during the first seven and a half years I was not in the Lord s recovery but in the Brethren assembly.
[27]  During the past sixty years, according to my observation and based on my knowledge of the Bible, my experience as a Christian, and my study of Christianity s history and its present condition, I can say with full confidence that the Lord s recovery is serving under the vision.
[28]  In the first chapter, entitled Vision in God s Economy, we read how God s servants and the Lord s followers must see a vision.
[29]  In this chapter we will continue with this burden by speaking about the vision of those who serve the Lord.
[30]  According to the revelation of the entire Bible, the Lord began showing men a vision from the time of Adam.
[31]  When Adam was first created, God showed him a clear yet relatively simple vision before he fell; he was placed in front of two trees in the garden of Eden and was told, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die Gen 2:16-17 .
[32]  The time of Enosh was the third generation of mankind.
[33]  The fallen man discovered that he was a frail being, that he was nothing, could do nothing, and had nothing.
[34]  He realized that not only must the fallen man seek covering in God s righteousness through the shedding of the sacrificial blood, and not only must he trust in the coming One for the destruction of the enemy according to His revealed way, but this same fallen man must call on the name of Jehovah out of his vanity, nothingness, destitution, and impotence and live by the enjoyment of God s riches and supply.
[35]  He inherited Adam s vision, Abel s vision, and Enosh s vision, but he went on to see that he could not be separated from God.
[36]  THE VISIONS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Vision of John the Baptist
[37]  At the time the Old Testament era ended, the earthly system of service was still in place.
[38]  In Jerusalem of Judea there was still the temple, and there were still priests offering sacrifices, worshipping, and serving God according to the God-ordained institutions.
[39]  Please tell me who was serving according to a vision at that time: Was it the priests who were abiding by the traditions, or was it John the Baptist who had dropped all the traditions?
[40]  The One whom the disciples followed eventually brought them to the cross.
[41]  They were crucified with Him, died with Him, were buried with Him, and resurrected and ascended with Him Eph 2:6 .
[42]  Formerly, he only identified himself with the vision through the Lord Jesus.
[43]  Here we have to ask, while Paul was fulfilling his ministry, who on earth was clear about God s vision?
[44]  At that time there were still many God-fearing people in the Jewish religion.
[45]  For example, Gamaliel feared God; he understood the Old Testament and was familiar with the teachings of the Old Testament, yet he was not in Paul s vision.
[46]  At the time Paul was fulfilling his ministry, it seems that James and Peter were one with his vision.
[47]  From the time the apostle John completed the book of Revelation until today, nineteen centuries have passed.
[48]  During the past nineteen hundred years, countless numbers of Christians have been serving God.
[49]  In order to serve God according to the up-to-date vision, we need to come up to the level of Paul s very last Epistles.
[50]  Simply put, in order for us to serve God today, our vision must extend all the way from the first vision of Adam in Genesis to the ultimate vision of the manifestation of the church, the New Jerusalem.
[51]  Today as we stand here and ponder the revelations unveiled in the Lord s recovery, as we read the publications that are released among us, we can see that they cover everything from the church to God s economy to the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.
[52]  Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint, because there is no one accord.
[53]  It is true that many people love the Lord and serve God, but everyone has his opinion and his own vision.
[54]  It does not mean that once we have the vision, we do not need to have godliness anymore, yet I hope that you would remember that godliness alone cannot match the vision.
[55]  Paul writes in 1 Timothy 1:3, I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things.
[56]  This verse shows that Paul was inwardly clear that there were some in Ephesus who were teaching differently.
[57]  In order to understand 1 Timothy, we must first understand the background behind the writing of this book.
[58]  In Acts 20 we find Paul sending for the elders of the church in Ephesus while he was on his way to Jerusalem.
[59]  He reminded them how for three years he was in their midst, not shrinking from declaring to them all the counsel of God vv.
[60]  Although Paul tried to become as a Jew to the Jews and as a Gentile to the Gentiles, the Lord did not allow him to compromise.
[61]  In these three books he unveiled God s economy, which concerns God s dispensing of Himself in His Divine Trinity into His chosen people in order that they may gain Christ, who is the Triune God Himself, for the producing of the members of Christ, to be constituted as the organic Body of Christ to be the church of the living God to manifest Him.
[62]  A little more than a year after Paul was released from prison, Nero, the Roman Caesar, began to persecute the Christians.
[63]  As we have already seen, these healthy words are the words of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament and the preaching of the Lord s apostles concerning such things as God becoming flesh and the mystery of godliness.
[64]  After we heard Brother Nee s fellowship, we asked why we should not invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come and visit us, since Brother Nee spoke so highly of him.
[65]  Brother Nee answered in a wise way: The time has not come.
[66]  Recently I have felt the importance of the one accord.
[67]  As long as we have different views on a minor point, we cannot have the one accord.
[68]  This is the reason that in this training, right from the beginning, I spoke concerning the vision in the Lord s recovery.
[69]  I believe all the brothers and sisters love the Lord, and all of us want to be in one accord, but if our vision is not up to date, it is impossible for us to be one.
[70]  In the previous chapter we said that God gave men a vision even in the Old Testament age.
[71]  Throughout the ages there were many saints who loved the Lord and who feared the Lord, but we cannot say that they all had the vision that matched their age.
[72]  I believe Apollos somewhat belongs to this category of people, because Acts 18 says that he was powerful in expounding the Scriptures v. 24 . He knew the Old Testament well, but he did not know the four Gospels; he only knew the baptism of John v. 25b . His vision only went that far.
[73]  After he finished writing concerning the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, God s visions were complete.
[74]  A young brother once said, Brother Nee used to speak of the cross, but we do not speak concerning it anymore.
[75]  By reading the messages on the New Jerusalem, we can see that in order to become the gates of pearl we must pass through the Lord s death.
[76]  Our vision is that God so loved the world that He gave His Son to die for us to redeem us, the sinners, in order that we can have the life of Christ and be regenerated by Him to be God s children, enjoying the riches of the Triune God to become the Body of Christ.
[77]  We are not only following, but we are practicing what we have seen and what we follow, which is the dispensing of the Triune God, the mingling of God and man, to become the Body of Christ to be the manifestation of the Triune God.
[78]  If we are attuned to the Lord s heart, and if we dispense the Triune God to others, imparting to them the Lord s life so that they become His members and are constituted to be His Body as His full expression, then spontaneously we will be in one accord.
