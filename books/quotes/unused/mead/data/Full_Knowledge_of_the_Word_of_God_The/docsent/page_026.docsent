   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING CONCERNED FOR THE FULL-TIME BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am concerned about the more than two hundred full-timers who are here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I care for this matter very much because it is a matter of great importance to me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have graduated from college; you are young and have a great future, yet you have given up everything to trust the Lord and learn to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is of great value, even if there is only one full-timer, not to mention two hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since there are two hundred of you, I feel that I have so much in my heart that I want to do, yet my strength is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would like to be with you all the time for ten years to do nothing else but study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe this would make my heart happy, and I would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would have two hundred disciples to study with me for ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This would be a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, after weighing the situation, I feel that I cannot let this work go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During these few days I have been tossing back and forth, even in my sleep at night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I visited Australia in April of 1971.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time there were no churches in Australia, although there were several churches in New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It has been fourteen and a half years since my last visit, and now there are twelve churches that have been raised up in Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Recently, I received a letter from Australia saying, "Now is the time that you should come."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus there is a turmoil in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although I would only spend a week in Australia, it would make a great difference here whether I go or not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether or not I can spare this one week depends on the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I really would like to stay here to do something with you two hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I also hope that the number of full-time brothers and sisters will increase to five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Five hundred full-time brothers and sisters could be produced on the island of Taiwan each year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the need for my going to Australia, I have to work harder.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the previous messages I spoke on the way to know God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should have more fellowship on the points in those messages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are all basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After that I continued to speak on the five major theological problems that were ignored and misunderstood throughout history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the last message I gave you two major problems: God's economy and God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not believe that you have thoroughly understood the previous message.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I hope that after this week is over, the young people, especially those brothers and sisters who are full-timers, will make an effort to study these two major problems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you study, you need to search out all the books in the Gospel Book Room that are related to God's economy and God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Study together to enter into these two very basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this message I will give you three more topics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first topic is the divine Trinity, that is, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second topic is the God-man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This topic is related to Christ's person, to what is called Christology in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The third topic is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ever since the passing away of the apostles, beginning from the second century, the questions of the Triune God and Christ's person have been the focal points of debates.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These debates have continued even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although there are many inaccuracies in these debates, some of the debaters are scholars who have had very deep insights.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can say that today we inherit what they have seen, and we stand on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the Lord has been merciful to us and has enlightened us during these years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand we inherited something from them, and on the other hand we have been enlightened further.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What I have given you in the outline of this message is a product of what we inherited and what we ourselves have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is very simple and yet very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are still young, and you should not enter into these debates, because once you get into them you will find yourself in a maze that you cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have passed through this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, based on what others have seen through the debates in the past, plus the light that we have received, I have written the crucial points in the outline.</S>
