<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. IN TRUSTING IN GOD FOR HIS PROTECTION<br>AND DELIVERANCE FROM HIS ENEMIES</H2><P>Psalm 27 is the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his trusting in God for His protection and deliverance from his enemies. He spoke much in this psalm about his enemies, and he believed that he would be delivered because he trusted in God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking God as His Light,<br>His Salvation, and the Strength and<br>Stronghold of His Life, So That He Does Not Dread His Adversaries and Enemies</H2><P>David took God as his light, as his salvation, and the strength and stronghold of his life, so that he would not dread his adversaries and enemies (vv. 1-3). The thought in these verses belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In them we again see David's pride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Seeking the Face of God and Asking God<br>Not to Abandon or Forsake Him</H2><P>David also said that he sought the face of God and asked God, the God of his salvation, not to abandon or forsake him, but to take him up more than his father and his mother (vv. 7-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Asking God to Teach Him His Way<br>and Lead Him on a Level Path because of<br>His Enemies Who Lie in Wait for Him</H2><P>David asked God to teach him His way and lead him on a level path because of his enemies who lay in wait for him, having believed that he would see the goodness of God in the land of the living (vv. 11-13).</P><P>We need to see that God did not preserve and deliver David because of his integrity. Instead, God preserved David and delivered him for God's purpose. In the Old Testament economy, God needed a man like David, but David was not a great man of integrity. He was not that pure. God said in 1 Kings 15:5 that David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. David murdered Uriah and robbed him of his wife, Bathsheba. Even the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 records that David begot a son of the wife of Uriah (v. 6). This is not a nice expression. To say that a man begot a son of someone else's wife is a black spot on his record. This shows that David was not absolutely pure and absolutely perfect. He did not have this qualification, and none among us has this qualification. No one except the Lord Jesus has ever walked in an absolutely pure and perfect way. Eventually, due to David's failure, his family became a corrupted mess. Among his children there was also fornication and murder (2 Sam. 13).</P>
