   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The calling which we received from God brings us hope Eph 1:18; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are regenerated to a living hope 1 Pet 1:3, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. Our Christ, who is in us, is the hope of glory Col 1:27; 1 Tim 1:1 , which will issue in the redemption, the transfiguration of our body in glory Rom 8:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the hope of salvation 1 Thes 5:8 , a blessed hope Titus 2:13 , a good hope 2 Thes 2:16 , the hope of eternal life Titus 1:2; 3:7 , which is the hope of the glory of God Rom 5:2 , the hope of the gospel Col 1:23 , the hope which is laid up for us in heaven Col 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should always keep this hope 1 John 3:3 , and boast in it Rom 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our God is the God of hope Rom 15:13 , and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope Rom 15:4 all the time in God 1 Pet 1:21 and rejoice in it Rom 12:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Faith Substantiating the Things</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Which We Are Hoping For</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the things which we are hoping for are substantiated by our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With faith, they all are real; without faith, they seem vain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to contact God for His infusion of faith that we may substantiate all the things which He has promised as our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Faith as the Conviction of Things Not Seen</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 1 also says that faith is the conviction of things not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word rendered conviction may also be translated evidence or proof.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word conviction implies action.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, faith is not the substance, but the conviction, action, evidence, and proof of things not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All things hoped for are things not seen Rom 8:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If anything is seen, we do not need to hope for it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As people of hope, we should not aim our life at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal 2 Cor 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we walk by faith, not by sight 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are aiming at the Holy of Holies and the New Jerusalem, neither of which can be seen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, we have the full conviction of these unseen things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Faith assures us of the things not seen, convincing us of what we do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, it is the evidence, the proof, of things unseen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Faith, which is the way to realize and enjoy the things of God, is not a part of our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a divine ability which has been infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The proper faith is the divine element, even God Himself, infused into our being as the ability to substantiate the things which we do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This infused element is our substantiating ability.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we contact God or listen to His word, the substantiating ability which has been infused into our being by God Himself spontaneously begins to realize the things of God, the things hoped for, and the things not seen, and we simply believe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we have seen, faith is a special sense in addition to the five senses derived from our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This sense substantiates the things of God, things which we do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since the Christian life is a life of hope and in this life we aim at things unseen, we need more of the transfusion and infusion of God that we may have the ability, the faith, to substantiate the things hoped for and to have the conviction of things unseen.</S>
