   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST AS THE CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S MOVE ON THE EARTH 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 68:18-35</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 68 has two main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 1 through 18 are the first section, and verses 19 through 35 are the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we will see, each section has a center.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we explain what is the center of the first section, let us consider once again the matter of God's move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the entire universe, God has only one move.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Old Testament time was actually not a time for God to move on the earth but rather a time of preparation for His move.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's activities from Genesis to Malachi were all a part of this preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As an illustration, we may consider the preparation that is necessary for opening a store.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The store may be built and furnished and yet not be open for business.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the preparations have been made, but the owner of the store has not yet started his business.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a similar way, the Old Testament time was a time of God's preparation for opening the "business" of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's economy is mainly to work Himself into His chosen and redeemed people in order to make Himself one with them and to make them one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His economy God even mingles Himself with His people to be one entity with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning this, the Bible says that we who are joined to the Lord are one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the Spirit; He has made a spirit within us; and now the divine Spirit and the regenerated human spirit have been mingled together to be one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a mingling did not take place in the Old Testament, for the Old Testament time was the time of God's preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He prepared the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man with a spirit for God Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way, man was prepared by God for the carrying out of the business of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God took about two thousand years the period of time from Abraham to the coming of Christ to prepare the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider all the work God did with Israel throughout the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Beginning with Abraham in Genesis and continuing to the end of Malachi, God engaged in many activities to make everything ready for Him to carry out His economy.</S>
