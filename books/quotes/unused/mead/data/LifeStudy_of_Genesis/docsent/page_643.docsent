   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We all have received the first garment, and there is no problem regarding our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are saved and we shall spend eternity with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is more certain than a policy from the most trustworthy insurance company.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But what about the second garment?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot at the present time be as certain of this as we are of the first garment, for we may not have paid the necessary premium for this second policy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to gain the second garment so that we may receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord that both the objective garment and the subjective garment are gifts!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both have been given by the Father to the Son, and the Son has given them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you asked me if I have these two garments, I would answer, "I certainly have the first garment, and the second garment is within me and it is in the process of coming out."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You also have received the second garment and have it within you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now you need to pray, "Lord Jesus, process Yourself out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord Jesus, come out of me to be my second garment."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all need this garment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Related to the second garment is the third item, the golden chain placed around Joseph's neck.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible a chained neck signifies a subdued will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the children of Israel were disobedient, the Lord referred to them as a stiff-necked people Exo 32:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would be very uncomely for a person with a stiff neck to wear a golden chain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would be beautiful, however, to see a golden chain on a neck that is bowed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The chained neck signifies a will that has been conquered and subdued to obey God's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When your neck has been conquered and subdued in this way, it is chained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever seen a woman wearing a necklace while quarreling with her husband?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I saw this, I said to myself, "You should take off that necklace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since you are being stiff-necked, you should not be wearing a necklace."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even a man's necktie is a type of chain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is an amount of refinement related to wearing such a chain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The golden chain on the neck signifies the Spirit for obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Acts 5:32 says that the Spirit is given to those who obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the Spirit is given not only as a gift for salvation, but also for obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How I admire the sequence of the things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I had listed the gifts given to Joseph, I would have mentioned the ring first, then the chain, and finally the garments.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was young, I was bothered by the fact that the garments are mentioned before the golden chain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the sequence of the three gifts in verse 42 is according to the spiritual sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the spiritual sequence we firstly receive the Spirit for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we receive the garment of righteousness, and we begin to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to live out Christ, we need to have a chain on our neck.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that our neck must be conquered, subdued, and chained by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, the Holy Spirit will chain you!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It will chain your stiff neck and cause it to be soft and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many saints in the church life have had their necks chained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is even true of some of the teenagers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was a teenager, I had a stiff neck.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although my mother loved me very much, my neck was still very stiff.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of you teenagers are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, when you call on the Lord Jesus, you are spontaneously chained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord puts His chain on your neck, and your neck is softened and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes your disposition may cause you to be unhappy with your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, because your neck has been chained, it is no longer as stiff as it used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When your neck was so stiff, there was no chain on it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But today you have been chained by the Holy Spirit, chained by the Spirit for obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, others can see on your neck the beauty of the Holy Spirit for obedience expressed in your submission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have been subdued, and you are submissive to your mother and father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Someone may say, "When I am eighteen years of age, I will have my freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not the testimony of a person chained with a golden chain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One who has a chain on his neck is submissive to his parents and to his teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When your neck is chained, it bears a certain type of beauty, the golden beauty of the Spirit for obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These are the gifts received by our Joseph and passed on to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I can boast that on my hand I have a ring, that around my entire being I have a robe, and that another robe is coming out from within me along with the golden chain around my neck.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah, Christ has received gifts and He has passed all these gifts on to me!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now I also have received gifts in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All this is typified by Joseph.</S>
