   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OVERCOMING IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me give you a suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose you have a besetting sin which you cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have been trying and trying to overcome, yet you fail again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I suggest that you bring your failure, your problem, to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You will see right away that the victory is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes you may say that it is hard for you to be clear about the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if you would bring the matter to the Body and fellowship with the Body, you would be clear about the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you desire to have a sanctified life?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just bring yourself to the Body, and you will see that you have been sanctified already.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is easy for you to realize the fullness of Christ's being life to you if you put yourself in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The isolated members are the poorest members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you simply abide in the Body, all the fullness of the Body will be yours to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes people have asked me, "Brother Lee, how do you study the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How many hours and days have you spent in the Word so that you are able to receive this kind of light?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times I wish to answer, "I spend just a little time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I read the Word in the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One time I traveled to a certain place and ministered to the saints there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After a meeting, someone asked the brothers from which seminary I had graduated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I wish to let you know that I study in the "seminary" of the Body, and I have not graduated yet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am still in the "university of the Body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is my only university, and this is my only seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day by day I learn something not only from the Bible and through the Bible but also from all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another time, after I finished ministering to the saints in a certain locality, a brother came up to me, saying, "Brother Lee, we thank you for your ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I replied, "Brother, I thank you for your being here."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because in the Body we learn more and more about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just bring yourselves to the Body, and you will see where you are and how wonderful, how rich, and how full the blessing and the experience of Christ can be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these days, let us seek the Lord by praying in this way, "Lord, now I realize that Your central thought is the church for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Teach me the proper way to practice the church life."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that you would pray much for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE WHEEL OF GOD'S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In conclusion, I would like to point out that in Ezekiel chapter one there are the wheels vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These wheels represent the activity, the move, of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today the wheels are the churches with Christ as their hub.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the hub and the churches are the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without Christ, there is no center.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But without the church, there is no circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without Christ, there is no hub; without the church, there is no rim.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A wheel needs both the hub and the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this universe, with the wheel of God's move, God's activity, there is the need of the church as the rim to match Christ as the hub.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we have Christ as the center and the church as the rim, we will have the wheel of God moving all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One may have the strongest and the most beautiful hub, but if there is no rim, there is no wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us pray for God's move today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God needs to move on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the divine move, there is the need of a hub, which is Christ Himself, and there is also the need of a rim, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have both the hub and the rim, then you have a wheel rolling on for God's move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may see these things in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is the hub, and the church is the rim.</S>
