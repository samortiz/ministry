   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON EIGHT MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We will now consider five aspects of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD S ORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has ordained a way of existence for every living creature in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s ordination for a creature is the law of existence for that creature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fulfilling this law enables a creature to survive and be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a creature does not follow this law, it violates God s ordination and thus suffers unnecessary loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has ordained that chickens live on land, not in water; thus, chickens cannot live in water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has also ordained that ducks live in water, so ducks cannot stay away from water for long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, birds must be in the air and fish in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These ordinations are the law of existence for these creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has also ordained that Christians must meet in order to live or survive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To Christians, meeting is like water to fish or air to birds.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as fish need to live in water and birds need to live in the air, Christians need to maintain their life by meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a Christian stops meeting, he is like a fish out of water or a bird that is not in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has no way to survive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers and sisters, once we are saved, we are a person in the church, and we cannot be individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be a Christian, we must be one in the assembly, and this assembly is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meaning of the term church is the gathering of the called-out ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This implies that the nature of the church involves meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without meeting, the church cannot exist, and there will be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life of the church hinges on meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the church is intimately related to meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be deeply impressed with this point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Originally, we were descendants of Adam living in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God called and saved us and we answered His call, He immediately set us apart from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God does not desire for us to be individual Christians after we have been set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, He desires to gather all of the called ones into an assembly, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we cannot say that meeting alone constitutes the church, we can say that the church is in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Christians did not meet, it would be difficult to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Deciding not to meet is almost the same as prohibiting Christians to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we stop meeting, we are separated from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not attend the meetings, we are detached from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The need to meet is according to God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to meet just as fish need water, birds need air, and man needs to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is God s ordination, and it should never be violated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE REQUIREMENT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every kind of life has its own characteristic or characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spiritual life that we obtained, the life of God in us, has many different characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Staying away from sin and abhorring sin is a characteristic of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Desiring to draw near to God and to serve God are also characteristics of the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Flocking together, that is, assembling, is another characteristic of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The life within us wants us to flock together with other believers, to assemble with others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This characteristic demands that we be joined to others instead of being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our physical life depends upon drinking water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not drink water, we will be thirsty, but we feel comfortable when we drink water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Similarly, the spiritual life within us has the characteristic of wanting to meet with other Christians, of wanting to flock together with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the New Testament, the word flock is the same as assembly .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus said, I have other sheep...I must lead them also...there shall be one flock John 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The flock is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A shepherd knows that sheep do not like to be isolated; they like to flock together with other sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sheep do not like to roam about in the mountains and fields on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a suffering and unpleasant experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, sheep feel comfortable and at ease when they are in a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christians are the Lord s sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The sheep s life in us demands that we flock together and assemble.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a new believer does not come to the meetings, he will not have much joy, peace, or comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If he comes to the meetings, however, he will have joy within as he sings, fellowships, prays, praises, and worships with the brothers since this is a characteristic of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christian meetings are the issue of this inward requirement of life.</S>
