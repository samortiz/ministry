   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE FIRST TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SALVATION AND CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GIVEN ON OCTOBER 18, 1936 Scripture Reading: Acts 26:29; Gal 1:15 FAMILY BACKGROUND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was the third child preceded by two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because I had an aunt who had borne six daughters in succession, my paternal aunt was displeased when my mother bore two girls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Chinese custom, males are preferred over females.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When my mother gave birth to two girls, people said she would probably be like my aunt, bearing half a dozen girls before bringing forth a boy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though at that time my mother was not clearly saved, she knew how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So she spoke to the Lord, saying, "If I have a boy, I will present him to You."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord heard her prayer and I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My father told me, "Before you were born, your mother promised to present you to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SAVED AND CALLED AT THE SAME TIME</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was saved in 1920 at the age of seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before being saved I experienced some mental conflict concerning whether or not to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior and whether or not to become the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For most people, the problem at the time of salvation is how to be delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But for me, being saved from sin and my life career were linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I were to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior, I would simultaneously accept Him as my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He would deliver me not only from sin but also from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I was afraid of being saved, for I knew that once I was saved I must serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of necessity, therefore, my salvation would be a dual salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was impossible for me to set aside the Lord's calling and to desire only salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I had to choose either to believe in the Lord and have a dual salvation or forfeit both.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For me to accept the Lord would mean that both events would take place simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FINAL DECISION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the evening of April 29, 1920, I was alone in my room.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had no peace of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether I sat or reclined, I could find no rest, for within was this problem of whether or not I should believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My first inclination was not to believe in the Lord Jesus and not to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, that made me inwardly uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was a real struggle within me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At first I had no words with which to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But eventually many sins came before me, and I realized that I was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I had never had such an experience in my life before that time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I saw myself as a sinner and I also saw the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I saw the filthiness of sin and I also saw the efficacy of the Lord's precious blood cleansing me and making me white as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I saw the Lord's hands nailed to the cross, and at the same time I saw Him stretching forth His arms to welcome me, saying, "I am here waiting to receive you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Overwhelmed by such love, I could not possibly reject it, and I decided to accept Him as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Previously, I had laughed at those who believed in the Lord, but that evening I could not laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, I wept and confessed my sins, seeking the Lord's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After making my confession, the burden of sins was discharged, and I felt buoyant and full of inward joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the first time in my life that I knew I was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I prayed for the first time and had my first experience of joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There might have been some joy and peace before, but the experience after my salvation was very real.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Alone in my room that evening, I saw the light and lost all consciousness of my surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I said to the Lord, "Lord, You have really been gracious to me."</S>
