<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:19-51</h1>
<p>We will now look at John 1:19-51, beginning with the matter of the Lamb and the dove.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GENERAL IDEA OF THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>From the introduction of the Gospel of John we know that the Lord Jesus is the Word of God. Before the beginning of time in eternity past, the Word of God, the explanation of God, existed. At the beginning of time He created all things, and then at a certain point in time, He came among men to be life to man. His life is the light of man, and this light shines in the darkness. Although some reject the light, others receive it, obtaining God Himself and being given the authority to become children of God. Those who receive Him are not only created by God but also born of God. As such, they can receive God as grace, touch God as reality, and enjoy God&rsquo;s fullness. The unfathomable and unapproachable God has been declared to man through the Word in order to be received, mingled, enjoyed, and experienced practically.</p>
<p>God created man and came to be man&rsquo;s life so that man may be born of God to enjoy Him as grace and reality and also to enjoy His fullness. The end result of this enjoyment is His tabernacling in man and among man. Thus, the unfathomable and unapproachable God can dwell among man and in man. This dwelling also speaks of God and man being mingled together; that is, of the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among men.</p>
<p>This revelation is not according to man&rsquo;s natural concept, and it is apart from revelation. This is something that has not come up in man&rsquo;s heart (1 Cor. 2:9). This is also not a matter that man can easily receive because the thought of God being the Word not only to create all things but also to enter into created man is not something that has ever come up in our natural thought. The matters of being mingled with God by receiving Him, of enjoying His fullness, and of becoming the tabernacle of God on earth also have not come up in our heart. Nevertheless, these matters are presented in the introduction to the Gospel of John. The introduction is an outline, a brief explanation, of the entire book. We need to speak of these matters repeatedly because they are not according to our human concepts.</p>
<p>After the introduction, John presents many details that support these points. The first detail relates to the testimony of John the Baptist concerning the Lord Jesus; his description of the Lord is unique, and it matches the unique writing style of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE WRITING STYLE OF<br />
THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>Careful readers of the Bible all acknowledge that the Gospel of John is written in a unique way. Whenever John speaks of a particular incident, he presents the background and context of the case before he introduces the central figure. For example, in chapter 4 the Lord Jesus and His disciples were wearied from their journey, and they were hungry and thirsty. With this as the background, the Lord stopped at a well, met a woman who had come to draw water, and asked the woman for a drink. The background is one of hunger and thirst, and the context is entirely about water. With this background and context, John portrays the Lord Jesus as the One who is able to supply living water to quench people&rsquo;s thirst forever.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the Lord Jesus caused a weak and dying person to be enlivened and strengthened. In order to describe this incident, John presents a background that references many elements in Judaism, including feasts, the city of Jerusalem, angels, and the Sabbath (vv. 1-4, 9). In such a religious atmosphere, the immediate context included a multitude of sick people. This multitude was not a group of happy people who were walking, standing, and singing; rather, they were dying. Consequently, they were lying and waiting for an angel to come and stir up the water in the pool in the hope that they could be the first to step into the pool and be healed (v. 4). Even though they adhered to the letter of religion, their weaknesses could not be healed. This is a sign of death. When the Lord Jesus saw a man who had been sick for thirty-eight years lying by the pool, He asked, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The man said, &ldquo;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me&rdquo; (v. 7). Religion seemingly has a means to heal, but he did not have the strength to receive any healing. In such a situation of despair, the Lord Jesus manifested Himself as the Lord who can turn weakness to strength and death to life.</p>
<p>In every case in the Gospel of John, there is always a description of the background and then a specific context related to the background in order to show what the Lord is and how His life can overcome the background and subdue the environment. His ability to overcome the background and subdue the environment shows how His life, which cannot be limited or restrained, meets every need and solves every problem. This is the unique writing style of the Gospel of John.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
