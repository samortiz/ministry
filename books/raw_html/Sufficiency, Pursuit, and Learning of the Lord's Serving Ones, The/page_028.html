         <h2 class="head2">The Problems of Our Mind</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Studying the Meaning of Words and Allegories</h2>
<p>Besides the problems related to our heart, we must also deal with the problems related to our mind. The first problem related to our mind is that we do not have adequate education. In a previous example we said that it is difficult for a believer who is illiterate to touch the Spirit in the Bible. One way for him to be delivered from illiteracy is to ask someone to read the Bible to him. However, this might not be the best way.</p>
<p>We must understand the meaning of the words used in the Bible. We should understand not only the Bible in Chinese but also numerous portions of the text in Hebrew and Greek. This understanding will help us to receive inspiration. The Chinese Union Version is a good translation, but in several places it needs to be improved because the meaning of the original text is not clear. It is difficult to translate the Bible. Even the books of poetry, such as the Psalms, are very difficult to translate. Hence, if we can understand the text in the original language, we will receive help. If we cannot understand what we read, we will not understand the sense in our spirit. The sense in our spirit passes through the understanding in our mind. If the sense cannot be interpreted in our mind, we cannot understand the sense.</p>
<p>In order to understand the Bible and touch the Spirit, we must spend time to study the words used in the Bible. I often use dictionaries and reference books. I have more than twenty reference books that I use to understand the meaning of a word. Although I do not know Greek well, I can consult reference books. One reference book focuses on how a particular word is used. Another book covers the common roots of a word and how it is derived. Still another reference book shows how a particular word was used in its historical setting or what its meaning was in a legal sense. Furthermore, a reference book may also say how many times a word is used in the New Testament and how it is translated in various places. Another reference book might speak of the spiritual meaning of a word in the Bible. We must spend an adequate amount of time to study these matters.</p>
<p>It is not possible for us to study every word used in the Bible in this way, but we must make an effort to study the crucial words so that we understand the deeper meaning and touch the Spirit. For example, the word <em>expiation</em> is used in the Old Testament (Exo. 29:33; 32:30; Lev. 1:4; 4:31; 5:16; 16:6). In the Chinese Union Version this word is translated as &ldquo;atonement.&rdquo; A believer who has not studied this word may think that since we committed sins and offended God, we need to pay a price to atone for our sins. However, if we study the word, we will discover that the root of this word in Hebrew means &ldquo;to cover.&rdquo; Hence, it is better to understand this word as &ldquo;sin-covering.&rdquo; The expiation, the covering of sins, accomplished through the sacrifices in the Old Testament points to the redemption accomplished by Christ in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The words <em>created</em> (Gen. 1:1; 2:4) and <em>formed</em> (v. 7) have different meanings. The words <em>righteousness, love</em>, and <em>mercy</em> also need to be studied in depth. If we understand the meaning of these words in the original text, the Bible will become a new book to us. The meaning of the Bible is conveyed in its words and depends on our understanding. If we do not understand a word, we cannot obtain a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Here is another example. The New Testament uses at least three different words in Greek for the word <em>life.</em> One word, <em>bios,</em> refers to the physical life; the second word, <em>psuche,</em> refers to the soul-life; and the third word, <em>zoe,</em> refers to God&rsquo;s eternal life. There is a great difference in the meaning of these three words. We must devote adequate time to study such matters. The purpose of studying is to train our mind. If our mind is not properly trained, we cannot receive proper inspiration. The education of our mind is related to studying the words in the Bible.</p>
<p>Another matter that requires understanding is allegories. In order to properly read the Bible, we must use our spirit to touch the Spirit, and we must study the allegories in the Bible. For example, the book of Numbers concerns the Israelites&rsquo; being formed into an army, while the book of Deuteronomy concerns their daily living. In addition to understanding the words and phrases in the Bible, we also need to understand the allegories. We may understand the word <em>tithe</em> but not understand its allegorical usage or know that there are three kinds of tithe (Num. 18:21; Deut. 12:5-7; 14:28-29). If we do not understand the allegories in the Bible, we will not have a deeper understanding, nor will we receive much inspiration concerning these matters. If we understand the allegories in the Bible, we will understand the sense in our spirit when we contact the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>In order to receive the full benefit from the Bible, we must study the allegories in the Bible and contact the Spirit. This can be likened to a feast. On the one hand, we must not only obtain produce but also cook it. On the other hand, we also need to eat. When we touch the Bible, we eat God&rsquo;s words. If we are lazy and are not willing to rise early in the morning, that is, to purchase produce, we will have nothing to prepare, and our meal will consist of &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; and &ldquo;water.&rdquo; This shows that our problem is not a matter of eating but of preparing the food.</p>
<p>We must touch the Spirit with our spirit when we read the Bible. However, the question is whether we regularly study the Word. If we do not study, we will be confused when reading the genealogy in Matthew 1. We will not receive inspiration when we read verse 2. There is a pamphlet entitled <em>The Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> If we are willing to spend half a day to study this pamphlet and to read verses 1 through 17, we will understand the genealogy. Then when we contact Matthew 1 with our spirit, we will receive inspiration. If we spend time to &ldquo;cook&rdquo; in this way, we will enjoy reading the Bible. The pamphlet <em>The Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ</em> gives the spiritual significance of the genealogy of Christ.</p>
<p>When some saints read Exodus or Deuteronomy, they might not have received inspiration from phrases such as <em>the firstborn among the animals...whether it is an ox or a sheep</em> (Lev. 27:26), <em>give a tenth</em> (Deut. 14:22), or <em>the place which Jehovah your God will choose...to put His name</em> (12:5), because they were not educated concerning the allegories in the Bible. If they are willing to spend three to four months and to study Exodus according to this fellowship, they will be enlightened and nourished when they read it. If we are willing to study the Bible in this way, we will receive inspiration no matter what portion we read. This shows that we are educated not only concerning the meaning of words but also concerning the allegories.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must read the Bible and study the Bible; we need to be taught. If we do not understand the meaning of a chemical formula, we need to be taught in order to understand the many symbols and formulas. On the one hand, the Bible is simple, but on the other hand, it is a specialized book, which cannot be understood by a casual reader. We must be trained in the deeper meaning of the Bible. If we do not receive adequate education, we will not receive much inspiration when reading the Bible, and it will not be easy for our spirit to touch the Spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
