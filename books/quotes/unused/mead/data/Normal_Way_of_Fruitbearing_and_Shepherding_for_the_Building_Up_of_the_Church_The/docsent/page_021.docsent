   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REAPING THE SEED OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT HAS BEEN SOWN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sequence of the writing in the Bible is truly meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While the Samaritan woman went away to testify, Jesus disciples came to care for His hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that point, however, He began to care for them by speaking to them about reaping the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He told them, Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor John 4:35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sowing of the field of Samaria began with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Samaritans were descendants of a mixture of the Jewish people with others who had settled in that region.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Around 700 B.C., the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria 2 Kings 17:6, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From that time, because the Samaritans became a people of mixed heathen and Jewish blood, they were never recognized by the Jews as being part of the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, history shows that the Samaritans had the Pentateuch the five books of Moses and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was in this way that the seed was sown in the field of Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the least, they knew some of the things concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s word concerning worshipping God the Father in spirit and in truthfulness is difficult for many to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Samaritan woman, however, had a basis to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the ancient time, the people worshipped God with sacrifices and offerings according to the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Samaritans went to the mountain in Samaria to worship, and the Jews went up to Jerusalem to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus told the woman, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him John 4:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord seemed to be saying, The true worship of God is not in a place but in your spirit and not with offerings but in truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The offerings were a shadow, but I am the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now you need to worship God in your spirit and with Me as the reality of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s word indicates that the Samaritans were not heathens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They had heard a certain amount of the truth because the gospel had been preached to them in part.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the seed had been sown among them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why Jesus told His disciples that others had already sown and that now the field was ripe for harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The proper preaching of the gospel is not a matter of revival or of Pentecostal miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is something normal under God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can apply this principle to our situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Almost everyone in the United States has heard the gospel to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this sense, we do not need to sow the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The seed was sown over the previous centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we need to do a normal job of going out to reap.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the Lord Jesus passed through Samaria to gain that woman, He did not tell His disciples, There are some persons here selected and predestinated by My Father; thus, I am going to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us go together in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As I preach, you must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus was not this religious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible simply says, He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And He had to pass through Samaria vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did not announce or promote what He was doing, and He did not even ask anyone to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He only made a short trip, and on the way He preached.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this sense, He was not like a traditional evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He simply ministered life to people, not sowing the seed but reaping the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In chapter 3 He reaped one man, and in chapter 4 He reaped one woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>TAKING THE LORD JESUS AS OUR EXAMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>TO LIVE THE LIFE OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must all be burdened to go to the Lord and be built up in this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not need to pray and fast for a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we all need to see what the proper, normal gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is that which the Lord Jesus carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He spent time to gain one man and spent some more time to gain one woman.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He reaped not in large numbers but one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, He did not promote His preaching of the gospel and ask people to pray for a special activity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, He simply lived the life of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Wherever He went, the gospel was His living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May we have the genuine recovery of the preaching of the gospel in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After reading church history, I have no confidence in so-called revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should take the Lord Jesus as our example to be interested in imparting life and in helping others to be reborn and to drink the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the normal, daily preaching according to life, not according to miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus sovereignly and wisely used the illustration of a harvest to portray the proper preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A harvest cannot be prepared overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A harvest comes about through tilling the ground, sowing, watering, and caring for the crop for a certain amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First, the ground should be tilled and the seed sown.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After this, it should be watered and cared for, and finally the harvest will come.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a matter not of miracles but of a process in life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is not right to expect a great revival that suddenly brings in a thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should awake from this kind of dream, realize what the proper gospel life is, and live it out in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Wherever we are, the gospel is with us, because it is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without the living of the gospel, the church life is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must all learn the example of the Lord Jesus.</S>
