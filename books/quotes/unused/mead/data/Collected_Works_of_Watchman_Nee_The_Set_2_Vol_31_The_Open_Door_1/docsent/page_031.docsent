   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Brother Chen Jeng-fan, Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received the letters you sent me, as well as The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I will be able to distribute the latter to the brothers in a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the book arrived, I read it in one sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The content is very fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My spiritual eyes and ears were renewed, and I learned more about the standard of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May all the glory go to the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gospel work continues as usual, and the number who believe and receive increases daily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We had a Bible-study conference a month ago and many attended.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We feel that our meeting place is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some brothers have suggested that we expand our gospel preaching place to the area in front of the big temple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are already moving this way, but we are still praying and do not know whether it will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord willing, I will go to Kutien around the Chinese New Year to have some meetings because they have recently rented a larger hall there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can probably use it to gather all the believers in the whole county there for a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please do not forget to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The situation in Foochow is still quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the brothers are living and working in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord be merciful that my life would become a greater testimony to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please pray much for me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I also hope to receive your letters often.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peace to you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your weak brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Chen Jeng-fan</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A Letter from Brother James Chen, Swatow</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Greetings to my beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I think you published my last letter describing something of the condition here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would like to give you the latest report to dispel your concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On December 18 I received the Lord's marvelous leading through a brother's introduction to do some work in Jieh-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Two brothers and one sister went with me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First we preached the gospel for six days in the West Gate Chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there were not many people, the spirit of the meeting was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We had the Lord's presence, and He worked with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later we were invited to the North Gate Chapel to preach the gospel, and we continued speaking for eight days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must thank and praise the Lord for the door He has opened and the work He has started!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regrettably, our work did not give the Holy Spirit the complete freedom to express His power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this we feel remorseful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord have mercy on me and perfect me more each day so that I would become a useful vessel to Him, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In my work I have experienced something from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was very weak physically and spent most of the time lying down, except when I was preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I did not even walk much because I felt as if I would fall down whenever I began to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to my physical condition, it did not seem that I could preach the gospel for two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I thought that since the Lord had opened the door, it was an opportunity that could not be missed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, I believed that the Lord's grace was sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's grace is perfected in weakness, so I continued by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord, His word is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every time I stood up to speak, His power covered me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once I stepped down, I was a sick man again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During this period of time I experienced the words: "Death operates in us, but life in you" 2 Cor 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now there are many places that have invited us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not lacking in opportunity, but we do not have the spiritual content and power to grasp the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the political condition does not change, I really want to go to many more places.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I also hope that the Lord would raise up His testimony in the region of Chaochow and Mei County.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Chen Wen-kwang has an illness of the throat; he is taking a vacation and has returned home to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to man's view, it seems as if this region temporarily has lost a brother who can bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the Lord always has His good will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Elijah thought that he was the only one left among the prophets of Israel, but God still had seven thousand on His side, one of whom was Elisha.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we do not need to fear when Elijah is raptured; our only fear is that Elisha would not be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The brothers and sisters here are all in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everything is normal, so be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peace!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>James Chen</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>January 7</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Address omitted</S>
