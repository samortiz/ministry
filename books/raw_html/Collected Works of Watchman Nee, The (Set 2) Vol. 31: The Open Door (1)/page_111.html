<h2 class="head1">TWO LETTERS RECEIVED<br />AFTER THIS ISSUE WAS EDITED</h2><h2 class="head2">One</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>I read this month's issue of The Open Door and realized that the brothers and sisters in the Lord wanted to know where my younger brother, Tang Shing (Brother Tang Shou-ling) is. Thank the God who loves us. Through believing in His name, we have been given authority to be the children of God. This is why all the brothers and sisters in the Lord care about my brother as if he were their own flesh brother. Last night after dinner, I received a copy of the Weekly Newsletter of the Chinese Methodist Church from my cousin. In it I learned that my brother and his family are all at 228 Mo-Gan-Shan. Mr. Sun Wen-yuan and his family are at No. 254 of the same place. Praise the Lord. He is trustworthy. He really is our keeper, as it says in Psalm 121. When I did not know where my brother was for several months, Proverbs 14:26 really comforted my heart: "In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge." Every time I was discouraged and worried about my brother, the Lord comforted me with that verse. Hallelujah! His Word is faithful! Even though the post office in Mo-Gan-Shan is not reachable, there are no barriers of time and space in the fellowship of the Lord. I believe that what the Lord has arranged for us is more perfect than anything we could dream of. I also believe that soon the brothers and sisters near Mo-Gan-Shan will be able to visit and comfort my brother. Please pray for them much so that they would love the Lord faithfully and glorify His holy name. Please pray for me so that my faith would increase and so that I would not cause the Lord to sadly say, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Ma Tang Mei-jen<br />March 29</p><p>(This letter is from Brother Tang Shou-ling's elder sister. She used to live in Shansi and is now in Ch'ang-sha. We were not only comforted by this letter but were also helped.)</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>X in the Lord:</p><p>Both transportation and the post office have been blocked, so the brothers and sisters in Pu-Dong do not have any exchange of news with the brothers and sisters in Shanghai or the other localities. We were cared for by the Lord and safely arrived in Shanghai. We found out that the brothers and sisters in the Lord were worried about us. This inspired us to thank the Lord's love for its length, breadth, height, and depth. The brothers and sisters in Nan-Chiao and Chi- Hsien-Chiao all suffered the loss of property in this war, but their bodies and spirits were preserved by the Lord without harm. God heard the prayers of the brothers and sisters. Our hearts are full of thanks for the Lord's boundless grace! We are remitting X dollars donated by Brother Yang. X dollars of it are for printing The Open Door. X dollars are to be given to the brothers and sisters who are in difficulty because of the war. Peace in the Lord. Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord. Please pray for Brother Chuang Shu-lian's and Brother Chuang Jeng-yi's families because all are not saved.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chu En-sheng, Chuang Jeng-yi<br />March 19</p><p>(This letter was mailed from Shanghai to Hankow.)</p>
