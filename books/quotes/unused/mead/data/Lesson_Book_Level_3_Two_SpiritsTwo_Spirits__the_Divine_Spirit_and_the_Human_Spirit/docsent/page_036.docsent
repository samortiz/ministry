   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PLEDGING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the anointing, 2 Corinthians 1 mentions the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Along with the anointing and sealing is the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. A Sample and a Foretaste</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In ancient times, the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, was also a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word for "pledge" is somewhat equal to today's down payment, which indicates good faith and is a guarantee of coming payments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Pledge, earnest, and guarantee all these words are about the same in meaning, all referring to a payment that guarantees the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Greek word in addition signifies a sample, a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some translators prefer the word "foretaste."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By enjoying the sample we have a foretaste of what is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose someone gives me ten peaches from his peach orchard.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These peaches are a sample and a foretaste of the produce of the whole orchard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time the Holy Spirit is also a sample and a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The foretaste gives us a taste of God; the full taste is yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. Given for Our Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The pledging of the Spirit is given for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever I am disappointed or depressed, the pledging comes in to uplift me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I experience this pledging daily, even hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Pledging also means that something is given to us as a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the Spirit's pledging, we are encouraged and stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we feel that the situation is hopeless, the pledging fills us with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Probably in your whole Christian life you have never heard a message on the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to my experience, the Holy Spirit is constantly pledging within me, giving me more of God and more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more I receive of Christ, the more my appetite for Him increases.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may admit that they do not have a very large appetite for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason for this is that they do not care for the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to care not only for the anointing and the sealing, but also for the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to say, "O Lord Jesus, You are so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, the sense of the Spirit's pledging will increase within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a real experience this is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A MUTUAL INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need both the sealing and the pledging because in God's work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 1:11 indicates that we were made God's inheritance, and verse 14, that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our inheritance is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's economy we are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a mutual inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit in us as a seal is God's guarantee that we shall be His inheritance Eph 1:13 ; the Spirit as a pledge in us is our guarantee that God will be our inheritance for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place and also a mutual enjoyment in which we will enjoy God as our eternal inheritance and He will enjoy us as His eternal possession; this is the consummation of His being dispensed into us and of our being constituted with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The anointing, sealing, and pledging describe three aspects of the Spirit's work in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The anointing is the moving of the compound Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It adds the divine element and essence to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Holy Spirit is also a living seal in us indicating that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This sealing continues in us until we fully bear the image of God in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, the Spirit is the pledge, the foretaste of the full taste of the enjoyment of God that we will inherit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit as a seal in us is God's guarantee that we shall be His inheritance; the Spirit as the pledge in us is our guarantee that God will be our inheritance for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>QUESTIONS What ground do we have for saying that the anointing refers to the moving of the compound Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Explain what we mean by the "paining" work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What are the two aspects of the Spirit as a seal in us?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How does Ephesians 1:13-14 indicate that the sealing in us is still going on?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the Greek origin of the word "pledge"?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does this tell us about the Spirit in us?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Describe the two kinds of inheritances and how the Spirit is the pledge and seal to guarantee these inheritances.</S>
