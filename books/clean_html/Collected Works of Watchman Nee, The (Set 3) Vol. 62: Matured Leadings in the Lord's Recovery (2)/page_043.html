<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF COORDINATION</h2><p>How can we be coordinated? Ephesians 4:15b says that we have to be joined to the Head Christ in all things. This includes our fellowship with Him. We have to ask ourselves all the time: Do we have a constant sweet fellowship with Christ? We should not only ask if our conscience is at peace, but ask whether or not we have fellowship with Christ. Peace in the conscience only fulfills a negative requirement. On the positive side, we have to have fellowship with the Head. Many times we have not committed any sin and there is no condemnation in our conscience. Yet inwardly we are depressed; there is no way for us to have fellowship with Christ. Perhaps there are some hindrances between us and Him. In order to have fellowship with Christ, we need to have clearances and dealings. When every member is joined to the Head Christ, the whole Body will be fitly framed together in Him. This means after we have fellowship with Christ, we must still ask ourselves whether or not we are fitly framed together with the brothers and sisters. On the one hand, coordination depends on our fellowship with Christ the Head and, on the other hand, with our relationship to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Today there are many saved Christians, but there are not too many who have fellowship with Christ. There are less who are joined to the brothers and sisters in their fellowship with Christ. A man may not err that much in his outward conduct, but fellowship with the Lord is a very sensitive and tender thing. As long as there is a little isolation, fellowship will stop. A worker can lose his fellowship with God just because he has held on to his work. This is a terrible thing. It is possible for us to lose God's fellowship yet still be successful in our outward work. It is possible for us to have God's blessing yet be void of the fellowship of life. If we have fallen into this condition, our outward contact with the brothers and sisters will be nothing but human endeavor. If the life within us is released and we have fellowship with the brothers and sisters, spontaneously there will be the coordination. Coordination is a matter of fellowshipping with the Head and being properly joined to the brothers and sisters. Our spiritual sense within, our fellowship with the Lord, and our relationship with the other members have to be strengthened and sustained.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STANDARD OF SERVICE<br />BEING ONE'S SPIRITUAL CAPACITY</h2><p>The extent to which we can say that a service in the church is right or wrong and the seriousness to which such mistakes should be viewed is judged purely by the amount of spiritual capacity we possess. For example, when the floor is dirty, we must not only deal with the person who is cleaning the floor but also with the spiritual principle. Usually when we encounter such a situation there are two ways to deal with it. The first is to deal with the ones who are responsible for the cleaning. Is this the right way to deal with it? All the brothers are clear that this is not enough. The second way is to deal with the spiritual principle. In the church it is more important to deal with things according to spiritual principles. The goal is that the one responsible for the floor would touch the Lord. It is useless to rebuke him so that he mops and cleans the floor but does not have any spiritual fellowship with the Lord or find any spiritual supply.</p><p>As the brothers and sisters are cleaning the floor, they should pray that the Lord would sanctify the spots where they are cleaning. They should pray that those who stand on it would fear the Lord, that an unbeliever would believe in the Lord, and that he would realize that he is standing on sanctified ground. If the brothers and sisters do this, an outward thing will be made to carry spiritual weight. Church service is not merely outward activities; it is for Christ to flow out of us through the Holy Spirit. This matter alone shows us the high standard Christ puts upon church service.</p><p>Suppose we have fellowship with the Head in the morning. By two o'clock in the afternoon, Christ may have a new demand within us. If we argue with Him and do not yield to this new demand, we will lose our intimate fellowship with the Head. When we come at four o'clock in the afternoon to clean the floor, we will not have any fellowship with the Lord, and our cleaning will be like the cleaning of any ordinary person. If a church only pays attention to outward activities, and is slow, dull, and dim in spiritual feelings, it will not carry much spiritual weight. Our service must be a service in the Holy Spirit. Although we can have many activities outwardly, the life of Christ within us must come forth. If we can do this, the church will be established in a real and genuine way, and we will see the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
