   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mis-positioning the Law Given by God as a Side Line to Christ as the Main Line in His Economy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Jewish religion has mis-positioned the law given by God as a side line to Christ as the main line in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his Epistle to the Galatians, Paul used two women in the Old Testament in Genesis to signify two things 4:22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two women are Sarah, Abraham's wife, and Hagar, Abraham's concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sarah signifies God's grace and Hagar signifies God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The position of the law is that of a concubine, and the position of God's grace is that of a proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law was given by God and is of God, but God put the law into the position of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Jewish people made the mistake of positioning the law as a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that they mis-positioned the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God gave the law as a side line to Christ, who is the main line in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God's economy there are two lines; one is the main line, and the other is the side line.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The main line is Christ and the side line is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible teaches mainly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the main subject of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ stands as the main line and even the main lane of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we drive a car, we do not want to drive in the side lane but in the main lane.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are driving in Christ, taking Christ as our main lane and main line.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews, however, are on the side line, remaining with the law as a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One among the Jews, Saul of Tarsus, later became an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He tried his best to correct the Jews because they were not in the main line.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Judaism is satanic because it does not stay in God's ordained line.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the Bible, God gave the law to help the Jews realize that they could not keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To try to keep the law is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, we should remain with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not get away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is our main line.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul took Christ in such a way, but the Jews would not take Paul's advice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Paul's word in Romans 7, the law is the instrument through which sin deceives and kills men v. 11 . The power of sin is the law 1 Cor 15:56 . This fact should warn us not to turn to the law to try to keep it, for in so doing we give sin the opportunity to deceive and kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those in Judaism have all been killed by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are five million members of Judaism in the United States today, and all of them have been distracted from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are on the side line of the law committing "suicide."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hagar, typifying the law, and her son were cast out Gal 4:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus those under the slavery of the law are driven out of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hagar brought forth a son named Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many Ishmaelites today fighting against Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The issue of Hagar is one who fights against God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ishmael persecuted Isaac Gen 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Judaizers, the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh, also persecuted the believers, the descendants of Abraham according to the Spirit, as Ishmael persecuted Isaac Gal 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Misapplying the Dispensational Sabbath-keeping</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those in Judaism also have misapplied the dispensational Sabbath-keeping Exo 20:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In history God set up a day called the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God created the heavens and earth and millions of things within six days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After these six days, God declared the seventh day as a day of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Sabbath was God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then God charged His people to keep that day as a memorial of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man was charged to keep the Sabbath to remember God's creation, that is, to remember that Jehovah, Elohim, is the Creator of the universe and of man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to realize, however, that God's ordination concerning the keeping of the Sabbath was a dispensational ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible God has different ways to deal with people in different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the early age of God's dealing with man, there was an ordination for man to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That ordination was for that age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was not an eternal ordination but a dispensational ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When that dispensation, or period of time, was over, the keeping of the Sabbath was over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Jews, however, did not realize this, so they misapplied the dispensational Sabbath-keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before Jesus came, Moses charged Israel to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That was according to God's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Jesus came, however, He was the Sabbath as the rest for God's people Matt 11:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Sabbath was a type, a shadow, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the person comes, the shadow is over.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not keep the shadow when we have the person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the person is here with us we do not disregard him to pay attention to his photo.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That would be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, when Jesus came, the outward ritual of keeping the Sabbath was over.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Jews fought against Jesus mainly due to the keeping of the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The observance of the Sabbath was abolished by the Lord Jesus in His ministry Matt 12:1-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That offended the Jews to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They wanted to destroy Him because of this v. 14; John 5:16 . Thus, they misapplied the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
