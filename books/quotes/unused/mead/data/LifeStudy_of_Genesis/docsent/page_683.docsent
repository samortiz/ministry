   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The last item the Lord requires is ourselves, including every aspect of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus will claim every part of you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have your ears been claimed by Him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they have, you will not listen to anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have your lips been claimed?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If so, then they will be used differently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Has your whole being been claimed by the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I doubt that very many have handed over their whole being to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why are there still so many opinions, and why is there so little oneness and building in today's Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is due to the fact that very few are willing to hand themselves over to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although you have heard many messages on consecration, you have probably not heard a message on handing yourself over to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regarding consecration, we have been influenced by the Keswick Convention, which followed Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith in emphasizing consecration as the key to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do you want to be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you must consecrate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you want to have your prayers answered and be victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then you must consecrate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But although we followed the Keswick teaching regarding consecration for years, we eventually discovered that it was not all that was needed for the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider what happened among us in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to some confusion and turmoil, Brother Nee had to discontinue his ministry for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of us were burdened that his ministry be resumed, and we did our best to bring this about, but we could do nothing to help the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before his ministry had been recovered, some of us had arranged to meet with him in his home for a time of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although there were about thirty who wanted to attend that fellowship, Brother Nee would allow only me and two sisters to meet with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was not willing to sell his supply cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, he allowed the others to sit in on the fellowship in a room adjoining his living room.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first morning no one said anything for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, unable to tolerate the silence any longer, I asked him to say a word about the confused situation of the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In response, he poured himself out like Niagara Falls for more than an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His word was full of light, power, and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For at least six years he had not spoken a public word in that district, although a few had contact with him privately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Nee's fellowship that day concerned the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>See the last chapter of Further Talks on the Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After he stopped speaking, no one said a word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then one sister said, "Why don't we take Brother Nee's word and practice it?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With tears, everyone present said, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We want to practice it."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Brother Nee replied, "If you intend to practice this way, you must hand over in writing yourself and everything you possess."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My point in sharing this is that we need to hand ourselves over to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps you have consecrated yourself to Him, but have never handed yourself over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today Christ is claiming not only your money, cattle, and land, but also yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By making the last payment, the payment of themselves, to Joseph, the people partook of the top portion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you pay the first, second, and third price, you enjoy the first, second, and third portion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when you pay the highest price, you enjoy the best portion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, we receive not only food for satisfaction, but also seed for reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to get the food and the seed, we need to pay the full price.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before handing over ourselves, we must hand over everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After they gave everything to Joseph, the people could say, "Praise the Lord, we are released!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We don't care for our money, cattle, land, or even ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We just enjoy the rich supply."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All that remained was the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a great blessing it is to give up everything for this enjoyment!</S>
