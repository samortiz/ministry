   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before God, we call it the "flow of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In every age God insures that this flow is not interrupted, that it is always progressing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The flow of the Spirit is progressing in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some time ago I was reading a compilation of Wesley's messages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I thank God because I can see that the flow of the Spirit has moved onward today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we look back and examine Wesley, on the one hand, we have to admit that his work before God was tremendous and that perhaps our living cannot match his.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, however, the flow of the Spirit is moving on progressively today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here is a basic principle: If we do what God wants to do in our generation, we will get the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If, however, we always hold on to our past and demand that God do according to what we rank as important and desirable, we will not get the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was all right to be a Martin Luther in the sixteenth century, but it would be insufficient just to be a Martin Luther in 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was all right to be a Madame Guyon in the Medieval Age, but it would be insufficient just to be a Madame Guyon in 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was all right to be a Wesley in the eighteenth century, but it is inadequate to be a Wesley in 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was all right to be a Darby in 1828, but it is insufficient to be a Darby in 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is ever pressing onward, and every instrumentality fulfills its function for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flow of the Spirit in the church is always going forward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here many people have a basic weakness; that is, they do not recognize the flow of the Spirit in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the church there have been many spiritual giants who have brought about many spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are heirs to their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Saints like Martin Luther, Madame Guyon, John Nelson Darby, Evan Roberts, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis all left us with some spiritual wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot thank and praise the Lord enough for this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet today even if we should succeed in being a Martin Luther, a Madame Guyon, a Darby, a Roberts, or a Mrs. Penn-Lewis, we would still be a failure because we would not have seen the central point the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every age hinges upon a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must admit that the whole trend of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, is an onward trend.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has been revealed gradually and even progressively in age after age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A brother in Hong Kong once asked me the significance of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I asked him, "What is the difference between the book of Acts and the book of Hebrews?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Acts is a progressive book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we get to chapter eight, we cannot go back to chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord had already gone to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we go back to Jerusalem, how could we ever get to the uttermost part of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where the Lord is, there is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit desired to go to Rome, and the Holy Spirit desired to go to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Going to Samaria was the first step; it was also a preparation for going to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Producing apostles among the Gentiles was a right and progressive thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the going out from Jerusalem, it would be wrong to have the desire to stay in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The apostles to the Gentiles kept going until they arrived at Rome.</S>
