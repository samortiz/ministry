   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, FAITH, AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must go on to consider what this faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The faith that has been infused into us is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the word spoken to us enters into us, it becomes the Spirit, and this Spirit is the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Ephesians 2:8, we are saved by grace through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The faith through which we are saved is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Faith as a gift always comes through hearing the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ is "the Author and Perfecter of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, Christ Himself is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is important that we not separate the word from the Spirit, the Spirit from faith, and faith from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These four all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this universe there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God speaks, we have the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we hear the word, the Spirit is infused into us and becomes faith, a faith which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we hear the preaching of the word of God, faith is thus produced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our experience, the word becomes the Spirit, the Spirit is the living faith, and this faith is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The proper speaking in the meetings of the church will always produce faith in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first two chapters of Galatians Paul speaks of Christ, but in chapter three he begins to speak of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through the hearing of faith we have received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also, the Spirit is supplied to us by the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates the urgent need for the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The hearing of faith as mentioned in 3:2 and 5 implies the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not hear the word of God, there is no way for us to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, only through the word can we apply Christ to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way to apply Christ is to contact the Word and hear the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we contact the Word, the word of God comes into us and infuses us with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Spirit becomes the faith by which we live Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Galatians 4:6 tells us that God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God sends the Spirit into our inner being through the hearing of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our experience testifies of this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we pray-read and assimilate a portion of the Bible, we receive the supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we have a living faith within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This faith is the proper realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With this realization we experience Christ living in us and being formed in us, and we also have the experience of being clothed with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reason for the failures in our daily living is that we depart from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not believe that any Christian can live in a proper way without the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we neglect the Word and pay no attention to all the verses we have heard, it will not be possible for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may try to live Him, but we shall not be able to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 5:5 Paul puts the Spirit and faith together: "For we by the Spirit by faith eagerly expect the hope of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Notice that Paul first speaks of the Spirit and then of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Faith and the Spirit are important aspects of the secret of experiencing Christ.</S>
