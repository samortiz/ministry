THE PSALMIST'S ADVICE<br>TO ALL THE EARTH FOR PRAISING GOD,<br>HIS GRATITUDE TO GOD FOR THE PAST,<br>AND HIS RECOUNTING OF GOD'S<br>GRACIOUS DOINGS TO HIM</H2><P>Psalm 66 covers three matters: the psalmist's advice to all the earth for praising God (vv. 1-4); the psalmist's gratitude to God for the past (vv. 5-15); and the psalmist's recounting of God's gracious doings to him (vv. 16-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist's Advice<br>to All the Earth for Praising God</H2><P>The psalmist begins by advising the earth to shout joyfully to God, to sing forth the glory of His name, to make glorious His praise, and to say to God, "How awesome are Your deeds!" (vv. 1-3). Then the psalmist tells God that all the earth will worship Him and sing psalms to Him and to His name (v. 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist's Gratitude to God for the Past</H2><P>In expressing his gratitude to God for the past, the psalmist says that He turned the sea into dry land (v. 6), that He rules by His might forever (v. 7), that He has kept their soul in life (v. 9), and that He has brought them forth into abundance (v. 12). Then the psalmist says, "I will come into Your house with burnt offerings;/I will repay my vows to You,/Which my lips uttered/And my mouth spoke when I was in distress./I will offer to You burnt offerings of fatlings /With the smoke of rams;/I will offer bullocks with goats" (vv. 13-15). These verses indicate that the psalmist is engaged in a business transaction. His offerings are his repayment to God for His goodness. First, the psalmist receives God's goodness, and then he pays for it with his offerings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Psalmist's Recounting<br>of God's Gracious Doings to Him</H2><P>"Come, hear, all you who fear God,/And I will recount what He has done for my soul" (v. 16). The psalmist then concludes this psalm by recounting God's gracious doings to him. As he does this, he again speaks of God's lovingkindness (v. 20).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_200.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_202.html">Next</a> </body></html>
