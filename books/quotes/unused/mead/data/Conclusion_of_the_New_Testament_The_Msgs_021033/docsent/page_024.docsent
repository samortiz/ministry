   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN CHRIST HIS PERSON 7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall cover Christ s person in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>E. IN HUMAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The foregoing messages on Christ s person have been mainly concerned with His person in the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to see His person in the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt, this aspect of Christ is also for God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for God to dispense Himself into our being, it was necessary for Him to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before God could dispense Himself into us, He first had to dispense Himself into the man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have pointed out that in His incarnation Christ was conceived of the Spirit of God and was born of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of this conception and birth, He has both the divine essence and the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when Christ became a man, He was the God-man possessing the divine essence and the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we need to consider Him, the God-man, in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son of Man, Found in Fashion as a Man</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In human living Christ was the Son of Man found in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was not only the Son of Man; He was found in the fashion of a man, for He lived as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew 8:20 the Lord refers to Himself as the Son of Man: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His living the Lord Jesus continually lived in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Philippians 2:8 says that, in His human living He was found in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word fashion denotes the outward guise, the semblance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a specific repetition of likeness in Philippians 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being found in fashion as a man, in the appearance of a man, He humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, having the form of God, He emptied Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death Phil 2:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Despised Nazarene</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His human living Christ was also a despised Nazarene John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mary conceived a child in Nazareth Luke 1:26-27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under God s sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered a census Luke 2:1-7, and this forced all the people to return to their places.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their home town.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, a mistake made by the Magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt Matt 2:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After Herod died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land Matt 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Joseph returned and learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised Matt 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason Jesus was called Jesus the Nazarene Matt 26:71; Mark 10:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Jesus Christ was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was called Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Immediately Nathanael said, Can anything good come out of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is difficult to say.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth but in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nathanael was troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, Come and see John 1:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ, the seed of David, was born in Bethlehem, but He appeared as a Nazarene from Galilee John 7:52 , a town that was despised by the people of that time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because the Lord was raised in Nazareth, others did not consider Him as one born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On one occasion Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Pharisees asked him, Are you also from Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>John 7:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Galilee was a Gentile region; the Bible speaks of Galilee of the nations Matt 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Pharisees seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, Are you from Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We know that Jesus came out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But out of Galilee there comes no prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem according to His hidden and secret way of appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a Nazarene, the Lord grew up as a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor comeliness, no beauty that we should desire him, for He was despised and rejected of men Isa 53:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For this reason, we should not know Him according to the flesh 2 Cor 5:16 but according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a despised Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was not a man outwardly in a high position; rather He was low, not in standard, morality, or virtues but in rank and position.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When He became a man, He took the lowest position and rank.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, He was despised as a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Galilee was a despised province, and the Galileans were a despised people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you consult a map, you will see that Samaria was between Judea and Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of these three provinces, Judea was held in high regard.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Samaria was despised because the people there were of mixed blood.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although the Galileans were not of mixed blood, Galilee was still considered an inferior region.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the people in that region, especially those in the city of Nazareth, were despised.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As we have pointed out, although Christ was born in Bethlehem, the royal city of David, He grew up in Nazareth and as a result became known as a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Matthew 2:23 says, And came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The prophets, in plural, indicates that this is not a particular prophecy, but a summary of the significance of several prophecies, such as Psalm 22:6-7.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The title Nazarene may refer to the Branch in Isaiah 11:1, which in Hebrew is netzer.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Branch there, signifying Christ, is a shoot or sprout of the stump of Jesse, the father of David.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then a new shoot sprouted from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The sprouting and growing of this shoot was in a situation of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, and He did not grow up in a renowned city like Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He was born to a poor home and grew up in a despised town.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All this made Him a Nazarene, not a lofty branch of a stately tree but a seemingly insignificant shoot from the stump of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although Jesus was a Nazarene, within Him there was the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, we should not know Christ according to the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Rather, we need to discern the inward reality of Christ.</S>
