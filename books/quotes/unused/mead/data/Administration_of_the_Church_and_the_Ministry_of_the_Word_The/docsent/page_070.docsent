   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE BEING NO RECONCILIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUTSIDE THE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since we have seen the ground, we must keep it steadfastly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no room for a middle ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no neutral ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the ground of denomination is right, we should not have another ground; we should all worship God in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the ground of denomination is wrong, there can be no reconciliation with it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be absolutely clear concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Reconciliation will not issue in blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, it causes both sides to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There have been many cases of compromise among us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some cases involved individuals, and others involved a group; some took place in southern China and others, in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result was always damage and loss; neither side was edified, and all our labor turned out to be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, most of the ones who attempted to reconcile with the denominations eventually went the way of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consequently, they became people without a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should never think that those in the denominations can help us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that not only can they not help us, but also if we reconcile with them, they will influence us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In northern China I was jailed and tortured by the Japanese because I was not willing to compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I had compromised with the denominations, I would not have been jailed, and there would not have been so many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was put into prison because I was unwilling to cooperate with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our friends in the denominations wanted to pull me to their side, to make me the same as they, but I stood firm.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, they spoke unfavorably about me to the Japanese military police, who eventually put me in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After three weeks of interrogation, the Japanese military police could not find any evidence against me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They said, Mr. Lee, we have interrogated you for three and a half weeks, but we cannot find anything wrong with you...Why is it that those in Christianity do not speak well of you? Their question made me realize that those in the denominations had spoken all kinds of evil words concerning me to the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The president of the United Christian Association, who was a classmate and neighbor of a brother among us, heard about my arrest by the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before I was imprisoned, a pastor s wife spoke to a crowd in front of her house, expressing her joy that the Japanese were about to discipline me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since I never cooperated with the denominations, they wanted the Japanese to discipline me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was truly under the threat of death when I was in prison, because it was as easy for the Japanese military police to kill a Chinese as it was to kill a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord kept my life during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After I was freed from prison, our friends in the denominations again asked me to cooperate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did not compel me; instead, I was informed that twelve congregations would participate in a conference and that a speaker from each congregation would deliver a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They also told me on which day I should give a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I told the brothers that even if I should die, I would not give that sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then an elderly brother accompanied me to visit the president of the United Christian Association, because I felt that, by courtesy, I should let him know that I could not accept the assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The president of the United Christian Association felt that I should consider the matter and pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I said that there was no need to pray, he said, Mr. Lee, what you are doing is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I solemnly replied, Since you have said this, I would like to tell you that the most you can do is to have me arrested and put in prison again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was difficult to believe that they used the expression dangerous when asking for my cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that this was the enemy s scheme to force us to be the same as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the time those in Christianity detested our being different from them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would reconcile with them and be the same as they were, the enemy would applaud loudly because his scheme had succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What God has shown us is not merely a matter of salvation or of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has shown us where a Christian should and should not be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the testimony we have borne for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan, however, has been pulling us away from this testimony, wanting us to reconcile with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When this happens, Satan has succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we should be clear and see our need to maintain this difference.</S>
