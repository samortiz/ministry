   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WITNESS OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING ONE WHO HAS DIED AND RESURRECTED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 1, the disciples who personally observed the Lord s death and resurrection immediately became witnesses of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8 says, You shall be My witnesses...unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By this we see that the Lord Jesus wanted the disciples to go out not to do a work but to be a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What kind of person should they be?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should be witnesses of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be a witness is not to go to court to testify of things you have seen and heard or to give details of a particular story.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, to be a witness means that the person for whom you are witnessing has become you, and you have become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your going is His going; your being there is His being there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are there to be His witness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not easy for Christians to understand the Bible, and it is even harder to comprehend spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the matter of being the Lord s witnesses, we often like to say, We need to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This saying is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As witnesses of the Lord, we often think that we need to give a good testimony for Him, testifying to people how lovely, real, reliable, and powerful our Savior is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, such an understanding is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we are the Lord s witnesses, testifying nothing other than the Lord s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, a witness of the Lord is one who has died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, every day He lived a life of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works John 14:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, the Lord did not speak from Himself but from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the Father spoke His word through the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To experience genuine death and resurrection means that a person lives not by himself but by putting himself aside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, he puts himself to death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the Lord put Himself to death, the One who was in Him was lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only when we put ourselves to death can the Lord Jesus be lived out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The two the Lord and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord said that He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him v. 10a . His speaking was the Father s working in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His speaking was not His own, but He spoke what the Father spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He spoke, it was the Father who was speaking in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, He and the Father not only lived one living, but they also lived by one life; the two were one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is very hard to explain, but it is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord and we, we and He, are living one living and are living by one life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we can say that it is no longer I but Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the meaning of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is no longer we.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our old man has died.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now it is Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He and we, the two, are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus never acted alone in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said that the Father never left Him, but the Father was with Him all the time John 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He never spoke by Himself, worked by Himself, or acted by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All His moving was one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His move was the Father s move, and His speaking was the Father s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All that He did was the expression of the Father, so the two were one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Himself always stood in death, and once He stood in death, the Father was able to live out from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord Jesus began His ministry, the first thing He did was to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Baptism denotes death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through baptism, the Lord Jesus proclaimed to man that He needed to die and be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He came out to work not by Himself but by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, He needed to die and be buried and let the Father live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From that day onward, these two the Father and the Son were one life and had one living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The man Jesus Christ lived a life of dying, and God the Father lived out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was the Lord s living of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He did not wait until His crucifixion to pass through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In fact, He died and resurrected daily while He was living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In principle, He always said, Father,...not as I will, but as You will Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not as I will implies that the Lord was dying, while but as You will denotes that the Father was lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the meaning of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We who serve the Lord today, either to go out to knock on doors or to perfect the home meetings, must see the truth expressed as, I have died, and it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul said that we who serve the Lord die daily so that we may no longer live to ourselves but to Him who died for us and has been raised 2 Cor 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that we die, and He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not an exchange of two persons, an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, this is the joining of two lives, as in grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To graft a branch into a tree is to join the two lives together.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One is eliminated, and the other one is lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The result is that the two lives join together as one life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>ALWAYS FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>AND LIVING AND WALKING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we pay too much attention to the number of people and to the outward activities in the church life, I am afraid that we will all become athletes who know only how to run a race; that is, that we will have only physical activities without functioning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If this continues, we will all become like robots, moving when the machinery moves and not moving when it stops.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We may pray for twenty minutes before going out for door-knocking, and our prayers may be thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Moreover, we may truly be filled in our prayer and have the feeling that the Spirit is with us in our going.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In spite of this, what worries me the most is that the Spirit is with us only at the time we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we go out to knock on doors, our going may become a mere activity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must remember that we are not the ones who cause people to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We may baptize people, but we cannot give them life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must learn that it is no longer I but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not I who goes door-knocking, who speaks, and who baptizes people, but it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must use our spirit and exercise the life and faith within us, declaring to God and to all the enemies in the universe, It is not I who goes door-knocking, but it is Christ who goes.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not I who speaks to people, but it is Christ who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is not I who causes people to believe, but it is Christ who does it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is not even I who baptizes people, but it is Christ who baptizes them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we have such an attitude, such a spirit, such a life, and such a faith, we will live a life that is always dependent on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Depending on Him in this way moment by moment is our abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He abode in the Father day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He was never detached from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>His move was the Father s move, and His speaking was the Father s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Today as we are serving the Lord, we must exercise to the extent that our going is the Lord s going, and our move is the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>At that time we will realize that we are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Instead, it is the Lord and we together, two spirits joining as one spirit and two lives joining as one life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Although our body acts, visits people, goes door-knocking, and baptizes people, our spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We need to exercise to be joined to the Lord as one spirit and pray all the time, O Lord, I have no way to impart life into others, but this is what You can do and should do.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Lord, I rely on You in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>You and I have become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As I am here baptizing people, it is Your Spirit who baptizes people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Lord, I can only put a man into a bathtub and immerse him in water, but I have no way to baptize him into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only Your Spirit can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thank you, Lord, that You and I have become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Whenever I am moving here, it is You who moves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is the faith we should exercise to have.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We also need to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Although we have received some training, we still need to follow the spirit when we go out.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Sometimes we think that we should do something in a certain way, but the spirit within us directs us in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We must follow the spirit immediately and walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In this way, everything we do will have the spirit as its base and life as its content.</S>
