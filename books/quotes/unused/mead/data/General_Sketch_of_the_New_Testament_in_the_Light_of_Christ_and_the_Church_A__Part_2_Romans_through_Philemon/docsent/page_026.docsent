   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem of the Abuse of Freedom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth case dealt with by this Epistle is the abuse of freedom of foods and in the body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>12-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In dealing with this problem, Paul tells the Corinthians that our bodies are members of Christ v. 15 , we are one spirit with the Lord v. 17 , and our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit v. 19 . The Problem of Marriage Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fifth case in this book deals with marriage life 7:1-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the entire sixty-six books of the Bible there is no other chapter which deals with marriage as clearly and inclusively as this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we read this portion carefully, we will see that the same basic principle applies to marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without Christ and His cross no problems with marriage can ever be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if we could settle a problem, it would not be in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Similarly, whether one marries or does not marry can only be settled by experiencing Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must apply the cross to ourselves and take Christ as our life even in the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will be clear how to solve the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why we emphasize that in reading these chapters, we must realize and apply the principle behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we can be clear about what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, verse 32 says, "The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an experience of Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we experience Christ and the cross, we will know how to please the Lord in the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not we marry, whom we marry, and how to maintain our marriage life all depend on how we please the Lord by experiencing Christ and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Problem of Eating</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sixth case is concerned with the matter of eating 8:1 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The case of division is fleshly, and the cases in chapters five and six are fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The case in chapters eight through ten, however, is both fleshy and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of eating has much to do with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were two kinds of believers who had no consideration for others in the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Certain believers were addicted to their way of eating, so no doubt they were fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others, however, were not fleshy but strong in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They did not care what foods they ate, but neither did they care for the conscience of the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They acted independently and thus became fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we read these chapters carefully, we will see that they deal more with the fleshly aspect of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some in Corinth were debating about the matter of eating not because they were addicted to a certain way of eating but because of the problem of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some believers who were not strong in their conscience felt that food sacrificed to idols had something to do with idol worship and that if they ate it, they would share in the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although this is a good thought, it is according to a weak conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others were strong concerning eating, but they were careless about others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is as if they said, "Idols mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All things were created by God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if the food is sacrificed to the idols, it is still good for us to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Toward themselves they were right, but toward others they were careless because they were fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They insisted on eating without caring for others' weak conscience, so they stumbled the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although they had the right to eat, they should have taken care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, chapter nine follows chapter eight to present the apostle Paul as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although he had the right to do many lawful things, yet for others' sake, he would not use those rights vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is an example to those believers who, though they are strong in their conscience and have the right to eat things offered to idols, need to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the case of eating sacrifices to idols, the first principle of this book is again needed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to experience Christ and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To experience the cross is to deal not only with wrong and negative things but also with lawful things, right things, and even our own rights.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was right for certain ones to eat food offered to the idols, and they had the right to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Idols mean nothing, and all of those foods were created by God as something good to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, in denying the significance of the idols they seemed to be eating for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, we must learn how to experience the cross even in dealing with lawful things so that we may take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a deeper experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may have the thought that the experience of the cross is mainly to deal with wrong things, wrong attitudes, and other wrong matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this case is an illustration showing us that although we have the full legal right to do certain things, we need to take the dealing of the cross for others' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this case, as well as in the others, the apostle Paul cared for the building up of the Body 10:17, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although we have the right to do many lawful things, we need to take care of the building up of the Body and the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not do anything to damage the building up of the Body or the relationships between the members.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this light, the meaning of this case is very transparent.</S>
