   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PEACE OFFERING TO THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE MEAL OFFERING A. The Peace Offering Is Based upon God's Satisfaction in the Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The peace offering is based upon God's satisfaction in the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The peace offering which God and we enjoy today is based upon Christ's being the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is indicated by Leviticus 3:5 and 6:12.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaking of the peace offering, 3:5 says, "Aaron's sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that the burnt offering is a base for the peace offering to be received by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the burning of the burnt offering as the basis, God receives the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. The Peace Offering Is an Issue of the Enjoyment of God and Man in the Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The peace offering is an issue of the enjoyment of God and man in the meal offering 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, the peace offering is based on the burnt offering; on the other hand, the peace offering is an issue of the enjoyment of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not a matter of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would enjoy Christ as peace in a practical, daily way, we must first take Him as our burnt offering to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we must feed on Him as the meal offering, enjoying Him as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Immediately Christ will become our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that we all have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we have experienced Christ as the offerings, we may not have had the knowledge of the pictures in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In presenting these pictures, Leviticus uses a number of technical terms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of us have experienced Christ without knowing these technical terms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of these terms is burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the morning, we may pray, "Father God, I love Your Son, and I would like to offer Him to You."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We enjoy Christ so sweetly and present this Christ to God to make Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to present Christ to God as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After presenting Christ to God as the burnt offering, we may say, "O Lord, You are my daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without You I cannot live."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is taking Christ as the meal offering, as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Meal offering is the technical term for life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we take Christ as the burnt offering and as the meal offering, we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the sense that something within us is joyful and that we are right with God and acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Earlier you might have had a problem and thus were not at peace with God, but now there is no problem, and you are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all may have this experience and enjoyment every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEACE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Leviticus we see that there are different kinds of peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the burnt offering is of different sizes, so the peace offering is of different kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A. Not Due to Christ but Due to the Different Conditions of the Offerers' Enjoyment of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fact that the peace offering is of different kinds is not due to Christ but is due to the different conditions of the offerers' enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes we enjoy a large Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At other times something happens, perhaps some disturbance in our family life, that limits our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean that Christ has become smaller; it means that the condition in which we enjoy Christ has become narrow and small.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan seeks to limit our enjoyment of Christ and to narrow the condition in which we are enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we must learn to overcome all kinds of situations, even praying in our "private room" Matt 6:6 in order to avoid interruptions, so that we may be in a better and higher condition to enjoy a larger Christ.</S>
