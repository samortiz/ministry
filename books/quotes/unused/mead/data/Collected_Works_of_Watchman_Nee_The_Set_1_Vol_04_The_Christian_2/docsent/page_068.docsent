   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, we have to spend some time to investigate, not from the church but from the Bible, the matter of ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we read through the New Testament, we will not be able to find one place where man must be ordained before he can teach, preach, administer the Lord's supper, or baptize others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning, we see the church in Jerusalem being dispersed and everyone except the apostles going out to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were not ordained to do that work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At least, the persecution was not an ordination to them!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Apollos and Philip were two examples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Timothy received the gift of prophecy through the laying on of the hands of Paul and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That laying on of hands was for the gift and not for the authority to exercise the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul committed his knowledge to the faithful ones, who would teach others with it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But nothing was mentioned there about ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people like to quote the case of Saul and Barnabas in Antioch as a Scriptural basis for receiving authority through ordination, but if we read this passage carefully Acts 13:1-4 , we will see that this passage cannot serve as proof of it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the contrary, it breaks down the doctrine of ordination of believers for special authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, let me ask, "Did Barnabas and Saul preach only after this "ordination," or had they done this long before already?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we try to give a fair answer, we will see the true value of ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, who ordained Saul and Barnabas?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Could the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch ordain apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has placed in the church "first apostles, second prophets, third teachers" 1 Cor 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can the second and the third ordain the first?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who believe in the authority of ordination should awake to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore what is mentioned here is nothing but a special commission of the Holy Spirit for Barnabas and Saul to do the work that the Holy Spirit had called them to do, that of itinerant preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact that the church in Antioch laid its hand on them was only a demonstration of their oneness and sympathy with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What then is the meaning of ordination?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If ordination is insignificant, then those who believe in the authority of ordination would not have argued so much for it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Strictly speaking, there are two sides to the matter of ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two aspects are the most common and popular notions of ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, the Roman Catholics and those who are superstitious about formalities think that ordination gives a person not only authority but spiritual power as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They consider that they have the apostolic power, and therefore they can give to others the Holy Spirit through their laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their priests, or fathers, are produced through this process of ordination, and as such, are different from ordinary believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, no other people of God can participate in their priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This special group of people then insert themselves between God and man, serving as priests and praying on behalf of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is then seen as the outlet of all graces, and the accomplishment of Christ on the cross naturally recedes to the background.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, in Protestantism, seemingly there is no such sin, and seemingly there is no need for us to belabor this point.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet Protestantism also has its view concerning ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not recognize the unreasonable demand of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither does it consider it a means for the ordained one to receive the gift at the time of ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet it considers the meaning of ordination as nothing other than an acknowledgement of the ordained ones being endowed with the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without such an acknowledgement, a person cannot and should not baptize others or administer the bread to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we must ask a question: what gift does a person use to baptize others or to administer the Lord's supper?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As to preaching, if a man has the gift of God already, why does he have to be acknowledged by man?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, it is assumed that the acknowledging ones have the discernment and the ability, while other common believers do not have this discernment and ability, and for that reason, they exercise their ability on behalf of the whole and acknowledge these gifted ones on their behalf!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This way of doing things is most unfaithful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He has given me a gift, I have to exercise it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God has given me a gift, but I have to go to man or before a congregation for acknowledgement and approval before I can exercise it, is this not offensive to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord gives us a gift because He reckons that we are worthy of exercising it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If that is the case, why do we have to be acknowledged by man?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But then, some say that man can be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They say that sometimes a man thinks that he has the gift, but he is wrong and that in reality he has not received the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, there must be the acknowledgement from man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is true that man can be wrong, but is it not true that those who acknowledge others can also be wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this is the case, who can we trust?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man is wrong, it is of course serious, but if a group who acknowledges a person is wrong, how much more serious is this?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If an individual whom God has not sent is mistaken, he can still turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if you have ordained him and have consecrated him forever, is not such a failure more serious?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he is not capable of being a pastor, yet has been ordained to be one, what shall he do now that he has become one?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not his ordainer is wrong, he is at any rate ordained and has become a clergyman and should therefore be assigned a field for his work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even if he is useless, he must be assigned at least a very small place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But then, even the believers in the small places are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why should they starve under such a one's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The one who has ordained such a one in the first place should bear the responsibility for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such an ordained pastor at least must take up three responsibilities in a church: as a teacher, as an evangelist, and as a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We know that a person does not necessarily have all three kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The worst cases may not even have any one of these three gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who have one gift are considered good already.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot expect a person to have all the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Throughout history there have been few who possessed all three kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If one is an evangelist, he has to lead many to repentance and to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But because he is not a teacher, these saved ones cannot be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Or perhaps one is a teacher and not an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As such, he cannot lead others to the Lord, and the church that he is managing will either have many empty seats or will be filled with nominal believers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he is a shepherd, he will be capable of caring for the sheep and of visiting his church members.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet he is neither an evangelist nor a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As such many nominal believers will remain forever nominal and will not know salvation nor be edified to grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of work where one is ordained to manage a whole congregation and where the whole congregation, whether it be thirty people or three hundred people, is assigned to the hands of one person alone as the "flock" under him, with no one else who can interfere or have any say in the matter, is the result of the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
