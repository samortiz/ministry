   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We might think that the apostle Paul would bring thousands to the Lord, but we can see in Paul's history that this was not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Colossians 1:28-29 Paul said that he labored to announce Christ, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that he might present every man full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He desired to admonish every man, teach every man, and present every man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The "every man" work could never be a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was the biggest gift, so we may think he would do everything miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Bible tells us that Paul was not able to do that many miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was not one who depended upon miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was one who labored all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Acts 20 we see that he was with the saints in Ephesus for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said that he served the Lord and admonished each one of the saints with tears vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>19, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tears indicate much hardship and difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said that he admonished the saints "night and day" v. 31 . He taught publicly in the meetings and from house to house v. 20 . He taught publicly, but his work was much more in the "every man" way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was not just giving lectures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul tutored each one of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who is always soaring in the air cannot bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps he will say that he gained three last week and two more this week, but after a year he will not gain one as remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He may say, "Well, last week I got two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, I realized they were not so good, so I gave them up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I have found some better ones."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, however, not one is better, and everyone has to be discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mothers are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every mother loves her child regardless of the child's appearance or behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>T. Austin-Sparks knew this quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He came to visit us in Taiwan for the first time in 1955.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "Every mother loves her child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are wise, don't say anything bad about her child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, you will offend her."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once a mother brought her child to him, and this child was not so attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But he dared not to say that before the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The mother handed over the child to him, and he felt he had to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said, "Oh, what a child!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was a neutral saying, but this caused the mother to think, "My, what a child I have."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To a mother, all her children are good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need such a mother's heart 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning a new one, we should not say, "He is not good material; I am sure he could never be like the apostle Paul."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have such an attitude, we will not be able to bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not work on that many people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, we should always keep just three or four under our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must learn to restrict ourselves in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord's constitution in Matthew tells us we have to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we have to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not think that we do not need to work too much, since we should not contact too many.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This would mean that we have stopped entering the narrow gate and walking on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is against the kingdom constitution to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's constitution of His kingdom is that we have to enter and then walk.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I say that we should not spread too much, I do not mean that we should not work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, we have to work every day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A good student prepares his lessons every day and does a little bit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The problem with us is that we do not work regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After being in the training concerning the vital groups, we still may not have started the vital work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may say that we do not feel that we are vital and that we will work when we become vital.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not work, we can never be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we would work, then we would be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is it to be vital?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be vital is to be common.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We Christians should be common in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should always contact the Lord, trying our best to remain in our spirit, doing everything according to the spirit, and praying unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This makes us a common believer, a vital believer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I can testify that without a certain amount of prayer, I cannot give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The message comes out of my common prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not have a time to be with the Lord in the morning to have some prayer, we will become weak and down.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The only way to rise up is to pray, "Lord, forgive me and cleanse me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Lord, anoint me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Taking care of the life principles makes us vital.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should carry out what God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God ordained that we should bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God ordained that we should contact people for His kingdom's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is God's ordination, and we have to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not carry out God's ordination, we can never be common.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead, we will be abnormal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Physically speaking, we must breathe, eat, sleep, and exercise properly if we want to be normal and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we do not take care of these things, it is impossible for us to be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To be vital simply means to be healthy, and to be healthy we need to breathe, to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to eat and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We also need to exercise to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At least we need to go out twice a week to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is God's ordination, and we have to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We also need to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To sleep means to rest in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not think that to be vital is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To be vital is just to be common, to be normal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Over thirty years ago, a brother told me that every time he saw me, I was so fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He wondered how I could be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If I do not pray and touch the Lord in my spirit, I can never be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead, I will be stale.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The key to my being fresh is that I contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This causes me to lead a normal Christian life, to become vital.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Often I pray for the churches around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If I do not pray, I feel abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Vitality comes from our being normal, common.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Now that we have had some training in the vital groups, we must take action.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must do our duty to carry out God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we do this, be assured that we will bear at least one remaining fruit yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All the life principles are implied in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Bearing fruit is a normal situation of a branch of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We need to practice what we have seen in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then we will be vital, and we will see the Lord's blessing following us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In these days I am so grateful to the Lord that His blessing has been following me for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>From my hometown, Chefoo, I went to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>From Shanghai I traveled through the provinces of China.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Eventually, I was sent to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>From Taiwan I went to the Philippines and to southeastern Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then I came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>For more than sixty years, I have seen the Lord's blessing following me.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If the Lord's blessing can be with me, it surely can be with all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If the Lord's blessing is not with us, we are abnormal; we are not vital.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must learn to enter through the narrow gate and then to walk on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Thank the Lord for His constriction.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We should not expect to be flourishing and spreading in an unrestricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Our going to Russia was not our kind of flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It was the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We have seen the Lord's constriction even in our going to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When we drive on the highway, we have to drive within the lines.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>That is constriction.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If we do not drive in this way, we will damage ourselves and others.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Do not expect to be big.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>You need to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The environment in the church life narrows us down and restricts us.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We have to enter through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Do not expect to do a big work and to become a great person.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Just live normally, commonly, always entering through the narrow gate and walking on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Then be assured that you will bear remaining fruit each year.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Also, many saints will be helped by you to pass through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I have been working for the Lord for over sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Nearly every day I am learning to enter through the narrow gate and to walk on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I want to be constricted.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I do not want to maintain a career of man to achieve man's enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Instead, I want to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ to carry out God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We should live a normal, common Christian life, seeking after the Lord and pursuing Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Always exercise to enter through the narrow gate and to walk on the constricted way.</S>
