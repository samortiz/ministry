   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Generation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to realize who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may answer by saying that He is the Son of God, but this genealogy does not have such a term.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it calls Him the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because Jesus is so wonderful, it is difficult to say who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus is the mingling of God with man, the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the generation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The generation of Jesus means that He is the mingling, the wonderful mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings, with all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should no longer think that Matthew 1:1-17 is just a list of names.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The generation of Christ is composed of:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Fathers</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are the forefathers, the great persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All together they make up fourteen generations 1:2-6a .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Kings</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the kings, the royalty, who also make up fourteen generations 1:6b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Civilians</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>the Captured Ones and the Recovered Ones</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The generation of Christ not only includes the high-ranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ was ranked not only with the patriarchs and with the kings, but also with a group of civilians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was not only of the great ones, of the royal ones, but also of the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this picture of the generation of Christ, we can see that it includes all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this brief record we have the words "carrying away" v. 17 . Abraham was called out of Babel, the origin of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The generation of Christ includes not only the called ones, but also the backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps five years ago you were a called one, but today you are a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The generation of Christ includes you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and carried away to Babylon as a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you ever been dethroned?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think you have not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our forefather Abraham came from Babylon; yet you went back, not willingly, but were carried back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord that the generation of Christ includes even the fallen ones!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After captivity there was the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many captives returned with Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I were to ask you which kind you are, you may say that firstly you were a called one, then a fallen one, and finally a recovered one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are all Zerubbabels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.</S>
