[1]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was tempted in all things.
[2]  He felt pain when He suffered; He felt sorrow when He was misunderstood.
[3]  Although the cross was in front of Him, before His time had come, while He was on His way to death, He sympathized with those whom He met and who had need of Him.
[4]  Why did our Lord not descend from heaven as a grown-up?
[5]  The Lord was able to sympathize with everyone while He was on the earth because He not only had the experience, but He also had the love.
[6]  If He had been only concerned with the suffering He was about to experience on the cross, He would have been occupied with His own suffering every day.
