   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What does it mean to run the race?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Does a man run every day and every minute of the day?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Walking is ordinary, but running is something extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Walking is a daily demand; normally, we walk step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Running, however, is not a daily thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On a racecourse we have to quicken our pace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The normal capacity of the body can support our walk, but in running the body is called upon to put forth extra effort.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The normal capacity of the body has to be stretched in order to take care of the extra need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At such times the body needs to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In running, the body is asked to supplement its normal functions with extra energy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Running imposes additional demands on the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The demand on our body is not as strenuous during normal times of walking; it only becomes strenuous when the body has to run.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, we may need only eight hours of sleep during ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if our work requires that we work four more hours one day, we should be satisfied with only four hours of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what it means to run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To run the race means to meet the extra demands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the three disciples failed to watch with the Lord, He pointed out the trouble to them: "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" v. 41 . What good is there in having a willing spirit if the flesh is weak? A willing spirit and sleeping flesh amount to the same thing as an unwilling spirit and sleeping flesh; both amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not enough for the spirit to be willing; the body has to be willing as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the body is not willing and insists on sleeping, it is no longer one's slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the body is not a slave, it would be futile to claim that the spirit is willing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not to say that the body is the source of sin or that it is an encumbrance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are saying that, for the sake of serving the Lord, there are extra demands on the body at times, and the body should rise to meet these demands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what it means to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must train our body not just to meet ordinary demands but to have an extra supply when there are extra demands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord was on earth, Nicodemus came to Him by night.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord could receive him without succumbing to tiredness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A few times He spent whole nights in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All these activities interfered with His sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not advocating that God's children should make a habit of spending nights in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if a man wants to serve the Lord, it is a shame if he never spends a night in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong to constantly spend the night hours in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are doing this, you are heading the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But it is a strange thing to serve God for ten or twenty years without having once prayed all night long.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not advocating the extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not telling people to pray throughout the night all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Making a habit of praying all night long is damaging to the body and even to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not agree with those who do not pray during the day but who give up their sleep at night for prayer; this is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if a worker of the Lord never gives up his sleep for prayer, there is something wrong with him also.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Running in a race is not a daily thing, but exercise is a daily thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to exercise to the point that our body will no longer rebel against us but will be subject to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have never exercised in this way and our body is never put under control, sleep will become our first priority when we set out for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our sleep will become our master.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If others do not touch our sleep, we can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as soon as others touch our sleep, we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is imperative that a servant of God exercise himself to make his body his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To make our body our slave means that when the Lord has a need and a demand, and when circumstances call for it, we can put aside the demands of our body temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can direct our body to provide the extra supply, to ignore its need, and to be under our control and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we cannot do this, we love ourselves too much and are useless in the Lord's work.</S>
