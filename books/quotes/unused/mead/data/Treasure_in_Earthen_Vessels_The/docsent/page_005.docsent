   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HUMAN WEAKNESS NOT LIMITING GOD'S POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, I would like to say that I especially thank God because no human weakness can limit God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What do we think in our hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We tend to think that if there is sorrow, there should not be joy; if there are tears, there should not be praise; if there is weakness, there should not be power; if there is pressing on every side, there should be constriction; if there is casting down, there should be destruction; and if there are doubts, we should be unable to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But tonight I would like to loudly declare that this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants us to arrive at the point where we see that everything human is just an earthen vessel to contain God's treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything human is an earthen vessel for God's treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nothing human is able to bury God's treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need to be disappointed when we meet with disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we cannot make it, we should allow something positive to come in, and when it does, it shines better, more brightly, and more gloriously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times we have doubts after praying, and we think that everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When faith comes, however, it magnifies the treasure despite the lingering presence of doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Faith makes the treasure more glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am not speaking of an ideal; I know what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's treasure can be expressed in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a spiritual paradox; it is precious to every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is in the context of this spiritual paradox that we live and learn to know our God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we journey along this way, we will discover the immensity of the spiritual contradiction that exists within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As time goes on, we find this cleavage, this dividing gulf, is ever widening; the contradiction within us is ever accentuated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, the treasure is expressed ever clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The earthen vessel remains an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How wonderful this picture is!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We find a man whose original traits remain intact, yet God gives him a patience far more excellent than his natural resilience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is better to see a man in whom God has placed humility than to see a naturally reticent person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is better to see a man in whom God has placed meekness than to see a person who is weak and impotent by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is better to see a person in whom God's power resides than to see a naturally strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The inward difference is enormous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It matters little what kind of earthen vessel we have; the treasure can always go inside.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The earthen vessel remains an earthen vessel, but it is now a filled vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All weak people think that they are too earthen; their vessels are too full of clay and they are without any hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please remember that we have no reason to be disappointed or troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever is spiritual, strong, powerful, and comes from the Lord can be manifested in us and will shine brighter and be magnified through the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since this is the case, we can see the importance of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, everything depends upon the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I must repeat, all situations revolve around this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every outcome is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those whose eyes are on the negative things are fools.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord can express Himself through everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we have the treasure, many will know it.</S>
