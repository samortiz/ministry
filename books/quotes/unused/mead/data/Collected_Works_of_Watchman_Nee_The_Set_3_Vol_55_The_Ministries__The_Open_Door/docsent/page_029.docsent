   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MACEDONIAN CALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Respectful greetings:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church in Dongsha has had very little growth in life in recent years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We lack the experience of reality in our living, and we do not have enough light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, because we lack fellowship with your locality, you are not able to feed us, and there is a general spreading of spiritual famine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I trust you are willing to supply us because of our immature spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have not had any special conference recently, apart from the prayer and fellowship meetings, visitations, and baptisms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are writing this letter as a Macedonian call: "Come over...and help us!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the future, if you have conferences, please notify us that we might attend.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We pray we would be able to receive the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This letter was written that you might know the condition of the churches in Dongsha.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are sending you a table listing the condition of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please grant our request and give us an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were too many signatures for this letter, so we have not published them here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please see pages 72 and 73 for the table of the condition of the Christian assemblies in Dongsha.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>July 8, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>INWARD TENDENCY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am a recently saved sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God in His mercy has placed me among the members to learn to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thanks and praise be to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After Brother Lan Tsi-yi returned from Shanghai where he attended the conference , he told us that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and its surrounding areas had received great grace and are avidly consecrating themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Lan hoped I would have the opportunity to go there and participate, and I also felt a tremendous inward desire to go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition, I have read Brother Yu Dao-sheng's letter from Zhanjiang to a brother here, written after the Young People's Edifying Meetings in the fall, telling him about the saints' hunger and thirst in pursuing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I felt as if oil had been added to my inward fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My inward condition has become very desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I intend to apply to the post office to transfer me to Shanghai for training.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have sought God's will concerning this matter continually with the brothers and am still in the process of seeking His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am afraid of falling into my personal likes due to my own zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not want to frustrate God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am also afraid of hesitation ahead because of too much analysis and thus neglecting God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am writing to tell you leading brothers my inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope you will not ignore me, but will instead give me an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will do what you counsel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May God bless you with abundant grace!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chang Guang-zhao</S>
