<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A FEW WORDS CONCERNING<br>THE WORK IN SHANGHAI</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Record of Mr. Nee's Speaking after a<br>Bread-breaking Meeting, in Shanghai<br>on the Morning of January 3, 1932)<br>Issue No. 23</H2><P>There is an important announcement today concerning what the brothers and sisters decided in our prayer meeting yesterday afternoon. In the Bible study meeting of the past month, we did our best to study the truth concerning the church. Therefore, our meetings should have a little change. During the past years and days, the affairs in the meetings were the responsibility of only one or two persons. In the beginning, the workers temporarily took up the responsibility of the affairs in the meetings because they were preaching the gospel and speaking the truth here. Now the time has come for the workers to move to the side and for the local brothers and sisters in the meetings to rise up to bear the responsibility.</P><P>According to the teaching of the Bible, the process of establishing a church in every locality is as follows. First, the servants of God, such as the apostles, go out to work. For instance, the apostles went to Ephesus, and they saved some people. The Ephesian believers were the result of their work. After they had worked and some began to meet, they could withdraw. They handed over the management of all the affairs to the elders and deacons of that place. From this we see that the local believers in a place should bear the responsibility of that place. Therefore, we would ask the brothers in Shanghai to rise up to bear the local responsibility.</P><P>On behalf of the brothers and sisters co-working here, I would like to make a small announcement to the brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us here. We have been working here for over four years. Many need to know about the nature of our work, the financial expenditures, and the direction of the workers' work. So, I will speak a little today in order that everyone may understand these things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. A WORKER BEING NOTHING MORE<br>THAN A COMMON BELIEVER</H2><P>Before speaking on the nature of the work, please study what the Bible says concerning this matter. We know that according to the Bible, everyone is equal in the meeting. However, in the aspect of work, there is a distinction between the special workers and the common believers. (Nevertheless, this distinction really should not be considered a distinction.) In human organizations, someone may tell you that there are some who hold offices while others are common believers. Is this scriptural? We have to know that according to the Bible, there is a difference between the workers and common believers in the matter of work. This difference is not due to a difference in their persons; it is due to a difference in their work. However, in the meeting, there is not the slightest distinction between anyone. Whether you are a laborer, a merchant, a student, a physician, or one who does the Lord's work, you are a believer and you are the same as all the other believers. Please remember, when the believers are gathered together, whatever class or kind of people they may be, they are all equal and the same. When you see a worker in the meeting, you may think that he is more special than you, as if he has some authority. But I must tell you that in the meeting, there is no difference between him and you. Now I will speak on the meetings and the work separately.</P><P>The Lord said to the disciples, "The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant" (Matt. 20:25-26). From this we know that there is never a distinction of classes and offices in the meeting. Nevertheless, there is a distinction in the work. The difference between an evangelist and others is not that he is the Lord's worker while the others are only common believers; the only difference lies in the fact that his work is not the same as that of the others. Furthermore, this kind of distinction is very obvious. All are believers, and all are brothers. Yet some brothers are physicians, some brothers are students, some are servants, and some are merchants. In the same way, some are evangelists. An evangelist is no different from other believers than a doctor or a merchant is different from other believers. There is nothing more to this distinction. In the meeting, everyone is equal as brothers. The only difference is that after he is dismissed, everyone has a different work. The work of evangelism is as unrelated to the church as the work of a merchant. Meeting, remembering the Lord, praying, singing hymns, exercising spiritual gifts, teaching the Word, preaching the message of God, and witnessing are things that every brother in the church possesses and bears in common. Just as conducting a business is not an affair of the church, in the same way evangelism is also not an affair of the church. Regardless of which brother, his position and work (according to his gift) is the same in the church. Paul said that everyone could prophesy. But for the work outside of the church, there is a difference between merchants, physicians, students, and evangelists.</P><P>After the meeting is dismissed, everyone begins to do his own work. Some practice medicine, some conduct business, some study, and some preach the gospel. When the time comes for everyone to meet together to worship God, everyone lays down what he ordinarily specializes in and is good at to serve God in one accord and receive edification. There is only the difference between everyone's ordinary work and not a difference between everyone's position during the meeting. This is the teaching of the Bible.</P>
