   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Forty-three THE PROPITIATION-COVER OF GOD Scripture: Rom 3:25-26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The propitiatory sacrifice is the propitiation-cover in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God set forth a propitiation-cover through Jesus In the Old Testament the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle is the meeting place for God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Holy of Holies there is an ark which contains the tablets of the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ten commandments express the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that if a man wants to be in the presence of God, he has to fulfill all these ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the real condition of man is that rather than keeping the ten commandments, he breaks them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, according to the ten commandments, God has to condemn man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, God is also full of compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His love causes Him to be gracious to man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see that God s love is conflicting with God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to fulfill both His righteousness and His love, God sent Jesus to be our propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus Christ was given to us by God s love and grace, but the shedding of Jesus blood for the forgiveness of our sins is according to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because His blood satisfies the righteous requirement of God, enabling God s love to come upon us, Jesus becomes the propitiation-cover of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Old Testament, the propitiation-cover is on the top of the ark, completely covering the law inside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that Jesus Christ and His redemption completely satisfy the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, God can no longer put the demands of the law upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By the blood of Jesus In the Old Testament, the blood was sprinkled upon the propitiation-cover for the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every year on the Day of Atonement the high priest had to bring the blood of atonement into the holiest of all and sprinkle it upon the propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, upon the propitiation-cover, God manifested Himself to meet with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There man also was able to meet God and obtain grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under the propitiation-cover there was the righteous law of God, while upon the cover there was the blood of atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The righteous law was putting demands upon man, but because of the blood on the propitiation-cover the demand of the law was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, in the New Testament, the blood of Jesus Christ satisfies the righteous requirement of the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the blood of Jesus Christ, God s righteous law can no longer put any claim upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the blood of Jesus Christ opens a way for God to grant us His grace without causing God to be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore it was through this blood that God established the Lord Jesus as the propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the faith of man The righteousness of God has already accomplished everything for us so that we might obtain God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we must receive this salvation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To receive is to open our heart to believe in Christ and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To believe is not only to agree or to confess, but also to receive in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To manifest the righteousness of God By our faith, and through Christ, God not only gave us grace, but also manifested His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every believer who obtains redemption through faith in Christ has both the grace and the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because Christ has accomplished redemption, His blood has satisfied the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus today if we believe in Christ and His redemption, God has to forgive us and justify us for His righteousness sake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God would not forgive or justify us, He would be ungracious and unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So today God s forgiving us and justifying us by faith manifests not only His grace but also His righteousness.</S>
