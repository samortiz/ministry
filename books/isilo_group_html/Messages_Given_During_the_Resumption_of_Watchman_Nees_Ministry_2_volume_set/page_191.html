If someone hit your right cheek, you would be angry when you go home. However, those who are joyful before the Lord are the ones who, after being hit on the right cheek, turn their left cheek to the enemy. After a person has been hit twice, he will be joyful, and he will be able to utter praise. The Lord's way is the way of absoluteness. Those who are not absolute cannot sing. I am not begging people to come to serve. I am showing you that you are a servant of God. God wants you to serve.</P><P>This time our conference is a co-workers' conference, but this does not mean that the responsibility is only on the co-workers. Today, the responsibility is on the whole Body. When we read 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12, we see that service belongs to the whole Body; it is not a service of three or five special people. For this reason, we asked all the brothers and sisters to hand themselves over. What the Lord wants is absolute service. We hope that every brother and sister can get through in this matter. The Lord wants such an absolute service. Not only the co-workers need coordination in their work; every brother and sister needs to be coordinated also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONLY SERVICE THAT COUNTS<br>BEING THE BODY SERVICE</H2><P>I want to ask the brothers a few questions. What kind of service is considered real service? The only service that counts is the service in which the whole Body serves. Only the Body service can be counted as real service. Either you are not a Christian at all, or you have to be a serving Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULL COORDINATION<br>BRINGING IN THE BODY SERVICE</H2><P>In order to have the Body service, there is the need for coordination. What is coordination? It is not a loose arrangement. If my hands are connected to my body, they will be useful. But if they are locked up upstairs, they will not be useful.</P><P>Since the time you have been a Christian, have you ever inquired of the Lord concerning your job, your house, and your business? Is your job suitable for the gospel? When a man moves to a new place, he considers whether the place is beneficial to him spiritually. But he never considers whether the job he takes will help him to give himself to the gospel. Today, our co-workers cannot seek for their own convenience in the work; they cannot freely choose their own field. Those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should in principle do the same thing. You have to hand over your job, and you should learn to coordinate together. In other words, all the brothers and sisters are co-workers. Everyone should hand himself over for the gospel. If there is to be coordination, it has to be a coordination of all the brothers and sisters. Some of us have to change our dwelling or our occupations, and all of us have to offer up our possessions. This is a great price. It may cause some to have heartaches. We have to realize that from the very beginning the Lord requires that we serve this way. Any service that drags its feet along is not joyful and clear-cut service.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_190.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_192.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 191</div><br></body></html>
