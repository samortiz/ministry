<p class="bold">WEEK 14 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 19:16-17, 21-22, 24-26</h2><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may <sup>1</sup>have eternal life?</p><p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good? There is only <sup>1</sup>One who is good. But if you want to <sup>2</sup>enter into life, <sup>3</sup>keep the commandments.</p><p>21 &nbsp;Jesus said to him, If you want to be <sup>1</sup>perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, <sup>2</sup>follow Me.</p><p>22 &nbsp;But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions.</p><p class="bold">24 &nbsp;And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p> <p>25 &nbsp;And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be saved?</p><p class="bold">26 &nbsp;And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>16<sup>1</sup> Having eternal life as spoken of in Matthew differs from having eternal life as spoken of in John. Matthew is concerned with the kingdom, whereas John is concerned with life. In John, to have eternal life is to be saved by God’s uncreated life that we may live by that life today and for eternity; but in Matthew, to have eternal life is to participate in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age by God’s eternal life and to share in the kingdom’s manifestation in the coming age, thereby enjoying God’s eternal life in a fuller way.</p><p>17<sup>1</sup> This One is God. Only God is good. This indicates not only that the young man asking the question was not good but also that the Lord Jesus is God, who is good. If He were not God, He too would not be good.</p><p>17<sup>2</sup> Here to enter into life means to enter into the kingdom of the heavens (v. 23). The kingdom of the heavens is a realm of God’s eternal life. Hence, when we enter into it, we enter into God’s life. This differs from being saved. To be saved is to have God’s life enter into us to be our life, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God’s life to enjoy the riches of God’s life. The former is to be redeemed and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, whereby we receive God’s life; the latter is to live and walk by God’s life. One is a matter of life; the other is a matter of living. See note 16<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>17<sup>3</sup> This is not the requirement for salvation; it is related to entering into the kingdom of the heavens. According to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens requires us to meet not only the standard of the old law but also the standard of the complemented new law given by the King (5:17-48). Salvation requires only faith, whereas the kingdom of the heavens requires the surpassing righteousness that issues from the keeping of the old law and the complemented law given by the heavenly King.</p><p>21<sup>1</sup> Even though the young man had observed the commandments of the old law—or so he assumed—he still was not perfect, not up to the standard of the requirement of the complemented new law, for he was not willing to sell what he had and store up treasure in heaven, as the constitution of the kingdom required (6:19-21).</p><p>21<sup>2</sup> To follow the Lord is to love Him above all things (10:37-38). This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>As most Christians do today, the disciples confused salvation [v. 25] with entering into the kingdom of the heavens.…By our human life it is impossible to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but it is possible [v. 26] by God’s divine life, which is Christ Himself imparted into us so that we can live the kingdom life.
