Bringing God to His Chosen People<br />and Bringing God&rsquo;s Chosen People<br />into the Rich Supply of God&rsquo;s Full Salvation</h2><p>Moses was sent by God and God was with him (Exo. 3:12). Hence, when he was sent to the children of Israel, he brought God to them. Furthermore, he would not only bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of slavery, but he would also bring them into Canaan, a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey (Exo. 3:8, 10, 17). Milk and honey signify the two aspects of the riches of Christ&rsquo;s life: the animal life, representing the redeeming life, and the vegetable life, representing the generating life. These two aspects of the riches of Christ are the riches of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Therefore, Christ as the Apostle came from God and with God to us in order to bring God to us and to bring us into the rich supply of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Faithful to God<br />in All the House of God</h2><p>Moses as one sent by God to take care of God&rsquo;s house was faithful to God in all God&rsquo;s house. In Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel (Lev. 22:18; Num. 12:7). This typifies that Christ as the Apostle sent by God for God&rsquo;s house, the church, was faithful to Him who constituted Him (Heb. 3:2).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Christ Having More Honor and<br />Being Worthy of More Glory Than Moses</h2><p>Hebrews 3:3-4 says, &ldquo;He [Christ] has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that Christ, who built God&rsquo;s house, is God, and as such, He has more honor and has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, who was built as a part of God&rsquo;s house.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Christ Being the Son of God<br />over God&rsquo;s House;<br />Moses Being a Servant of God for a Testimony<br />of the Things to Be Spoken Later</h2><p>Hebrews 3:5 says, &ldquo;Moses...as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later.&rdquo; <em>Servant</em> here is a designation that implies dignity and freedom. <em>Testimony</em> may also be rendered <em>prefigure.</em> Hence, although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;But Christ...as a Son over His [God&rsquo;s] house.&rdquo; <em>House</em> in Greek denotes <em>family,</em> referring to the members of the house. God&rsquo;s house is not a physical house but a living family; God dwells in His living family, His folks. His folks are His house. Hence, God&rsquo;s house is a living constitution constituted with the many children of God in the Father&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Such a house is built up, ruled over, and taken care of by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is the Apostle sent by God. Christ is not only building up this house but also ruling over and taking care of it, carrying it on with Him to walk and move with God the Father. This is typified in the Old Testament by Moses, who took care of all God&rsquo;s house, the house of Israel, and led them to walk with God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. MOSES TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE PROPHET OF GOD</h2><p>A prophet is God&rsquo;s spokesman, not mainly to predict things that are coming but to speak for God and speak forth God by God&rsquo;s revelation. In his forty years of leading the children of Israel, Moses continually spoke to them for God, and especially in Deuteronomy he repeatedly spoke God&rsquo;s words to them. Although it was Moses who spoke, he did not speak his own words; he spoke God&rsquo;s words. He spoke for God, spoke forth God, and spoke God into the children of Israel. Every word he spoke also became God&rsquo;s word. As such a prophet Moses was also a type of Christ (Acts 3:22-23).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 3, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
