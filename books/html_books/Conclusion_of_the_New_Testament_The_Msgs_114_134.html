OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR LIFE</h1>
<p>In the foregoing messages on the believers we have covered the believers&rsquo; status, designations, and symbols. These three matters all deal with what the believers are. Because the believers are a certain kind of person, they have a particular status, they are designated in definite ways, and they are symbolized by many different kinds of things. We come now to the believers&rsquo; life.</p>
<p>The life of the believers is in three stages: the stage of creation, the stage of the fall, and the stage of God&rsquo;s salvation. We were created by God, we became fallen, and then we were saved. We have one kind of life in creation, another kind in the fall, and a third kind in God&rsquo;s salvation. Therefore, as we consider our life as believers, we need to keep in mind that we have passed through the three stages of creation, fall, and salvation. Let us now consider the believers&rsquo; life in these three stages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A. IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. A Created Life</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s creation our life is a created life (Acts 17:26). Therefore, in creation we have not an uncreated life but a created life. When God created Adam, He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and Adam became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). In this way Adam obtained the created life of man.</p>
<p>As the Creator, God is the source of man. First, God used the dust to form man&rsquo;s physical body, and then He breathed into that body the breath of life, which caused the body to become alive. As a result, man became a living soul. In Genesis 2:7 there is the strong indication that human life came from God. In this sense man was not only created by God but also produced by God. We are not told in the Scriptures that God breathed the breath of life into animals. Only in creating man did He breathe into man the breath of life. Proverbs 20:27 uses for &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; the same Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;breath&rdquo; in Genesis 2:7. This reveals that the breath of life breathed into man by God is the element of man&rsquo;s spirit. Actually, this breath of life became man&rsquo;s spirit. The point we are emphasizing here is that the Bible indicates clearly that man was produced by God. We do not say that in creation man was born of God, but we do say confidently that man was produced by Him. God formed man&rsquo;s body, breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</p>
<p>Immediately after man was created by God, in God&rsquo;s eyes he was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (Gen. 1:31) and &ldquo;upright&rdquo; (Eccl. 7:29). Therefore, the created life of man was originally good and upright. It was not only without sin but also without the knowledge of sin and the consciousness of shame. It was innocent and pure. Although this life was pure, it did not contain the element of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. A Human Life</h2>
<p>Since our life in God&rsquo;s creation is a created life, it is also a human life (Acts 17:25b-26), not a divine life. Furthermore, because our created life is human and not divine, it is a temporary life. Hence, in creation we have a created life, a human life, and a temporary life, not an uncreated life, a divine life, and an eternal life.</p>
<p>Our human life does not come merely from our parents; it comes from God&rsquo;s creation. Our human life was created when Adam was created, not when we were born of our parents.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. A Life Bearing God&rsquo;s Image</h2>
<p>The human life created by God does not have the life and nature of God; however, the created human life does bear the image of God (Rom. 5:14; cf. 2 Cor. 4:4b). In God&rsquo;s creation our life is a life of bearing God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let us make man in our image.&rdquo; Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4 both say that the image of God is Christ. Christ is the image of the invisible God. Because man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ, man was created in the image of Christ. In Genesis 1:26 God says, &ldquo;Let us make man in <em>our</em> image,&rdquo; but verse 27 says, &ldquo;God created man in <em>his</em> own image.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;his own image&rdquo; refers to the image of Christ. Therefore, man was made in the image of Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 5:14 says that Adam, the first man, was a &ldquo;type of the coming One,&rdquo; that is a type, a figure, of Christ. If we take a photograph of a person, that photograph is the figure, or type, of the person. We may say that Adam as a type of Christ was a photograph of Christ. Christ is the image of God, and Adam was a picture of Christ. As a photograph is the expression of a certain image, so man was made to be the expression of the image of God, which is Christ.</p>
<p>It is a very significant matter that the created human life is a life bearing the image of God, and we need to consider this in more detail. In the Scriptures the word &ldquo;image&rdquo; is used to refer to God&rsquo;s being. Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God, Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ is &ldquo;the image of the invisible God,&rdquo; and Hebrews 1:3 reveals that Christ is &ldquo;the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance.&rdquo; Christ, the embodiment of God, is God&rsquo;s image. Furthermore, according to the Bible, the image of God is related to His duplication. For man to be created in the image of God means that he was made in such a way that he could become God&rsquo;s duplication. God created man in His own image with the intention that man would become His duplication. Since God created man for the purpose of man&rsquo;s becoming His duplication, and since this purpose is indicated by the use of the word image in Genesis 1 we may go on to say that the word image implies the capacity to contain God. In order for man to be a duplication of God, he must have the ability to contain God. The man created in God&rsquo;s image was to be God&rsquo;s container. Because man was made to be such a container, there was the need for him to have the capacity to receive God as his content and to contain this content.</p>
<p>If we would understand the significance of the created human life being a life bearing God&rsquo;s image, we need to realize that this involves the divine attributes and the human virtues. The Bible tells us that God is love and light (1 John 4:8; 1:5). Love is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, and light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. The Bible also reveals that God is righteous and holy. God is righteous in His doings and holy in His nature. Therefore, God is love and light, and He is righteous and holy. God&rsquo;s image is depicted by these four words: love, light, righteous, and holy. These are God&rsquo;s attributes.</p>
<p>Because man was made in God&rsquo;s image, man has love and light and the capacity to be righteous and holy. For God to create man in His image means that He created man with the capacity to have His love, light, righteousness, and holiness. Human love, light, righteousness, and holiness are what we call the human virtues. God created man in His image in such a way that man has the ability to contain God&rsquo;s love, light, righteousness, and holiness. The human virtues were created by God to contain His attributes. This means that human love, light, righteousness, and holiness are created capacities to contain the divine love, light, righteousness, and holiness. The point here is that man has these virtues because he was created in God&rsquo;s image, in the image of God&rsquo;s love, light, righteousness, and holiness. The human virtues created by God are the capacity to contain God&rsquo;s attributes. Therefore, God created the human life to be a life bearing the image of God.</p>
<p>If Adam had eaten of the tree of life and thereby had taken God into him as life, he would have been filled with God, and his human virtues would have been filled with God&rsquo;s attributes. As we know, Adam fell by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life, thereby taking into him the life of Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">B. IN THE FALL</h2>
<p>Let us now go on to consider the believers&rsquo; life in the second stage&mdash;in the stage of the fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. A Life Mingled with the Devilish Life</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that due to the fall of man, besides the human life, there is also in man the life of Satan. Therefore, Romans 7:18, 20 says that in man, that is, in the flesh of man, sin also dwells. Sin here refers to the life of Satan. This flesh, which contains the life of Satan, according to Galatians 5:17, continues to remain within man after he is saved, and often lusts against the Spirit. Therefore, after a person is saved, he still has Satan&rsquo;s life in him.</p>
<p>In Adam we all became fallen. The fall caused a great change in our life, for in the fall our life was mingled with the devilish life. When Eve accepted the satanic proposal to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Satan&rsquo;s element entered her soul and polluted it. Thus, the first result of the fall was that the soul of man was contaminated through Eve&rsquo;s receiving the Devil&rsquo;s thought and word. Eve should not have spoken to the evil one. While she was talking with him, his evil thought entered her mind and corrupted it. This means that even before she partook of the tree of knowledge, her mind had been polluted by the enemy&rsquo;s concept. The satanic proposal poisoned man&rsquo;s soul, causing it to be mingled with the life of the Devil.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, his body, as well as his soul, was poisoned by Satan. Then his spirit was deadened in the sense of being cut off from contact with God. Due to the fall, man&rsquo;s mind and body were poisoned, and his spirit, the organ created for the purpose of contacting God and receiving Him, was deadened. This is the real picture of man&rsquo;s life in the fall.</p>
<p>Both God and Satan want man. God desires man for the accomplishment of His will, and Satan wants man for the fulfillment of his evil desire. The method of both Satan and God in gaining man is through life. God&rsquo;s intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life and thus obtain His uncreated life and be one with Him. However, Satan enticed man to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thus causing man to obtain his fallen life and be mingled with him. When Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan&rsquo;s life entered into him, causing him to become corrupted. As a result, besides his own original created life, man also obtained the fallen life of Satan.</p>
<p>After Adam sinned and fell, man not only offended God in behavior, which resulted in a sinful situation, but, worse still, he was poisoned by Satan in life, which caused his life to become defiled and corrupted. Adam had not only disobeyed God&rsquo;s prohibition but also had taken Satan&rsquo;s life into himself. Henceforth, man has become inwardly complicated. He has the original upright and good life of man and also the evil and corrupted life of Satan.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s life, filled as it is with all kinds of sins, contains the seed of all corruption and factors of evil. Satan lives within man and causes him to have lusts (John 8:44) and commit sins (1 John 3:8). Therefore, his life is the root of sins, which causes man to live out sin. The various sins committed by man are derived from the life of Satan within him. Ever since this devilish life entered into man, though at times he is still able to live out a little human goodness according to his human life, he lives out the devilish evils most of the time according to the devilish life.</p>
<p>First John 3:8 says, &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning.&rdquo; Man&rsquo;s fallen life is of the Devil, whose life is one of sin and who sins habitually from the beginning. Sin is his nature, and sinning is his character.</p>
<p>First John 3:10a goes on to say, &ldquo;In this the children of God and the children of the Devil are manifest.&rdquo; To practice sin or not, that is, to live in sin or not, is not a matter of behavior. It is a matter of whose children we are&mdash;the children of God or the children of the Devil. This is a matter of life. Men, as fallen descendants of Adam, are born children of the Devil, the evil one, possessing his life and living in sin automatically and habitually. Practicing sin is their life.</p>
<p>John 8:44 says, &ldquo;You are of your father the Devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it.&rdquo; Because the Devil is the father of sinners, the sinners are children of the Devil. The Devil is the old serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), and the sinners are also the &ldquo;serpents, the brood of vipers&rdquo; (Matt. 23:33; 3:7). Hence, they need the Lord Jesus to be lifted up for them in the form of the serpent on the cross (John 3:14). The Devil is the evil father who has brought forth sinful children. These sinful children are all followers of the Devil. The evil life of the Devil, working as sin within man, enslaves man to sin.</p><h2 class="head2">2. A Life of Sin</h2>
<p>In the fall our life is a life of sin. Romans 7:14 says, &ldquo;I am fleshly, sold under sin.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;sold under sin&rdquo; means sold to sin. Sin is the buyer, and we have been sold to him.</p>
<p>Romans 7:17 goes on to say, &ldquo;It is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;dwells&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;make a home,&rdquo; for the verb has the root meaning of house or home. Therefore, this verse is not saying that sin merely remains in us but that sin makes its home in us. For this reason, it is no longer we who do the evil that we do not want to do, but sin that makes its home within us.</p>
<p>Romans 7:20 says, &ldquo;If what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo; This verse is further proof that our life in the fall is a sinful life, a life that is devilish, satanic.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. A Life Dominated<br />
by the Law of Sin and Death</h2>
<p>Our life in the fall is also a life dominated by the law of sin and death (Rom. 7:23; 8:2). A law denotes a natural power with a certain tendency and activity. Every kind of life has a law. For example, it is the law of the bird life to fly and the law of an apple tree to bear apples. Because every kind of life has its own law, the devilish life, the life of sin, also has its law&mdash;the law of sin and death. Paul speaks of this law in Romans 7:23: &ldquo;I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members.&rdquo; The law of the mind here is not the Mosaic law. This is the law in our nature created by God, a law of trying to do good. But the law of sin in our members is always warring against this good law in our mind and making us captive to the law of sin. The evil law wars against the law of good and invariably captures us. Thus, we become a captive in the law of sin which is in our members. This is not a doctrine; this is our life-history.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:2 Paul again speaks of the law of sin. In order to impress you with the seriousness of our life in the fall being dominated by the law of sin and death, I shall use the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; as a verb. The law of sin &ldquo;laws&rdquo; us; we all have been &ldquo;lawed&rdquo; by this law. We simply cannot escape the &ldquo;lawing,&rdquo; the spontaneous working, of the law of sin within us. According to 8:2, the law of sin is also the law of death. When this law &ldquo;laws&rdquo; us, we are involved not only with sin but also with death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">C. IN GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>The unbelievers have passed through the stage of creation and remain in the stage of the fall, but the believers have been transferred into a third stage&mdash;the stage of God&rsquo;s salvation. This means that as believers we have not only the human life and the satanic life but also the divine life, the life of God. Just as Satan, in the fall, injected his life into us and caused us to be united with him, gained by him, and possessed with all the evils of his life, so God, in His salvation, puts His life into us and causes us to be united with Him, gained by Him, and possessed of all the riches of His life. Therefore, just as the crucial point of the fall was life, so also the crucial point of salvation is life. Now, in addition to our original created human life and the life of Satan obtained through the fall, we also have the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. A Human Life Mingled<br />
with the Divine Life&mdash;the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>The life we have in God&rsquo;s salvation is a human life mingled with the divine life, the eternal life. The Gospel of John reveals that we receive the divine life by believing in the Son of God (1:12-13; 3:15-16). The divine life does not come into us to replace the human life; rather, the divine life is mingled with the human life. This mingling of the human life and the divine life is illustrated by the grafting of a branch from one tree into another tree. In grafting two lives are joined and then grow together organically. Because the human life was made in the image of God and according to the likeness of God, it can be joined to the divine life and mingled with it. Although our human life is not the divine life, it resembles the divine life. Therefore, these two lives can be grafted and grow together organically. This is the mingling of the human life with the divine life in the believers.</p><h2 class="head2">2. A Life Freed from the Law<br />
of Sin and Death<br />
by the Law of the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; This reveals that the believers&rsquo; life in God&rsquo;s salvation is a life freed from the law of sin and death by the law of the Spirit of life. The two laws in Romans 8:2&mdash;the law of sin and of death and the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;are principles, not commandments. These laws operate by nature. The divine life is the strongest life, and the law of the divine life is the strongest law. As believers, we have a law operating in us which is the strongest law in the universe. This law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p>Life is the content and the issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit who is life to the believers in Christ. The law which has freed us from the law of sin and death is of this Spirit. It is this law, not God nor the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin and death. Therefore, the life of the believers in God&rsquo;s salvation, a human life mingled with the divine life, is a life freed from the law of sin and death by the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. A Life Uplifted in Christ&rsquo;s<br />
Resurrection and Transformed<br />
by the Pneumatic Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the life of the believers in God&rsquo;s salvation is a life uplifted in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and transformed by the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit. First Peter 1:3 reveals that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Here we have two matters: regeneration and resurrection. Regeneration and resurrection make us different persons. It is a fact that, as believers, we have been regenerated through the process of the resurrection of Christ. Therefore, our entire tripartite being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;has been uplifted, having passed through the process of the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to believe that our life is now a life uplifted in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The process of the resurrection of Christ has uplifted our whole being. Instead of trusting our feelings, we should believe the fact according to the pure word of the divine revelation. First Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. We have passed through the resurrection of Christ, and we have been uplifted by it. If we believe God, we should also believe His word which says that our life as believers has been uplifted in the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Not only is our life uplifted in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection; it is also transformed by the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6b, 17-18). Romans 12:2 speaks of our being transformed by the renewing of the mind. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are transformed into the same image, the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ, from glory to glory. Our human life needs to be transformed, and the Lord is working in us concerning this. We need to cooperate with Him, offering Him a proper coordination. As we cooperate with the Lord, He will have a free way to transform our human life with the element of the divine life.</p>
<p>The One who is transforming us is the pneumatic Christ, that is, Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Derived from the Greek word <em>pneuma,</em> &ldquo;pneumatic&rdquo; means spiritual. However, the pneumatic Christ is not a spiritual Christ; the pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit. The Christ who gives life is the pneumatic Christ. He is not Christ in the Spirit; He is the Christ as the <em>pneuma,</em> as the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we describe the Christ who lived on earth, we may speak of Christ in the flesh. As we have pointed out, the term &ldquo;pneumatic Christ&rdquo; refers to Christ as the Spirit. Due to traditional teaching concerning the Trinity, we may regard the Spirit as a person separate from Christ and then go on to speak of Christ being in the Spirit. Although it is commonly understood that the phrase &ldquo;Christ in the flesh&rdquo; refers to Christ Himself while He was on earth, not many understand the term &ldquo;Christ in the Spirit&rdquo; to mean that Christ is the Spirit. This has made it necessary for certain teachers to adopt the term &ldquo;pneumatic Christ&rdquo; to denote the Christ who is the Spirit. Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit. They do not realize that Christ is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;pneumatic&rdquo; means spiritual. However, if we use the term &ldquo;spiritual Christ&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;pneumatic Christ,&rdquo; there may be misunderstanding. The New Testament reveals that the resurrected Christ became the Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; This is the pneumatic Christ, the very Christ who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>It is crucial for us to see that it is the pneumatic Christ, not merely the doctrinal or historical Christ, who is real and practical to us in our daily life. It is the pneumatic Christ, the actual and practical Christ in our experience, who is transforming us. Our life in God&rsquo;s salvation is a life of transformation by the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>We have seen that as believers we have three different lives&mdash;the created life of man, the fallen life of Satan, and the uncreated life of God. Though we have all three lives within us, yet we obtain them at three different junctures due to three different occurrences. First, at the time of creation and through creation we obtained the created life of man. Second, during the fall, due to our contact with Satan and the tree of knowledge of good and evil, we obtained the fallen life of Satan. Third, at the time of our salvation, because we believed in the Son of God and received Him, we obtained the uncreated life of God. Due to the fact that these three events&mdash;creation, fall, and salvation&mdash;occurred in us, we obtained the three lives, the lives of man, Satan, and God, each life differing from the others in nature.</p>
<p>Because we have three lives&mdash;the created life, the satanic life, and the divine life&mdash;we are in a triangular situation comparable to that of Adam in the garden of Eden. Adam was in a triangular situation involving himself, Satan (signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil), and God (signified by the tree of life). The believers are in a triangular situation involving the created human life, the satanic life, and the divine life, each of which has its own law, a principle that works automatically. If we would grow in the divine life, we need to know these three lives; that is, we need to know the life of the believers in the three stages of creation, fall, and salvation.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR NATURE</h1>
<p>We have seen in the foregoing message that the believers&rsquo; life is in three stages: God&rsquo;s creation, the fall, and God&rsquo;s salvation. The same is true of the believers&rsquo; nature. Therefore, in this message we shall consider the believers&rsquo; nature in God&rsquo;s creation, in the fall, and in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A. IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. A Human Nature</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s creation we have a human nature. Acts 17:26a says, &ldquo;He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth.&rdquo; The &ldquo;one&rdquo; here is Adam. God made from Adam every nation of men to dwell on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>In Acts 17:28 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;In Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we also are His offspring.&rdquo; This indicates that man&rsquo;s life and existence and even his actions are of God. This does not mean that in creation man has God&rsquo;s life and nature and lives, exists, and acts in God as do the regenerated believers in Christ, who are born of God, possess His life and nature, and live, exist, and act in God&rsquo;s person. Rather, this verse is saying that all human beings live, move, and exist in God.</p>
<p>According to the poets referred to in Acts 17:28, we are God&rsquo;s offspring. Mankind is God&rsquo;s offspring just as Adam was supposed to be the son of God (Luke 3:38). To say that Adam was a son of God does not mean that he was born of God and possessed the life and nature of God. Adam was created by God (Gen. 5:1-2), and God was his origin. Based upon this, he was supposed to be the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God. They were only created by God, not regenerated of Him. This is absolutely and intrinsically different from the believers in Christ being the sons of God. The believers have been born of God to have God&rsquo;s life and nature (John 1:12-13; 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:4). Because God is the Creator, the source of all men, He is the Father of them all (Mal. 2:10) in a natural sense, not in the spiritual sense as He is the Father of all the believers (Gal. 4:6), who are regenerated by Him in their spirit (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:5-6).</p>
<p>All human beings have been produced by God through creation and have a human life and nature. To be produced by God is one thing, and to be born of God is another thing. All human beings are the offspring of God in the sense of being produced by God. But the believers are sons of God in the sense of having been born of Him. There is no indication in the Bible that the offspring of God, the human beings produced by God, have the divine nature. But the New Testament reveals that the believers, who have been born of God, are partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Therefore, we must differentiate between the offspring of God and the sons of God. All human beings are the offspring of God produced by Him, but the believers are the sons of God born of Him through regeneration. Whereas the believers in Christ have the divine life and nature through regeneration, mankind in general has only a human life and a human nature through God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. A Pure Nature without Any Mixture</h2>
<p>The human nature created by God is a pure nature without any mixture. In the sight of God, the man created by Him was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (Gen. 1:31) and &ldquo;upright&rdquo; (Eccl. 7:29). Therefore, the created nature of man was originally good and upright.</p>
<p>In Romans 7:21 Paul speaks of his &ldquo;willing to do the good.&rdquo; This desire to do the good is related to the law of the mind (Rom. 7:23), which gives us this desire and therefore may be called the law of good in our mind. The law of good in the mind is derived from the good created life, which was obtained at the time of creation. This explains why, even before we were saved, there was in our mind a natural inclination to do good, to honor our parents, to be kind to others, and to improve ourselves. This indicates that in God&rsquo;s creation there is in man&rsquo;s soul an element of goodness, an element that naturally belongs to our good created nature. This nature was created by God pure, and thus it was not mixed with anything evil.</p><h2 class="head1">B. IN THE FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. A Fallen Human Nature</h2>
<p>Whereas in God&rsquo;s creation we have a good human nature, in the fall we have a fallen human nature. Although man was created good, the evil nature of Satan was injected into his body when he partook of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. The body was then changed in nature, having the nature of the tree of knowledge, the element of Satan, injected into it, making it the flesh. As originally created by God, the human body was a pure vessel containing one element, the element created by God. As a result of man&rsquo;s eating of the fruit of knowledge, a foreign element was injected into man&rsquo;s body and transmuted it into the flesh. The body which was once pure and sinless now contains the evil element of Satan. According to Romans 7, this element is the indwelling sin that makes its home in man&rsquo;s flesh (v. 17). For this reason, in Romans 7:18 Paul declares, &ldquo;I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; denotes the fallen and corrupted human body with all its lusts.</p>
<p>If we would be clear concerning the truth about our fallen human nature, we need to read Romans 7:18 very carefully. When Paul says in this verse that there is nothing good within us, he is referring to the condition in our flesh. According to the context of verses 21, 23, and 24, the flesh here refers to our fallen and transmuted body. In our fallen and transmuted body, that is, in our flesh, nothing good dwells. This does not mean, however, that there is no good thing at all in us as fallen beings. On the contrary, we are clearly told in Romans 7 that within us there is a will that desires to do good and that there is a law of good in our mind. Within us fallen human beings there is still the element of goodness and the law that naturally causes us to desire to do good. Although we have been damaged by Satan, this element of goodness remains. It is a fact that the element of goodness created in man has been corrupted by Satan, but it has not been corrupted to the point of nonexistence. This is the reason Paul does not say in 7:18 that there is nothing good in him; he says that there is nothing good in his flesh. We must pay careful attention to the modifier used here&mdash;&ldquo;in my flesh.&rdquo; We should not say that there is nothing good in us, for there is good within us. However, in our flesh, in our fallen body, nothing good dwells. In our fallen body, which the Bible calls &ldquo;flesh,&rdquo; sin dwells with all its lusts. Thus, nothing good is found in our flesh.</p>
<p>From a careful reading of Romans 7 we see that, on the one hand, in the members of our fallen body, the flesh, nothing good dwells, and that, on the other hand, the element of our good human nature created by God is still in us. Man was created by God as good, and some amount of goodness remains in us all. For example, if metal is cast into dirt, the metal may be defiled, but its nature is still that of metal. It would be a mistake to say that the metal is no longer metal. The principle is the same with man in God&rsquo;s creation and in the fall. Man was created by God, and God did not create anything that was not good. Everything created by God, including man as God&rsquo;s creature, was good. No matter how fallen man has become, the goodness of the human nature created by God remains in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. A Sinful Nature<br />
Mixed with the Satanic Nature</h2>
<p>In the fall man has not only a fallen human nature but also a sinful nature mixed with the satanic nature. As a result of the fall, we have been constituted sinners (Rom. 5:19). In order for a substance to be constituted in a certain way, a particular element must be added to it. By God&rsquo;s creation, we were good, righteous people. However, due to the fall of Adam, sin was injected into our being and constituted us sinners. Sin has been wrought into us and constituted into our being. Therefore, sin is not merely an outward deed&mdash;it is an inward, subjective element in our constitution.</p>
<p>When man fell, he did not only make a mistake and do something wrong. In the fall something more serious than a mistake occurred: sin was injected into man&rsquo;s being. We may think that Adam merely disobeyed God and made a mistake in taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge. We need to realize that when Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, something evil, and even satanic, entered into him. Through man&rsquo;s fall an evil, satanic element was injected into mankind. The Bible calls this element sin, and sin is the very nature of Satan, the evil one. In Romans 5 through 8 there are many indications that sin is like a living person: it entered (5:12), it reigns (5:21), it can lord it over us (6:14), it deceives us (7:11), it kills us (7:11), and it dwells in us (7:17). Once sin, the evil element of Satan, was injected into man, man was constituted a sinner. Now instead of being proper human beings, we are sinners by constitution.</p>
<p>As those who have been constituted sinners, we now have the evil nature of Satan in us. This is what Paul describes as the sin that dwells in us and the evil that is present with us (Rom. 7:17, 20, 21). The Greek word translated &ldquo;the evil&rdquo; in Romans 7:21 is <em>kakos,</em> a word denoting that which is evil in character. This must refer to the evil character of Satan himself. Because we have the nature of sin, the evil nature of Satan, within us, we have been constituted sinners.</p>
<p>Because fallen men have a sinful nature mixed with the satanic nature, they are children of the Devil. &ldquo;In this the children of God and the children of the Devil are manifest&rdquo; (1 John 3:10). As fallen descendants of Adam, we were born children of the Devil and thereby partook of his evil nature. Sin is the very nature of the Devil. This satanic nature is mixed with the sinful nature of fallen human beings.</p>
<p>Because we were born of the Devil, we have his evil nature. The sins we commit are the outward expression of this nature. Sin is an act that expresses the devilish nature. It is an issue of the devilish nature within us.</p>
<p>John 8:44 also indicates that fallen people have the satanic nature: &ldquo;You are of your father the Devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it.&rdquo; The Devil is the source of sin, and sin, the nature of the Devil, is a lie. Sin is a lie, a falsehood. Hence, everything sinful is unreal. The issue of the lie is death and darkness which, as falsehoods, are opposed to reality. The evil element of the Devil, working as sin by death and darkness within fallen man, enslaves man to sin. The Devil&rsquo;s nature is a lie and brings in death and darkness.</p>
<p>The Devil, an evil father, has brought forth children with a sinful nature mixed with the satanic nature. For this reason sinners are called children of the Devil. Furthermore, in the sight of God we, in our fallen nature, are not merely sinful&mdash;we are serpentine. The Devil is the old serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), and sinners also are serpents, the offspring of vipers. This means that in our fallen nature we, children of the old serpent, the Devil, are serpentine. For this reason, Matthew 3:7 uses the expression &ldquo;brood of vipers.&rdquo; In Matthew 12:34 the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees a brood of vipers. In Matthew 23:33 He called them &ldquo;serpents, brood of vipers,&rdquo; the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents. Therefore, the being of fallen man is serpentine. As fallen human beings, we have a serpentine nature. Therefore, we need to realize that, in the sight of God, we in our fallen nature are serpents full of the poison of the Devil. It is a fact that we all are serpentine, for we have been &ldquo;bitten&rdquo; by that poisonous old serpent. This is the nature of the believers in the fall.</p><h2 class="head1">C. IN GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. A Purified (Renewed) Nature</h2>
<p>We praise the Lord that, as believers in Christ, we have been brought into a third stage&mdash;the stage of God&rsquo;s salvation. In God&rsquo;s salvation the believers have a purified (renewed) nature. According to Titus 3:5, the believers have a purified nature &ldquo;through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; here (a word different from that for &ldquo;born again&rdquo; in 1 Peter 1:23) refers to a change from one state of things to another. To be born again is the beginning of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation to make us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, remodeling with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3, 5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process.</p>
<p>The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&mdash;the divine essence of the new man&mdash;into our being. The Holy Spirit washes and renews us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature to be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God. In this process of washing and renewing there is a passage from the old state we were in into a holy new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us throughout our whole life until the completion of the new creation. The point we are emphasizing here is that the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit cause us to have a purified, renewed, nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. A Nature Mingled with the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation the believers also have a nature mingled with the divine nature. Second Peter 1:4 indicates this: &ldquo;He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises, that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature.&rdquo; We, the believers in Christ, have become partakers of the divine nature in an organic union with Him. We have entered into this union through faith and baptism (John 3:15; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19). The virtue of the divine nature will carry us into God&rsquo;s glory, into the full expression of the Triune God. Now, as partakers of the divine nature, we are partakers of the elements, the ingredients, of God&rsquo;s being. When we partake of God, the aspects of what God is become our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The divine nature denotes what God is, that is, the constituents of God&rsquo;s being. According to the New Testament, God is Spirit (John 4:24), love (1 John 4:8, 16), and light (1 John 1:5). The expressions, &ldquo;God is Spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God is light,&rdquo; denote and describe the nature of God. In His nature God is Spirit, love, and light.</p>
<p>Spirit denotes the nature of God&rsquo;s person; love, the nature of God&rsquo;s essence; and light, the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which life is of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit, and Spirit is life. Within such a life are love and light. The divine nature, therefore, is a constitution of three items&mdash;Spirit, love, and light. To be a partaker of the divine nature is to be one partaking of God as Spirit, love, and light.</p>
<p>God is a person who has His essence and expression. The divine nature is the nature of God&rsquo;s person, the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, and the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. Therefore, Spirit, love, and light are the constituents of the divine nature. To partake of the divine nature is to partake of the divine Spirit, the divine love, and the divine light. According to the New Testament economy, God is now dispensing Himself into us. Surely what God dispenses into us is what He is in His nature. When God is dispensed into us, His nature is also dispensed into us. Since God is dispensing Himself into us with what He is in His nature and since His nature includes Spirit as the nature of God&rsquo;s person, love as the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, and light as the nature of God&rsquo;s expression, the more we are under God&rsquo;s dispensing, the more we have of His Spirit, love, and light. Through this dispensing we enjoy the constituents of the divine nature.</p>
<p>Because the divine nature is dispensed into us for our enjoyment, we now have a nature mingled with the divine nature. This means that in the believers the purified human nature and the divine nature are not separate but are mingled to form a compound nature. This mingling may be illustrated by the grafting of the branch of one tree into another tree. As a result of grafting, the natures of the two trees become one mingled nature. In God&rsquo;s salvation the human nature is purified, renewed, and mingled with the divine nature.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PAST</h1>
<p>In the two preceding messages we covered the believers&rsquo; life and nature. Now in this message we shall consider the believers&rsquo; past both in eternity and in time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A. IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>As believers, we have a very long history. In fact, we have an eternal history, for our history began in eternity past. In eternity we were foreknown by God, chosen by God, and predestinated by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. Foreknown by God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">a. According to the Foreknowledge of God</h2>
<p>Romans 8:29a refers to the believers as those whom God foreknew. In eternity God foreknew us according to His foreknowledge (1 Pet. 1:2a). In the New Testament the root of the words &ldquo;foreknowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreknow&rdquo; is &ldquo;know.&rdquo; To this root a prefix is attached. The Greek prefix <em>pro</em> means before or beforehand. In New Testament Greek, words such as foreknow and foreknowledge imply more than what we would understand from the English translations. The Greek root for these words includes the meaning of appreciation, approval, and possession. If we approve something, we shall appreciate it. Then we shall want to take possession of it and own it. The foreknowledge of God spoken of in 1 Peter 1:2 implies that in eternity past God approved us and appreciated us. It also implies that in eternity past He took us over, possessed us, owned us. We may even say that as Joseph married Mary, God in His foreknowledge &ldquo;married&rdquo; us in eternity past. (There is no time element with God.) All this is included in the connotation of the word foreknowledge.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s foreknowledge also includes His foreordination. In his expanded translation of the New Testament, Kenneth S. Wuest uses the word &ldquo;foreordination&rdquo; in 1:2, saying that the believers are &ldquo;chosen-out ones, this choice having been determined by the foreordination of God the Father.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us. We all were ordained by God the Father in eternity past.</p>
<p>b. According to God&rsquo;s Good Pleasure<br />
Which He Purposed in Himself</p>
<p>In eternity past we were foreknown by God &ldquo;according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself&rdquo; (Eph. 1:9). God&rsquo;s good pleasure is the desire of His heart. The book of Ephesians speaks from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s good pleasure, the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. According to 1:9, God&rsquo;s good pleasure is what He has purposed in Himself. In human terms, God&rsquo;s good pleasure is what makes Him happy. There is something in God&rsquo;s heart that pleases Him and makes Him happy. This is God&rsquo;s good pleasure.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s good pleasure has been purposed by God in Himself. This means that God Himself is the initiation, origin, and sphere of His purpose. God has a plan, a desire, and according to His plan He has a purpose. The existence of the universe is according to God&rsquo;s purpose. Heaven, earth, millions of items, and the human race are all according to God&rsquo;s purposed desire. Eventually all these things will issue in God&rsquo;s desire. In the universe there is a desire, God&rsquo;s desire. Because this desire has been purposed by God, no one and nothing can overthrow it. Everything that takes place on earth is for this purpose. We, the believers in Christ, are the focal point of His purpose, and everything is working for us. God has purposed this desire in Himself. He did not take counsel with anyone else regarding it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Chosen by God the Father</h2>
<p>In eternity past we were chosen by God the Father. &ldquo;He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love&rdquo; (Eph. 1:4). God&rsquo;s choosing is His selection. From among innumerable people God selected us. The word &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; implies that some were selected and that others were not selected. We praise the Lord that we are among the chosen ones.</p>
<p>The fact that we were chosen in eternity means that our salvation began in eternity, that it began before creation and before time. If we turn to our spirit and contact the Lord regarding this matter, we shall realize that just as God is eternal, so His choosing of us is also related to eternity. We all need to thank God the Father for His eternal selection, the selection made in eternity past for eternity future.</p><h2 class="head3">a. Before the Foundation of the World</h2>
<p>We were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world. God chose us according to His infinite foresight before He created us. The expression, &ldquo;before the foundation of the world,&rdquo; implies the entire universe, not only the earth. This indicates that the universe was founded for man&rsquo;s existence to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Without such a universe, it would be impossible for man to exist. Man&rsquo;s existence is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Therefore, the universe was founded so that man could exist to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. God chose us before the foundation of the world, that is, before the creation of the universe. This indicates that God&rsquo;s selection was made not in time but in eternity. God foresaw us before we were born and selected us before the foundation of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. In Christ</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:4 we also see that God in eternity chose us in Christ. Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God. Outside of Christ we are not God&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. That They Should Be Holy<br />
and without Blemish before Him</h2>
<p>God chose us so that we should be holy and without blemish before Him. To be holy is to be separated from everything other than God. It means to be distinct, different, from all that is not God. In the universe God alone is holy. He is different from everything else and is distinct. Therefore, to be holy means to be one with God.</p>
<p>In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally. Normally, once a person is saved, he should also be separated. This is the reason a believer is called a saint. To be holy in the sense of being separated unto God is a matter of position. As believers in Christ, we are separated unto God by the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14), by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 1:2; Rom. 15:16), and in the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>To be holy means not only to be separated unto God positionally but also to be saturated with God dispositionally. This is deeper and more subjective than positional sanctification. In subjective sanctification we are saturated with God dispositionally. Separation can take place rather easily and in a very short time, but it takes a long time to be saturated with God dispositionally. God intends to saturate us with Himself, a process that requires time. He chose us in eternity for the purpose of saturating us with Himself. He wants to work Himself into our being so that we may be holy, just as He is.</p>
<p>All believers have been chosen by God the Father to be holy. First, we are separated unto God; second, we are saturated with God; and eventually we become one with God. One day, we shall be just like Him. That will mark the completion of our sanctification, the process that begins with separation, continues with saturation, and is completed with the full redemption of our body. At that time, from within to without, we shall be the same as He is. We shall be holy. It is for this purpose that we were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:4 also says that we were chosen by God to be without blemish. A blemish is like a foreign particle in a precious gem. God&rsquo;s chosen ones should be saturated only with God Himself and have no foreign particles, such as the fallen natural human element, the flesh, the self, or worldly things. This is to be without blemish, to be without mixture, to have no element other than God&rsquo;s holy nature. God has chosen us to be so holy and so pure that we shall be without blemish, without any foreign particles, having only the divine element.</p>
<p>We shall be holy and without blemish &ldquo;before Him.&rdquo; This means that we shall be holy and without blemish in the sight of God according to His standard. This qualifies us to remain in His presence and to enjoy His presence. We shall be holy and without blemish not according to our standard or in our own sight, but according to God&rsquo;s standard and in His sight.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. Predestinated by God the Father</h2>
<p>In eternity we were also predestinated by God the Father (Rom. 8:29b; Eph. 1:4b, 5). The Greek word translated &ldquo;predestinated&rdquo; in Ephesians 1:5 can also be rendered &ldquo;marked out beforehand.&rdquo; Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand. God first selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny.</p>
<p>We all need to have the realization that we have been marked out by God for the accomplishment of His economy. Because God has put His mark on us, we cannot run away from Him. We were marked out by God before we were born, even before the foundation of the world. Since we have been pre-marked, we have no choice except to give ourselves to the Lord for His recovery and even to be beside ourselves for the church life.</p>
<p>Other human beings cannot see God&rsquo;s mark on us, but all the beings in the spiritual world can see it. The angels, the demons, and Satan himself know that we have been marked out by God. This mark is not merely outward but something very inward. We are a selected and marked-out people. This was accomplished by God in eternity past.</p>
<p>Because we were marked out by God in eternity, we have been saved. One day we believed in the Lord Jesus. It may have been that seemingly we believed in Him for no reason. The reason we came to believe in Christ is that we were predestinated, marked out beforehand, by God the Father.</p><h2 class="head3">a. In Love</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In love&rdquo; in Ephesians 1:4 may modify &ldquo;having predestinated&rdquo; in verse 5. God the Father predestinated us in love that we may be His many sons. The divine love is His motive to have many sons for the fulfillment of His divine economy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Unto Sonship</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 reveals that God predestinated us unto sonship. This means that the goal of God&rsquo;s predestination is sonship. Because we were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created, we, as God&rsquo;s creatures, need to be regenerated by Him so that we may share in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies both life and the position of a son. God&rsquo;s marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and also the position to inherit Him.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 1:4, God chose us to be holy. However, to be holy is the procedure, not the goal. The goal is sonship. God has chosen us to be holy so that we may be His sons. Therefore, to be holy is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the goal. God does not merely want a group of holy people; He desires many sons. God has chosen us to be holy for a purpose, and this purpose is that we may be sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. Through Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 also tells us that we have been predestinated unto sonship through Jesus Christ. &ldquo;Through Jesus Christ&rdquo; means through the Redeemer, who is the Son of God. Through Him we were redeemed to be the sons of God with the life and position of God&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. According to the Good Pleasure of His Will</h2>
<p>Finally, we were predestinated unto sonship by God the Father according to the good pleasure of His will. God has a will in which is His good pleasure. God predestinated us to be His sons according to this pleasure, according to His heart&rsquo;s delight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">B. IN TIME</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. Created by God</h2>
<p>After we were foreknown, chosen, and predestinated by God in eternity, we were created by Him in time. Acts 17:26a says, &ldquo;He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. This indicates that in the universe there are three important matters: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. Therefore, man is the center of the universe, and the center of man is his spirit. As far as God is concerned, if there were no spirit within man, man would be an empty shell. If there were no man on earth, the earth would be void and the heavens would be useless. In God&rsquo;s creation, the heavens serve the earth, the earth serves man, and man has a spirit to receive God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. Through Christ</h2>
<p>We were created by God through Christ (John 1:3). All believers realize that we have been saved through Christ. We also need to see that we were created through Christ. Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of mankind was processed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. In the Image of God</h2>
<p>Through Christ we were created by God in His image (Rom. 5:14b; 2 Cor. 4:4b). Strictly speaking, the image of God is Christ. Second Corinthians 4:4 speaks of Christ as the image of God. For man to be created in God&rsquo;s image, which is Christ, means that we were created not only through Christ but according to Christ. God&rsquo;s intention in creating us in this way was that one day Christ, according to whom we were created and through whom we were created, would come into our being. This means that, having been created in the image of God, we were created as vessels to contain Christ. Hence, we were created through Christ and according to Christ that we might contain Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Fallen</h2>
<p>In time we were not only created but also became fallen. Romans 5:12 says, &ldquo;As through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. In Adam</h2>
<p>Within every fallen person there are two striking things. The first is that we are in Adam and have the Adamic nature. In the sight of God there are only two men&mdash;Adam and Christ. All fallen ones are in Adam. Furthermore, those who are in Adam are part of Adam.</p>
<p>In Adam there are three main things: sin, death, and being constituted sinners (Rom. 5:19). In Adam we inherited death, we were under the reign of death (Rom. 5:12, 14), and we were constituted sinners.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Of Sin</h2>
<p>The second striking matter concerning mankind in the fall is that all fallen people are of sin. Through the disobedience of Adam, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into mankind. After entering into the human race, sin made its dwelling place in the fallen body of man (Rom. 7:17, 18, 21, 23). Because the element of sin was injected into man, fallen man is now of sin, that is, a constitution of sin. For this reason fallen people are sinners by constitution. This means that in the fall we are sinners by nature.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Dead in Offenses and Sins</h2>
<p>In time we were not only created by God and then became fallen; we also became dead in offenses and sins. Ephesians 2:1 reveals that in the past we were dead in our offenses and sins, and 2:5 says that &ldquo;we were dead in offenses.&rdquo; Furthermore, Colossians 2:13 says that we were dead in the offenses and the uncircumcision of our flesh. Offenses are acts which overstep the limit of right, and sins are evil doings. Before we were saved, we were dead in such offenses and sins. The word &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13 refers to the death of our spirit that pervades our entire being. Through Adam&rsquo;s transgression sin entered into the world and death through sin. Now death reigns over all men (Rom. 5:14, 17). Therefore, &ldquo;in Adam all die&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<p>In eternity we were foreknown, chosen, and predestinated by God. Then in time we were created by God. However, we became fallen and eventually became dead in offenses and sins. This was our situation in the past.</p>
<p>By being dead in offenses and sins, we lost the function that enables us to contact God. Spiritual death has annulled the function of our spirit. No matter how active we were in our body and soul, we were deadened in our spirit, unable to contact God.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>We have covered the believers&rsquo; status, designations, symbols, life, nature, and past. Now we come to the most crucial section of these messages on the believers&mdash;their present. We shall begin with the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A. IN THE INITIAL STAGE<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S FULL SALVATION,<br />
THE STAGE OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s full salvation is in three stages: the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage. The first aspect of the initial stage is that the believers experience God&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. Called</h2>
<p>If we would understand what God&rsquo;s calling is, we need to realize that it is included in the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, that is, in the stage of regeneration. God begins to save us by calling us. In eternity God foreknew us, chose us, and predestinated us. Then in time He created us. In time we also became fallen. Then God came in to save us, and the first thing in His salvation is that He calls us. This means that the One who foreknew us, chose us, and predestinated us before the foundation of the world, one day came to visit us. In His visitation He may have caused us to think about salvation. Our thinking concerning salvation was not initiated by us but by the calling God. Our thinking about salvation is a sign of God&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. By God</h2>
<p>The believers are called by God Himself. This means that God&rsquo;s calling is not originated or initiated by the called ones. It is initiated by God, the One who calls. God is the Originator of His calling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. According to God&rsquo;s Predestination</h2>
<p>Romans 8:30a says, &ldquo;Whom He predestinated, these He also called.&rdquo; This indicates that we were called by God according to His predestination. God is eternal and purposeful, and no one can change Him. We cannot cause Him to change His mind concerning His purpose. According to His purpose, He predestinated us in eternity past, and eventually He will come to us and gain us. Because God&rsquo;s calling is according to His predestination, we cannot escape His calling. God calls every one whom He has predestinated.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. According to God&rsquo;s Purpose&mdash;Plan</h2>
<p>The believers are called by God according to His purpose. Romans 8:28b speaks of &ldquo;those who are called according to the purpose.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; is equal to a plan. God&rsquo;s purpose is His plan. The purpose of God&rsquo;s calling is revealed in Romans 8:29: &ldquo;Whom He foreknew. He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s firstborn Son is the prototype, and we are the mass production. Christ is the model, the mold, and the pattern. God has put us all into Him that we may be molded into the image of His firstborn Son. Eventually we all shall be conformed to the mold. We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers. This is God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son. When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son. In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers. He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons. The purpose of this is that we express God in a corporate way. God&rsquo;s house is built up with His many sons for His kingdom, and the Body of Christ is built up with His many brothers. Without the many sons God cannot have a house for His kingdom, and without the many brothers Christ cannot have a Body. Thus, the many sons of God are for the house of God and then for the kingdom of God, and the many brothers of Christ are for the Body of Christ. The kingdom of God is actually the Body life, and this Body life in the church is God&rsquo;s kingdom where He is expressed and where His dominion is exercised on earth. This is the purpose according to which God has called us.</p>
<p>Another verse which reveals that we have been called by God according to His purpose is 2 Timothy 1:9: &ldquo;Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose....&rdquo; God has called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular cause, to fulfill His purpose. The purpose here is God&rsquo;s plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony.</p><h2 class="head3">d. According to God&rsquo;s Grace<br />
Given to Them in Christ before Times Eternal,<br />
but Manifested through the Appearing<br />
of Their Savior Christ Jesus</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 1:9 and 10 tell us that God called us also according to His grace, &ldquo;which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s grace is a matter of tremendous significance. In 1:9 grace is God&rsquo;s provision in life for us to live out His purpose. The New Testament reveals that grace is actually what God is to us for our enjoyment (John 1:16-17; 2 Cor. 12:9). Grace is God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience. Grace is not mainly the work God does for us; grace is the Triune God Himself dispensed into our being and experienced as our enjoyment. In brief, grace is the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, grace is nothing less than God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment. When God becomes our portion for us to enjoy, that is grace. Do not consider grace as something less than God. Grace is nothing less than the Triune God enjoyed by us in a practical way as our portion.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:9 Paul says that the grace given to us in Christ was bestowed upon us before the world began. The phrase &ldquo;before times eternal&rdquo; means before the world began. This is a sure and unshakable foundation, standing firmly against the waves of the downward current and exposing the total powerlessness of the enemy&rsquo;s efforts to counter the eternal purpose of God.</p>
<p>In verse 10 Paul goes on to say that the grace given to us before times eternal has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. God&rsquo;s grace was given to us in eternity but was manifested and applied to us through our Lord&rsquo;s first coming to nullify death and bring life to us. Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, the Old Testament saints did not experience it. The grace destined to be given to us came with the appearing of the Lord Jesus. This grace is not merely a blessing; it is the Triune God Himself given to us to be our enjoyment. This grace came when the Lord Jesus appeared, and now it is with us today. We have been called by God according to such a marvelous grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. Through His Own Glory and Virtue</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:3b says that the believers have been called by God &ldquo;to His own glory and virtue.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;to&rdquo; may also be rendered &ldquo;through&rdquo; or &ldquo;by.&rdquo; God has called us to His glory and virtue through His glory and virtue. His disciples saw His glory and virtue (2 Pet. 1:16; John 1:14) and were attracted by them. Then through this glory and virtue they were called by Him to this very glory and virtue. It is the same with all believers in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Glory as the Goal of the Divine Calling</h2>
<p>Glory is the expression of God, God expressed in splendor. This glory, God&rsquo;s expression, is the goal of the divine calling.</p>
<p>God has not called us without a goal. Whatever God does, He does with a definite goal. This is especially true in the matter of God&rsquo;s calling. Because God is a purposeful God, He called us with a goal, and this goal is to bring us into His glory. Therefore, God&rsquo;s glory is the goal of God&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Virtue as the Energy<br />
and Strength of Life to Reach the Goal</h2>
<p>Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; in 2 Peter 1:3 means excellency. Virtue denotes the energy of life to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all the excellent attributes listed in 2 Peter 1:5-7. Whereas glory is the divine goal, virtue is the energy and strength of life to reach the goal. Virtue is the excellent attributes of God becoming to us the energy of life. This means that we have the energy and strength to reach the goal of the divine glory. This virtue with all things relating to life has been given to us by the divine power (2 Pet. 1:3a), but it needs to be developed on the way to glory.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that in 2 Peter 1:3b virtue denotes the energy and strength of life for reaching God&rsquo;s goal. When God called us, He imparted His life into us, and this life is the highest virtue of God. God dispenses His life into us as a virtue. The divine life has the energy and the strength to enable us to reach the divine goal. Second Peter 1:3a says that God has given us all things pertaining to life. This involves God&rsquo;s virtue, which is the energy and strength for reaching the goal of God&rsquo;s calling. We cannot reach the goal of the divine glory by our own efforts. We can reach this goal only by the divine life and by all things pertaining to the divine life that have been given to us by God. Because we have such &ldquo;capital&rdquo; within us, we have the energy and strength to reach our goal of God&rsquo;s glory. Here we see the goal and the virtue through which God has called us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling includes His own glory and virtue. Virtue as the energy and strength of life comes from what God is. In the divine dispensing, what God is, is given to us by God to be our virtue. God has given the divine life, including all things pertaining to this life, to us as a virtue. Because this virtue energizes us and strengthens us, we have the ability to pass through the long process to reach God&rsquo;s glory as the goal of His calling.</p><h2 class="head3">f. In Christ</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:10 tells us that God has called us in Christ. Apart from Christ, or outside of Christ, God will not do anything concerning us. Whatever God does with us, He does in Christ, that is, in Christ as the sphere and element. Christ is the sphere and element in which the believers have been called by God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">g. Through the Gospel</h2>
<p>Second Thessalonians 2:14 tells us that God has called us through the gospel. No one is called without hearing the gospel. The preaching of the gospel is the sounding of God&rsquo;s heavenly and eternal call. Whoever would listen to and believe in the gospel receives God&rsquo;s calling, which is the initiation of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">h. In Sanctification</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is also in sanctification. First Thessalonians 4:7 says, &ldquo;God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification.&rdquo; The Greek preposition translated &ldquo;for&rdquo; here, <em>epi</em>, means upon, on condition of. God has not called us on condition of uncleanness, but He has called us in sanctification. This indicates that we must always remain in sanctification. God&rsquo;s calling has nothing to do with uncleanness. His calling is in sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head3">i. With a Holy Calling</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:9 Paul tells us that God has called us with a holy calling. God&rsquo;s calling is to separate us and sanctify us unto Himself, making us holy unto God. Hence, it is a holy calling, a calling that separates us unto God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">j. With a Heavenly Calling</h2>
<p>Hebrews 3:1a indicates that, as believers in Christ, we have been called with a heavenly calling. The term &ldquo;heavenly calling&rdquo; stands in contrast with the earthly calling. In God&rsquo;s economy, in His full salvation, we have been called by God from the heavens, and we have been called to everything that is heavenly: the heavenly Christ (Heb. 1:3, 13; 4:14; 6:20; 7:26), the heavenly enrollment (12:23), the heavenly gift (6:4), the heavenly worship (8:5; 9:23-24), the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22), and the heavenly country (11:16). Therefore, our calling is a heavenly calling. As believers, we are partakers of such a heavenly calling.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) A Calling of the Divine Hope to Possess,<br />
Partake Of, and Enjoy the All-inclusive Christ,<br />
the Embodiment of the Processed Triune God,<br />
as Their Life and Inheritance</h2>
<p>The heavenly calling is a calling of the divine hope to possess, partake of, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, as the believers&rsquo; life and inheritance. The heavenly calling is of the divine hope, and the divine hope is to possess the all-inclusive Christ. Today the processed Triune God embodied in Christ is our life and inheritance. The heavenly calling is a calling to possess the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, as our life and inheritance.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:18 speaks of the hope of God&rsquo;s calling. Before we were saved, we had no hope (Eph. 2:12). Now, as God&rsquo;s called people, we are full of hope. Our hope is actually Christ Himself. Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory, and 1 Timothy 1:1 speaks of Jesus Christ being our hope. Our hope is singly and uniquely Christ. Every aspect of our hope is related to Him. The all-inclusive Christ is the hope of our calling. Furthermore, we have the &ldquo;one hope&rdquo; (Eph. 4:4), the hope that one day the Lord Jesus will come as our hope of glory and that through Him our body will be transfigured (Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p>Christ can be our hope of glory because He dwells in our spirit to be our life. According to Colossians 3:4, when Christ our life is manifested, we also shall be manifested with Him in glory. He will appear to be glorified in our redeemed and transfigured body (Rom. 8:23; 2 Thes. 1:10). When Christ comes, we shall be glorified in Him, and He will be glorified in us. This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body. This will cause our body to be transfigured and to become like His glorious body. At that time Christ will be glorified in us. This is Christ in us as the hope of glory.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:3b-4 reveals that, in God&rsquo;s calling, which is a heavenly calling, the Triune God is our inheritance. In verse 4 three words are used to describe our inheritance: incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading. &ldquo;Incorruptible&rdquo; refers to the substance, which is indestructible, not decaying; &ldquo;undefiled,&rdquo; to its purity, to its being unstained; &ldquo;unfading,&rdquo; to its beauty and glory, to its not withering. Our inheritance is divine and spiritual, altogether incorruptible. Furthermore, this inheritance cannot be defiled; nothing can make it unclean. Finally, it is unfading; its beauty and glory cannot wither. These are the excellent qualities of our eternal inheritance in life.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s threefold description of our inheritance is actually a description of the Triune God. The word incorruptible refers to the nature of this inheritance. This is God&rsquo;s nature, signified by gold. The word undefiled describes the condition of the inheritance. This condition is related to the sanctifying Spirit. The word unfading refers to the expression of this inheritance, which has unfading glory. The everlasting expression indicated by the word unfading is the Son as the expression of the Father&rsquo;s glory. Therefore, here we have the Father&rsquo;s incorruptible nature, the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying power to maintain the inheritance in an undefiled condition, to keep it holy, clean, and pure, and also the Son as the expression of the unfading glory. This reveals that our inheritance is the Triune God. We have been called with the hope of enjoying Him eternally as our inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) A Calling Worthy of the Walk in the Church,<br />
the Body of Christ, with the Triune God&rsquo;s Reality, Which Is the Unsearchable Riches<br />
and the Immeasurable Dimensions of Christ<br />
unto All the Fullness of God for God&rsquo;s Expression</h2>
<p>The heavenly calling is also a calling worthy of the walk in the church, the Body of Christ, with the Triune God&rsquo;s reality, which is the unsearchable riches and the immeasurable dimensions of Christ unto all the fullness of God for God&rsquo;s expression (Eph. 4:1; 3:21, 8b, 18, 19b; 4:2-6). The heavenly calling is a calling that is worthy of the walk in the church. To walk in the church we need such a calling. This means that the heavenly calling qualifies us to walk in the church, which is the Body of Christ. Such a walk is in the sphere of the Triune God&rsquo;s reality. We do not walk in the church life by our energy, holiness, or godliness. On the contrary, we walk in the church, in the Body, with the Triune God&rsquo;s reality. The Triune God&rsquo;s reality is what the Triune God is, that is, the unsearchable riches and immeasurable dimensions of Christ. We walk in the church with the unsearchable riches and immeasurable dimensions of Christ with the result of being the fullness of God for God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:1 speaks of a walk worthy of God&rsquo;s calling, a walk in the church, the Body of Christ. God&rsquo;s glory is wrought into the church and He is expressed through the church. This means that God is glorified in the church (3:21), Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, which include all that Christ is to us. The universal dimensions of Christ are described in 3:18: the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth. These dimensions are immeasurable. The unsearchable riches of Christ and the immeasurable dimensions of Christ constitute the Triune God&rsquo;s reality with which the believers are filled for God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>The fullness of God in 3:19 denotes the expression of God. The church is the fullness, the expression, of God in a corporate way. In the church God is expressed corporately through the Body, through the believers who have been filled with the Triune God&rsquo;s reality. The calling with which God has called us is worthy of the walk in the Body of Christ, the corporate expression of the Triune God.</p><h1 class="series"> THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of God&rsquo;s calling of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head3">k. Out of Darkness<br />
into God&rsquo;s Marvelous Light</h2>
<p>As believers, we have been called out of darkness into God&rsquo;s marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9b). Darkness is the expression and sphere of Satan in death. Light is the expression and sphere of God in life. God has called us, delivered us, out of Satan&rsquo;s death-realm of darkness into His life-realm of light (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>As light is the nature of God in His expression, so darkness is the nature of Satan in his evil works. Thank God that He has delivered us out of the satanic darkness into the divine light! The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us. This light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it (John 1:4-5). When we follow this light, we shall by no means walk in darkness (John 8:12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">l. Into the Fellowship of, the Participation in,<br />
the Enjoyment of, His Son Jesus Christ Our Lord, the All-inclusive Embodiment<br />
of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:9). &ldquo;Fellowship&rdquo; denotes the partaking of, the participation in, God&rsquo;s Son. To be called into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son actually means to be called into the participation and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. To be in this fellowship is to partake of, to participate in, to enjoy, the all-inclusive Christ. God has called us into such a fellowship that we may partake of Christ, participate in Him, and enjoy Him as our God-given portion. Furthermore, Christ Himself is actually the fellowship into which God has called us. To say that we have been called into the fellowship of Jesus Christ means that we have been called into Him.</p>
<p>This fellowship involves not only the oneness between us and the Triune God but also the oneness among all believers. It also implies enjoyment&mdash;our enjoyment of the Triune God, the Triune God&rsquo;s enjoyment of us, and also the enjoyment which the believers have with one another. In this fellowship we enjoy the Triune God, and the Triune God enjoys us. Moreover, we enjoy all the believers, and all the believers enjoy us. What a wonderful, universal, mutual enjoyment!</p>
<p>We have been called by God into something which is termed the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son. This fellowship is universal and mutual. The mutuality of this fellowship is not only between the believers and the Triune God but also among the believers themselves.</p>
<p>The New Testament illustrates this fellowship by a feast. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that a feast had been prepared and that people were invited to it (Matt. 22:1-3; Luke 14:16-17). We all have been invited to a marvelous feast. The enjoyment of the feast is a mutual enjoyment, a co-participation. Thus, in the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son we have enjoyment. This enjoyment, however, is corporate, not individualistic. As we enjoy this feast together, we have fellowship.</p>
<p>Some versions translate the Greek word for fellowship, <em>koinonia</em>, as communion. Fellowship definitely implies communion. This communion is a co-enjoyment, a co-participation.</p>
<p>Fellowship also includes communication. Whenever we feast with others, there is communication.</p>
<p>The fellowship unto which God has called us is the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This fellowship includes the Triune God. It is the fellowship of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ, the One who in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This all-inclusive One is our feast, and this feast is our fellowship. As those who have been called into this fellowship, we are now enjoying Christ by feasting on Him. Furthermore, we have communion and we are in communication with one another. This fellowship, this communion, is the church life.</p>
<p>The Greek word for fellowship implies oneness and also a mutual flowing among the believers. When we enjoy fellowship with one another, there is a flow among us. The flow, the current, we have in our spiritual fellowship involves both oneness and life. Our fellowship is a flow in oneness; it is an intercommunication among us as believers in Christ.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, fellowship describes the flowing both between us and the Lord and between us and one another. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In 1 John we have life (1:1-2) and then fellowship. There is a flow, a current, vertically between us and the Father and Son and horizontally between us and other believers. We praise the Lord that on earth today there is something called fellowship, a fellowship among the children of God and a fellowship of the children of God with the Triune God. According to 1 Corinthians 1:9, we all have been called by God into this fellowship.</p>
<p>Because we have been called into such a fellowship, we should not say that we are of a certain person, doctrine, or practice. God has not called us into the fellowship of persons, doctrines, and practices. We have been called uniquely into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son. This means that we have been called into the reality, the embodiment, of the Triune God. In this fellowship we enjoy the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>The book of 1 Corinthians unveils to us that the very Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called is all-inclusive. He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1:24, 30). He is our glory for our glorification (2:7), hence, the Lord of glory (2:8). He is the depths of God, the deep things of God (2:10). He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11). He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock (10:3-4). He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12). He is the firstfruit (15:20, 23), the second Man (15:47), and the last Adam (15:45). As such, He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45). This all-inclusive One has been given to us by God as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God. It is into the fellowship of such a One that we have been called by God. Such a fellowship must be unique because Christ is unique.</p>
<p>The fact that we have been called into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son means that we and Christ have become one. It also means that we enjoy Christ in all He is, and that He enjoys us and what we are. As a result, there is not only a mutual communication but a mutuality in every way. All that Christ is becomes ours, and all that we are becomes His. We have been called by God into such a mutuality between us and the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head3">m. To the Suffering of Christ</h2>
<p>We have seen that we have been called <em>into</em> God&rsquo;s marvelous light and <em>into</em> the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son. Now we need to see that we have also been called <em>to</em> the suffering of Christ. &ldquo;If doing good and suffering you shall endure, this is grace with God. For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:20b-21). God&rsquo;s calling includes not only enjoyment but also suffering. Our destiny in God&rsquo;s calling includes both the enjoyment of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God and also the suffering of Christ. We have been called to suffer with Christ, to suffer what He suffered.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:21 says, &ldquo;To this you were called.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;this&rdquo; refers to the unjust sufferings, the suffering for doing good, mentioned in verses 19 and 20. As the context indicates, some of the believers to whom this Epistle was written were called to suffer unjustly under crooked masters. We have been called to unjust suffering so that in it we may have the enjoyment of God as grace and express Him. Whatever the circumstances may be, God is our grace, our inner enjoyment. This enjoyment motivates us and then becomes our outward expression, an expression visible to others.</p>
<p>Verse 21 clearly reveals that we have been called to suffer unjustly because Christ suffered on our behalf and left us a model so that we should follow in His steps. Literally, the Greek word for &ldquo;model&rdquo; means a writing copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them. In ancient times teachers would write letters on writing material, and those letters became a master copy. Another piece of writing material was put upon the master copy. Then the children would practice writing by tracing the letters from the master copy onto their copy. The Greek word for model is the word that denotes such a master copy used in the teaching of writing. The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing and following His steps. To this we have been called by God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">n. To the Peace of Christ for His One Body</h2>
<p>The believers have also been called to the peace of Christ for His one Body. Colossians 3:15 says, &ldquo;Let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body.&rdquo; The relative pronoun &ldquo;which&rdquo; here refers to the peace of Christ. We were called to this peace in the one Body of Christ. For the proper Body life we need the peace of Christ to arbitrate, to adjust, to decide all things in our hearts in the relationships between the members of His Body. Our having been called to the peace of Christ should also motivate us to let this peace arbitrate in our hearts. We have been called into peace to maintain the one Body.</p>
<p>Within us we all have something called the peace of Christ. This is the peace about which Paul speaks in Ephesians 2:15, where we are told that in Himself Christ created one new man out of two peoples. By creating the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man, Christ has made peace. This is the peace in Colossians 3:15.</p>
<p>Believers with different cultural backgrounds and nationalities have been created into one new man. The oneness of the new man produces genuine peace. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are one because we are in Christ and in the church. We are in the new man, where there is no Greek, Jew, circumcision, or uncircumcision (Col. 3:11). In the new man there are no different races, classes, or nationalities. Rather, there is oneness because Christ is all and in all. This oneness is our peace. The peace of Christ in Colossians 3:15 is simply the peaceful oneness in the new man.</p>
<p>As fallen people, we were God&rsquo;s enemies, and there was no peace between us and God. Furthermore, there is no peace among the various peoples on earth, especially between the Jews and the Gentiles. On the cross Christ redeemed us, reconciled us to God, and made peace between us and God. Through His death on the cross Christ abolished the ordinances concerning the different ways of living so that there may be peace among the races and nations (Eph. 2:15-16). Because Christ has abolished the ordinances, He has made peace not only between us and God but between believers of different races and nationalities. Christ has broken down the middle wall of partition. Moreover, according to Ephesians 2:14, Christ Himself is our peace. With Christ as our Peacemaker, we have vertical peace&mdash;peace between us and God&mdash;and horizontal peace&mdash;peace with one another. Now the peace of Christ arbitrates in our hearts. This peace is actually Christ Himself. He is the peace that carries on a work of arbitration within us to keep us at peace with God and with one another for His one Body. We have been called to this peace.</p><h2 class="head3">o. Unto the Obtaining of the Glory<br />
of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>We have seen that God has called us to His own glory. He has also called us unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul says, &ldquo;To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Thes. 2:14). The words &ldquo;to which&rdquo; refer to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, as mentioned in verse 13. In eternity God chose us unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, and then in time He called us unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord. Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth are the procedures; obtaining the glory of our Lord is the goal.</p>
<p>First God chose us and then He called us. He chose us unto the belief of the truth and unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. Then through the gospel He called us unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. The glory of the Lord is that He is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father&rsquo;s life and nature to express Him. To obtain the Lord&rsquo;s glory is to be in the same position as sons of God to express Him.</p>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul does not say that God has called us unto the obtaining of forgiveness, justification, or reconciliation. He says that God has called us unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus. In John 17:22 the Lord said in His prayer to the Father, &ldquo;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&rdquo; The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature (John 5:26) to express the Father in His fullness (John 1:18; 14:9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). This glory the Son has given to His believers that they also may have the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature (John 17:2; 2 Pet. 1:4) to express the Father in the Son in His fullness (John 1:16). This means that the Son has given us the Father&rsquo;s life and nature that we may be able to express God the Father. God has called us unto the obtaining of this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the divine Being.</p>
<h2 class="head3">p. Into His Eternal Glory<br />
for the Expression of the God of All Grace</h2>
<p>As believers, we have also been called into God&rsquo;s eternal glory for the expression of the God of all grace. First Peter 5:10a speaks of &ldquo;the God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;all grace&rdquo; refers to the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects ministered to us in many steps of the divine operation on us and in us in God&rsquo;s economy. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us, as indicated by the words &ldquo;called you into His eternal glory.&rdquo; Between these two steps are God&rsquo;s loving care while He is disciplining us and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us. In all these divine acts the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences. We should be encouraged by the fact that our God is the God of all grace and that He has called us into eternal glory, a glory that is unlimited in both space and time.</p>
<p>Peter says that God has called us into His eternal glory in Christ. &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; indicates that the God of all grace has gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption so that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself. Thus they may participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us. It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain unto His glorious goal. What a miracle that fallen sinners can be brought into God&rsquo;s eternal glory, into His eternal expression! This is accomplished through His grace. Therefore, we are called into God&rsquo;s glory for the expression of the God of all grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">q. Into God&rsquo;s Own Kingdom and Glory</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 2:12 says, &ldquo;That you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s calling is according to His selection, and it follows His selection (1 Thes. 1:4). Through the salvation in Christ, we have been called into the kingdom of God, which is the sphere for us to worship God and enjoy Him under the divine ruling with the view of entering into God&rsquo;s glory. God&rsquo;s glory goes with His kingdom.</p>
<p>In 2:12 Paul tells us clearly that the Christian life has a goal and that this goal is the kingdom of God. We are moving toward this goal, this destination. Our destination, and also our destiny, is to enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom. The kingdom, a major subject in the New Testament, is the unique goal of our Christian walk. First Thessalonians 2:12 does not say that God has called us to heaven, but says that He has called us with the goal of entering into His kingdom. This kingdom involves God&rsquo;s glory. When we enter into the kingdom, we shall certainly be in glory. The kingdom of God with the glory of God is far more excellent than a so-called heavenly mansion.</p>
<p>Paul exhorts the believers in 2:12 to walk worthily of God. Walking worthily of God is related to entering into His kingdom and being ushered into His glory. We need to have a Christian walk that will enable us to enter into the kingdom of God, a walk that will usher us into God&rsquo;s glory. When we live God, we walk worthily of Him. Such a walk will lead us into the kingdom and usher us into the glory of God. This is the goal of God&rsquo;s calling. God has called us to enter His kingdom and glory.</p>
<h2 class="head3">r. For the Believers to Be Separated<br />
and Made Holy unto God,<br />
to Be the Holy Ones, the Saints</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is for the believers to be separated and made holy unto God, to be the holy ones, the saints. Romans 1:7 speaks of those who are &ldquo;called saints.&rdquo; The root of the Greek word for &ldquo;saints,&rdquo; <em>hagios,</em> means separated, set apart. Therefore, saints are the separated ones, the ones set apart to God. We have become saints through the calling of the sanctifying God. God&rsquo;s calling involves separation, and this separation is sanctification.</p>
<p>The expression &ldquo;called saints&rdquo; indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called <em>to be</em> saints (as in KJV). This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition.</p>
<p>Every saved one is a called one. To be called is to be saved. Once we were called, we became saints. To be called by God is to be separated unto His purpose. Because we have been called by God unto His purpose, separated unto Him for the fulfillment of His eternal plan, we are the called saints.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall see that, as part of their present, the believers have been sanctified by the Spirit and that they have repented.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Sanctified, Separated unto God,<br />
by the Spirit</h2>
<p>The believers are sanctified, separated unto God, by the Spirit (1 Pet. 1:2). The divine title &ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; signifies God reaching us to make us holy even as He is holy. The Holy Spirit separates us unto God for the purpose of making us holy. Therefore, following God&rsquo;s calling, the Spirit comes to sanctify us.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:2 speaks of &ldquo;the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In this verse sanctification of the Spirit is not the sanctification of the Spirit which comes after justification through the redemption of Christ. Here sanctification of the Spirit is before justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption (1 Cor. 6:11). This indicates that the believers&rsquo; obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work.</p>
<p>Concerning the sanctification of the Spirit, there are two aspects. The first aspect precedes justification. This aspect of sanctification carries out God&rsquo;s choice, His selection, and brings the chosen ones to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood for their justification. Thus, this aspect of the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification is before justification through the redemption of Christ. Then, following justification, the Spirit continues to work to sanctify us dispositionally. The sequence is this: God&rsquo;s selection, the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification, justification, and subjective sanctification.</p>
<p>In eternity past God, according to His foreknowledge, chose us. He selected us and made a decision to gain us. But how could this selection be applied to us? In order for it to be applied, there is the need for the Spirit to separate us unto God. Therefore, after God selected us in eternity, the Spirit came to us in time to sanctify us, to set us apart, from the world so that we would obey Christ&rsquo;s redemption. This means that the Spirit came to separate us for the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ. It is the sanctifying Spirit who separates us from the world unto the obedience of Christ&rsquo;s blood. First, we repent and believe, and then we obey what Christ has done on the cross. Following this, we receive the sprinkling of the blood of Christ. This is the sanctifying work of the Spirit following God&rsquo;s selection to carry out God&rsquo;s choice and to bring us to Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>We all can testify of this sanctifying work of the Spirit from our experience. We were wandering on earth, perhaps never having a thought about God. Then one day the &ldquo;wind&rdquo; of the Spirit &ldquo;blew&rdquo; us to a place where we heard the preaching of the gospel. While we were listening, faith was infused into us. In this way God&rsquo;s selection was applied to us. In this sense the sanctification of the Spirit preceded our experience of Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. Sought by the Enlightening of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit separates us unto God through seeking us by enlightening us. This enlightening of the Holy Spirit is illustrated by the second parable in Luke 15, the parable of the seeking woman. Luke 15:8 says, &ldquo;What woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully until she finds it?&rdquo; The lamp signifies the word of God (Psa. 119:105, 130) used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner&rsquo;s position and condition so that he may repent. The word &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; indicates the searching and cleansing of the inside of a sinner. The Spirit&rsquo;s seeking here is inside the sinner, carried out by the Spirit&rsquo;s working within the repenting sinner.</p>
<p>The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman seeks carefully one lost coin until she finds it. This means that the Spirit comes to find us out. After the accomplishment of redemption by the Son, the Spirit comes to seek us and find us by enlightening us.</p>
<p>As indicated by the parable of the seeking woman, the Spirit enlightens us inwardly. The Spirit seeks us by enlightening our inner being in a fine, careful way. As the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s enlightening, we are separated to God and we repent. The repentance resulting from the enlightening of the Spirit is an inward matter. Such a subjective work can be done only by the penetrating Spirit, for the Spirit is able to penetrate the depths of our being to enlighten us and expose us.</p><h2 class="head4">(1) To Open Their Eyes,<br />
to Turn Them from Darkness to Light,<br />
and from the Authority of Satan to God</h2>
<p>When we connect Acts 26:18a with Luke 15:8, we see that the enlightening of the Holy Spirit is to open people&rsquo;s eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God. The Spirit opens the believers&rsquo; eyes and turns them from darkness to light that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm. To see these things requires spiritual sight and divine light.</p>
<p>To turn from darkness to light is to have a transfer from darkness into light, and to turn from the authority of Satan to God is to be transferred out of the authority of Satan into God. Darkness is a sign of sin and death; light is a sign of righteousness and life (John 1:4; 8:12). The authority of Satan is Satan&rsquo;s kingdom (Matt. 12:26), which belongs to darkness. Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31) and the ruler of the power of the air (Eph. 2:2). He has his authority and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12). Hence, Satan has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>According to Acts 26:18a, we are transferred from the authority of Satan to God. Actually, to be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God&rsquo;s kingdom belonging to light. Formerly we were in darkness under the authority of Satan, but we have been transferred out of darkness and the authority of Satan into light and God.</p>
<p>Darkness is actually the authority of Satan. Whenever we are in darkness, we are under satanic authority. Light is God Himself (1 John 1:5). Therefore, when we are in the light, we are in God. Just as Satan and darkness are one, so God and light are one. The greatest transfer we can have is the transfer from darkness to light. When we are separated unto God by the Spirit, we experience such a transfer.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) To Enlighten Them That They May Repent</h2>
<p>The Spirit enlightens the believers that they may repent. Hebrews 6:4a speaks of both repentance and enlightenment. Only through the Spirit&rsquo;s work of enlightening us are we able to repent and turn to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Convicted by the Spirit<br />
concerning Sin (Related to Adam),<br />
concerning Righteousness (Related to Christ),<br />
and concerning Judgment (Related to Satan)</h2>
<p>The believers are those who have been convicted by the Spirit concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. John 16:8-11 says, &ldquo;Having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&rdquo; The Spirit always convicts people concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin (John 8:44). We were born of sin in Adam. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe in Christ, the Son of God. Because we believe in Him, He is righteousness to us, and we have been justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). Those who do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<p>The convicting work of the Spirit is related to Adam, Christ, and Satan. Sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan. We became fallen in Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have been justified. Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him. Satan, the source of death, has been judged and destroyed through Christ&rsquo;s death (Heb. 2:14). Whereas those who believe in Christ receive Him as their righteousness, those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan.</p>
<p>One day the Spirit came to us to separate us unto God by convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan. Through the convicting work of the Spirit we have been sanctified unto God.</p><h2 class="head2">3. Having Repented</h2>
<p>After we have been sanctified, separated unto God, by the Spirit, we repent. This is portrayed by the second and third parables in Luke 15. Verses 17 and 18a say, &ldquo;When he came to himself, he said, How many of my father&rsquo;s hired servants have an abundance of bread, but I am perishing here with famine! I will rise up and go to my father....&rdquo; The prodigal son&rsquo;s waking up was due to the enlightening of the Holy Spirit signified by the woman with the lamp. His repentance was produced by the Spirit&rsquo;s enlightenment. In our experience the Holy Spirit came to seek us and enlighten us and thereby separate us to God. This resulted in repentance, which is a change in our mind that produces a change in the direction of our life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. Having Had a Change of Mind,<br />
a Turn in Their Mind from the Things<br />
Other Than God to God and His Kingdom</h2>
<p>The believers have had a change of mind, a turn in their mind from the things other than God to God and His kingdom. In Matthew 3:2 John the Baptist declares, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; In Matthew 4:17 the Lord Jesus says the same thing. As used in these verses, the word &ldquo;repent&rdquo; literally means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. To repent before God is, on the negative side, to repent not only of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption that usurp and corrupt people whom God made for Himself and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in every thing for fulfilling His purpose in creating mankind. This is a &ldquo;repentance unto God&rdquo;; it is to &ldquo;repent and turn to God&rdquo; (Acts 20:21; 26:20). When we repented, we had not only a change of our mind but also a turn in our mind from everything other than God to God and His kingdom.</p>
<p>To repent is to have a change in our thinking, our philosophy, our logic. The life of fallen man is absolutely according to his thinking. Everything he is and does is according to his mind. Before we were saved, we were directed by our mind. Our mentality, logic, and philosophy governed our way of life, for we were under the direction of our fallen mind. We were far away from God, and our life was in direct opposition to His will. Under the influence of our fallen mentality, we went farther and farther astray from God. Then one day we heard the preaching of the gospel telling us to repent, to have a change and a turn in our thinking, philosophy, and logic.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, to repent is to turn not only to God Himself but also to His kingdom. In Matthew 3:2 and 4:17 John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus did not tell people to repent so that they may go to heaven or obtain salvation. They said to repent for the kingdom. The kingdom denotes God&rsquo;s reign, His rule. Before we were saved, we were not under God&rsquo;s rule. However, when we heard the preaching of the gospel, we turned to God&rsquo;s kingdom, to God&rsquo;s rule, and now we are in the kingdom of God. We have turned from all things other than God to God and His kingdom, placing ourselves under His ruling so that we may be in His kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Having Had an Actual Turn<br />
from All Things, Bad or Good, to God Himself</h2>
<p>When we repented, we had an actual turn from all things, bad or good, to God Himself. This is a turn not only in mind but also in activity, and it is a turn not only from bad things but also from good things. Because good things can be opposed to God, we must turn to Him even from such things. As believers in Christ, we have turned in actuality and in practicality to God Himself from all things.</p>
<p>Three verses that speak of turning to God in actuality are Acts 26:20; 14:15b; and 1 Thessalonians 1:9b. In Acts 26:20 Paul testified that he &ldquo;declared first to those in Damascus and also in Jerusalem and all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.&rdquo; In Acts 14:15b Paul and Barnabas told the people to &ldquo;turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;vain things&rdquo; refers to idols and idolatry. To repent, therefore, is to turn from idols to the living God, who created all things. The believers at Thessalonica made such a turn and Paul said to them, &ldquo;You turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God&rdquo; (1 Thes. 1:9). To turn to God from idols is not only to turn away from false gods, with the Devil and demons behind them, but also to turn away from all things other than God. This is by faith infused into the new converts through hearing the word of the gospel. To serve a living and true God is to serve the very God who is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;processed to be the believers&rsquo; life and life supply for their enjoyment. Having repented, that is, having actually turned to Him, they should now experience Him not only as the object of worship but also as the all-inclusive One who lives in them.</p><h2 class="head3">c. To Receive the Forgiveness of Sins,<br />
the Gift of the Holy Spirit,<br />
and the Divine Inheritance</h2>
<p>Repentance works in us in such a profound way that God gives us the forgiveness of sins, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the divine inheritance. Acts 2:38 says, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Forgiveness of sins is based on the redemption of Christ accomplished through His death (Acts 10:43; Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 15:3). It is the initial and basic blessing of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Based upon it, the blessing of God&rsquo;s full salvation goes forth and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The gift of the Holy Spirit is not any gift distributed by the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 12:6, 1 Corinthians 12:4, and 1 Peter 4:10; rather, it is the gift which is the Holy Spirit Himself, given by God to the believers in Christ as the unique gift that produces all the gifts mentioned in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and 1 Peter 4. The Holy Spirit in Acts 2:38 is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God in His New Testament economy, both essential for life and economical for power, given to the believers at the time of their repentance and believing in Christ (Eph. 1:13; Gal. 3:2) as the all-inclusive blessing of God&rsquo;s full gospel (Gal. 3:14), so that they may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).</p>
<p>Acts 26:18 speaks of having our eyes opened and of being turned from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God that we &ldquo;may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith&rdquo; in Christ. Here we see that the genuine forgiveness of sins comes through the opening of the eyes and the transfer from Satan to God. Therefore, we needed to have our eyes opened and to have a transfer from the authority of Satan to God in order to receive the complete and perfect forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>As the result of having our eyes opened and of being transferred from the authority of Satan to God, we not only have the forgiveness of sins on the negative side, but we also receive an inheritance on the positive side. This divine inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (Col. 1:12). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the seal, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:13-14), which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (1 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. According to the Divine Requirement<br />
for God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; repentance is according to the divine requirement for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Acts 26:20 indicates that everyone should repent and turn to God. In Acts 17:30b Paul says, &ldquo;God now charges all men everywhere to repent.&rdquo; In His New Testament economy God requires us to repent. Although He has &ldquo;overlooked the times of ignorance&rdquo; (Acts 17:30a), He now charges all people to repent. Repentance, therefore, is a crucial item in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. As a Gift Given by the Exalted Christ<br />
as a Leader and Savior</h2>
<p>Repentance is a gift given by the exalted Christ as a Leader and Savior. &ldquo;This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Acts 5:31). This clearly reveals that repentance is a gift given to us by the exalted Christ. To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God&rsquo;s chosen people required Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior. His sovereign ruling causes and leads God&rsquo;s chosen people to repent, and His salvation based upon His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins. Repentance is for forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). On God&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption (Eph. 1:7). On man&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is through repentance.</p>
<p>Repentance and forgiveness of sins are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and the Savior is qualified to give them. No one else is qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">f. As A Crucial Item of the Proclamation<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>Finally, repentance is a crucial item of the proclamation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In Luke 24 the resurrected Christ commissioned His disciples to preach repentance for the forgiveness of sins. After pointing out to them that it was written that Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day, He told them that &ldquo;repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things&rdquo; (vv. 47-48). Now that Christ&rsquo;s vicarious death for the sinners&rsquo; sins has been accomplished and has been verified by His resurrection (Rom. 4:25), repentance for forgiveness of sins needs to be proclaimed. Hence, in our preaching we must emphasize repentance, proclaiming repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>Concerning the believers&rsquo; present, we have seen God&rsquo;s calling, the Spirit&rsquo;s separation, and our repentance. Following God&rsquo;s calling, the Holy Spirit came to separate us, enlightening us and convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. Enlightening and convicting are the work of the Holy Spirit to separate us unto God in the initial stage of our salvation. As the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s work, we repented, and God gave us the forgiveness of sins, His Holy Spirit, and even Himself as our divine inheritance.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>Regarding the believers&rsquo; present, we have seen God&rsquo;s calling, the Spirit&rsquo;s separation, and our repentance. Repentance is followed by believing, and believing is followed by baptism. In this message and in the message following we shall seek to give a thorough definition of what it means for a Christian to believe in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. Having Believed</h2>
<h2 class="head3">a. Receiving Him Who Is the Word,<br />
the Very God, and the True Light,<br />
That Is, Believing into His Name<br />
(Denoting His Person)</h2>
<p>First, we have received Him who is the Word, the very God, and the true light; that is, we have believed into His name, which denotes His person. All this is revealed clearly in chapter one of the Gospel of John. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 9 tells us that this One is also the true light, &ldquo;which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.&rdquo; The Word is God Himself defined, explained, and expressed. The word &ldquo;enlightens&rdquo; refers to the inward enlightening which brings life to the ones who receive the Word. Verse 12 goes on to say, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name.&rdquo; This verse indicates that to believe is to receive. To believe into the Lord Jesus is to receive Him as the One who is the Word, God, and the true light.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Believing into the Son of God,<br />
Who Has the Eternal Life,<br />
and into the Son of Man,<br />
Who Was Lifted Up<br />
as the Brass Serpent on the Cross,<br />
to Have an Organic Union with Him</h2>
<p>The believers have believed into the Son of God, who has the eternal life, and into the Son of Man, who was lifted up as the brass serpent on the cross, to have an organic union with Him. John 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; This verse speaks of believing in the Son of God. The Greek preposition for &ldquo;in&rdquo; here actually means &ldquo;into&rdquo; and signifies union with Christ by believing into Him.</p>
<p>First John 5:11 tells us that eternal life is in the Son of God. The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives us the eternal life which is in the Son. The Son of God is the means for God to give us His eternal life. Because the life is in the Son (John 1:4) and the Son is the life (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4), the Son and the life are one. If we have the Son of God, we have eternal life, because eternal life is in the Son. Actually, eternal life is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, when we receive the Son of God by believing into Him, we have the eternal life that is in Him.</p>
<p>John 3:14 and 15 say, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; These verses speak of having eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, by believing into the Son of Man. Here the Lord Jesus applies to Himself the type of the brass serpent (Num. 21:4-9), showing that when He was in the flesh, He was in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3), which likeness was the form of the brass serpent. It had the form of the serpent but not the poison. Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He had no participation in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). When in the flesh He, the Son of Man, was lifted up on the cross, He dealt with Satan, the old serpent (John 12:31-33; Heb. 2:14). Now we may have eternal life by believing into Him. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;that&rdquo; at the beginning of John 3:15 is better translated &ldquo;so that&rdquo; or &ldquo;in order that.&rdquo; This indicates the goal of the lifting up of the Son of Man. The Son of Man was lifted up in order that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.</p>
<p>The issue of our believing into Christ as the Son of God and the Son of Man is that we have an organic union with Him. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we believe into Him. By believing into Him we enter into Him to be one with Him organically, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us. This means that by believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained. Therefore, by believing into Christ we have an organic union with Him and thereby become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the meaning of the expression &ldquo;organic union.&rdquo; By faith in the Son of God and the Son of Man we have been brought into an organic union with Him.</p><h2 class="head3">c. Believing into Christ Jesus<br />
to Be Justified with the Righteousness of God</h2>
<p>We have believed into Christ Jesus to be justified with the righteousness of God. Justification is God&rsquo;s action in approving us according to the standard of His righteousness. We may justify ourselves according to our standard of righteousness, but this does not enable us to be justified by God according to His standard. We need justification by faith. Justification by faith means that we are approved by God according to the standard of His righteousness. God can do this because our justification is based on the redemption of Christ. When Christ&rsquo;s redemption is applied to us, we are justified. If there were no such redemption, it would not be possible for us to be justified by God. Redemption is the basis of justification.</p>
<p>Acts 13:39 says, &ldquo;From all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;this One&rdquo; is the Lord Jesus, the One who has been resurrected to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son and our Savior. Through Him we are justified from all the things from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. Actually, the One by whom we are justified is Himself our justification. Today Christ in His resurrection is our justification. Hence, we should not regard justification as something apart from Christ.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:16 says, &ldquo;Knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus; we also have believed in Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by works of law, because by works of law no flesh shall be justified.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; here means fallen man who has become flesh (Gen. 6:3). No such man will be justified by works of law. Furthermore, in Galatians 3:11 Paul tells us, &ldquo;Now that by law no one is justified before God is evident.&rdquo; In these verses Paul tells us clearly that no one is justified by the works of law.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy we are justified by faith in Christ. We may be so familiar with the expression &ldquo;justified by faith in Christ&rdquo; that we take it for granted. Faith in Christ denotes an organic union through believing. The proper preaching of the gospel is the preaching not of a doctrine but of Christ, the Son of God, the One who is the embodiment of the Father and who is realized as the Spirit. The faith in Christ by which believers are justified is related to their appreciation of the Son of God. Actually, this appreciation is their faith in Christ. Out of their appreciation for the Lord Jesus they desire to possess Him. The Christ who has been preached to them will become in them the faith by which they believe. Therefore, faith is Christ preached into us to become our capacity to believe through our appreciation of Him.</p>
<p>This faith creates an organic union in which we and Christ are one. The expression &ldquo;by faith in Christ&rdquo; actually denotes an organic union accomplished by believing in Christ. The term &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; refers to this organic union. Before we believed in Christ there was a great separation between us and Christ. But through believing we have been joined to Christ and have become one with Him. Now we are in Christ, and Christ is in us. This is an organic union, a union in life.</p>
<p>It is by means of our organic union with Christ that God can reckon Christ as our righteousness. Because we and Christ are one, whatever belongs to Him is ours. This is the basis on which God counts Christ as our righteousness. Through the organic union with Christ, we share whatever Christ is and has. As soon as this union takes place, in the sight of God, Christ becomes us and we become one with Him. Only in this way can we be justified before God.</p>
<p>We should not have a mere doctrinal understanding of justification by faith. According to the concept of some Christians, Christ is the just One, the righteous One, on the throne in the presence of God, and God reckons Christ to be our righteousness when we believe in Christ. This understanding of justification is not adequate. In order to be justified by faith in Christ, we need to believe in Him out of an appreciation of Him. As the Lord Jesus is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, we spontaneously appreciate Him and call on Him. This is genuine believing. Through such a believing we and Christ become one. As a result, God reckons Christ as our righteousness.</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we had this kind of experience, although we did not have the terminology to explain it. First, we began to sense the Lord&rsquo;s preciousness. This gave rise to the faith that joined us to Christ organically. From that time onward, Christ and we became one in life and in reality. Therefore, justification by faith is not merely a matter of position but also an organic matter, a matter in life. The organic union with Christ is accomplished spontaneously through the living faith produced by our appreciation of Him. This is to be justified by faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 3:22 speaks of &ldquo;the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe.&rdquo; The righteousness of God is what God is with respect to justice and righteousness. God is just and right. Whatever God is in His justice and righteousness constitutes His righteousness. Furthermore, all that God is in His justice and righteousness is actually Himself. Therefore, the righteousness of God is not merely a divine attribute&mdash;it is God Himself.</p>
<p>Although we are justified with the righteousness of God, we, the justified ones, actually have Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). However, we may incorrectly think that we have the righteousness of Christ. Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself. Christ Himself as a person, not His attribute of righteousness, has been made the righteousness of God to us. God has made Christ, who is the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.</p>
<p>In Romans 1:17 Paul, speaking of the gospel, says, &ldquo;The righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith.&rdquo; The gospel is powerful (v. 16) because the righteousness of God is revealed in it. According to John 3:16 salvation is out of God&rsquo;s love, and according to Ephesians 2:8, salvation is by God&rsquo;s grace. But in Romans 1:16 and 17 Paul does not say that salvation is out of the love of God or by the grace of God but says that it comes by the righteousness of God. We have been saved by God&rsquo;s love and grace, but we have been saved especially by God&rsquo;s righteousness. God&rsquo;s love and grace may change in relation to us, but it is impossible for God&rsquo;s righteousness to change. Because Christ has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law, has died for our sins, and has been resurrected for our justification (Rom. 4:25), God is bound by His righteousness to save us. God cannot change His mind concerning this, for He is bound by His righteousness. Therefore, for our salvation we stand on God&rsquo;s righteousness. With the righteousness of God we, the believers in Christ, have been justified through our believing into Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">d. Believing On, Taking the Ground<br />
and the Stand On, the Lord Jesus to Be Saved</h2>
<p>To believe is to believe on, to take the ground and stand on, the Lord Jesus to be saved. Acts 16:31 says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved.&rdquo; This indicates that we believe not only into Christ but also on Christ. This is to take the ground and the standing on the person of Christ and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the belief, the faith, of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We believe on Christ as the ground and standing so that we may be saved.</p>
<p>Mark 16:16 says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.&rdquo; This verse does not say &ldquo;who does not believe and is not baptized.&rdquo; This indicates that condemnation is related to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing is sufficient for one to receive salvation from condemnation. To believe is to receive the Lord Jesus not only for forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43) but also for regeneration (1 Pet. 1:21, 23) that we may become the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30) in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>Romans 1:16 tells us that the gospel is &ldquo;the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes.&rdquo; In the book of Romans salvation includes not only salvation from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from hell; it also includes salvation from naturalness, self-likeness, individualism, and divisiveness. This salvation saves us to the uttermost, enabling us to be sanctified, conformed, glorified, transformed, built up with the others as the one Body, and not divisive in the church life. For all who believe, the gospel is the power of God unto such a full, complete, and ultimate salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. Through the Hearing of the Word</h2>
<p>Our believing in Christ is through the hearing of the word, which is &ldquo;the word of the truth of the gospel&rdquo; (Col. 1:5). The truth of the gospel is the reality, the real facts, of the gospel. In Romans 10:14 Paul asks, &ldquo;How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?&rdquo; Believing in Christ requires the hearing of Him, and hearing of Him requires the preaching of the gospel. Acts 4:4a says, &ldquo;Many of those who heard the word believed.&rdquo; This word is &ldquo;the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation&rdquo; (Eph. 1:13). Through hearing the word of the gospel we believed in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">f. Believing in the Gospel</h2>
<p>In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel!&rdquo; To repent is mainly in the mind; to believe is mainly in the heart (Rom. 10:9). To believe in something is to believe into the thing which we believe. It is also to receive the things which we believe into us. To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in Jesus Christ (Acts 16:31), and to believe in Him is to believe into Him (John 3:15-16) and receive Him into us (John 1:12), so that we may be organically united with Him. Such a faith in Christ (Gal. 3:22) is given to us by God (Eph. 2:8) through our hearing the word of the truth of the gospel (Rom. 10:17; Eph. 1:13). This faith brings us into all the blessings of the gospel (Gal. 3:14). Hence, this faith is precious to us (2 Pet. 1:1). Such precious faith requires repentance to precede it.</p>
<p>In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus preached that we should believe specifically in the gospel. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God (v. 1), the gospel of God, and the gospel of the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ, the Son of God with all the processes through which He has passed, including incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and all the redemptive work He accomplished, is the contents of the gospel (Rom. 1:1-4; Luke 2:10-11; 1 Cor. 15:1-4; 2 Tim. 2:8). Hence, the gospel is of Him. The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God (Eph. 1:8-9; Acts 2:23; Rom. 1:2; 2 Cor. 5:21; Acts 3:15), and it is the power of God unto salvation to all believers (Rom. 1:16), that they may be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:19) and regenerated by Him (1 Pet. 1:3) to be His children (John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16) and enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance (Eph. 1:14). Hence, it is the gospel of God. It brings the believers into the realm of the divine ruling that they may participate in the blessings of the divine life in the divine kingdom (1 Thes. 2:12). Hence, it is also the gospel of the kingdom of God. Therefore, the full contents of the gospel are the same as that of the New Testament with all its bequests. When we believe in this gospel, we inherit the Triune God with His redemption, His salvation, and His life with its riches for our eternal portion.</p>
<h2 class="head3">g. Believing That Jesus Is the Christ,<br />
the Son of God to Have Life in His Name</h2>
<p>John 20:31 says, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; is the title of the Lord Jesus according to His office, His mission. This title denotes His work to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. &ldquo;The Son of God&rdquo; is the Lord&rsquo;s title according to His person. His person is a matter of God&rsquo;s life, and His mission is a matter of God&rsquo;s work. He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God. He works for God by the life of God so that by believing in Him we may have the life of God to become children of God.</p>
<p>Because Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, we need to believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God. We must believe that He is the One who is the divine Person coming to carry out God&rsquo;s commission for His eternal purpose. By believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, we have life in His name.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we covered several aspects of believing. We have seen that, as believers, we have received Him who is the Word, the very God, and the true light, believing into His name; that we have believed into the Son of God and the Son of Man to have an organic union with Him; that we have believed into Christ Jesus to be justified with the righteousness of God; that we have believed on the Lord Jesus to be saved; that our believing in Christ is through the hearing of the Word; and that we have believed in the gospel. In this message we shall cover more aspects of our believing. After we consider these matters, we should have an accurate and thorough description of our believing in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">h. With the Heart Believing,<br />
That God Has Raised the Lord Jesus<br />
from among the Dead, unto Righteousness</h2>
<p>With the heart we believe that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead (Rom. 10:9), and with the heart we believe &ldquo;unto righteousness&rdquo; (v. 10). In many instances the Greek word translated &ldquo;unto&rdquo; means &ldquo;resulting in.&rdquo; The result of believing with the heart is righteousness. With the heart we believe the fact that God has raised Christ from among the dead, and this kind of believing results in righteousness. This means that through believing with our heart that God has raised Christ from among the dead we are justified. If we want to be justified, that is, to have the righteousness of God, we must believe with our heart that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head3">i. With the Mouth Confessing the Lord Jesus<br />
and Calling Upon His Name unto Salvation</h2>
<p>Our believing is not only with the heart but also with the mouth confessing the Lord Jesus and calling upon His name unto salvation. Romans 10:9 and 10 say, &ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation.&rdquo; Just as believing with the heart results in righteousness, so confessing with the mouth results in salvation. Inwardly with the heart we believe that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead, and outwardly with the mouth we confess the Lord Jesus and call upon His name unto salvation (Rom. 10:12-13). Being justified is before God; it is something inward, something in our heart. To be saved is before men and requires that outwardly we confess the Lord Jesus and call on His name.</p>
<p>Romans 10:9 and 10 reveal clearly that believing is an activity with two aspects, an inward aspect and an outward aspect. The inward aspect is to believe in our heart the fact that Jesus Christ was raised up from among the dead by God. The outward aspect is to confess audibly and openly the Lord Jesus, calling upon His name. This confessing and calling results in salvation before men, for others can see that we have been saved.</p>
<p>Romans 10:12 and 13 say, &ldquo;There is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; Calling on the Lord is different from merely praying to Him. The Greek word for call means to invoke a person, to call a person by name. Although it is possible to pray to the Lord silently, calling on the Lord requires that we call out to Him or address Him audibly. In order to be saved we need to call upon the name of the Lord. However, calling upon His name is not only for salvation; it is also the way in which we receive the riches of Christ. The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him. When we call upon Him, we participate in and enjoy His riches. We have a mouth to call on Him that we may be filled with Him, and we have a heart to believe in Him and to retain Him.</p><h2 class="head3">j. Such Believing Is the Faith<br />
Given by God as a Gift</h2>
<p>Our believing is a gift given to us by God. This means that faith is something initiated by God, formed by Him, and given to us by Him. Therefore, it is of God that we could believe through hearing the word of the gospel.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:8 says, &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.&rdquo; Faith is the substantiating of invisible things. It is by faith that we substantiate all the things Christ has accomplished for us. Through such a substantiating ability, we have been saved by grace. The free action of God&rsquo;s grace saved us through our substantiating faith.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:8 indicates that faith is not of our works, nor of our endeavor or strife; rather, faith is God&rsquo;s gift, that no one should boast (v. 9). Faith is not of ourselves. Although we believe, the faith with which we believe does not originate with us. In ourselves, we do not have any faith. However, at the time we repented and made confession to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, the believing ability was put into us. Before we were saved, we were utterly unable to believe. But on the day we were saved faith was imparted to us, and we believed. Although we have never seen the Lord Jesus, we cannot help believing in Him. This faith is not of ourselves but is part of the grace transmitted into us.</p>
<p>Faith is actually an aspect of Christ. This is the reason the New Testament speaks of the faith of Christ (Rom. 3:22). In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; Faith is Christ Himself. The faith which is given to us is the faith common to all believers (Titus 1:4). Faith is given, faith is received, and faith is common. When we put all these facts together, we see that this faith is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Our faith in Christ comes not out of us but out of Him. We have faith in Christ because He is absolutely believable. When we appreciate Christ, faith is imparted to us. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that faith is Christ. This is like saying that holiness, love, righteousness, patience, and endurance are Christ.</p>
<p>Because the unique faith is Christ Himself, we who believe in Him have a common faith. You do not have one kind of faith and I, another kind. When Christ came to you, you believed; and when He came to me, I believed. Whenever Christ comes to a person, that person believes in Him. This is a further indication that faith comes not out of us but out of Christ. Because faith is a gift of God and is not of our works, none of us has the right to boast. On the contrary, we all should humbly thank the Lord and praise Him that we have received Him as our faith.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Through the Divine Revelation<br />
of the Word of the Truth in the New Testament, Conveying as Its Contents the All-inclusive Christ<br />
in His All-inclusive Person<br />
and His All-inclusive Work as Scenery to Our View</h2>
<p>The faith which is the gift of God is through the divine revelation of the word of the truth in the New Testament economy, conveying as its contents the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and His all-inclusive work as &ldquo;scenery&rdquo; to our view. God forms the gift of faith and gives it to us through the divine revelation of the word of truth in the New Testament. The whole Bible reveals Christ. Especially the book of Revelation, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the whole Bible, is &ldquo;the revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Rev. 1:1). Through the preaching of the gospel, the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and work was presented as scenery to our view. When we heard the gospel, we heard the speaking of the word of the truth of the New Testament. As this speaking was taking place, a revelation came to us conveying the all-inclusive Christ as the scenery for us to view. We may say that we were a camera, that our spirit was the film, and that the divine revelation as the scenery was the object to be photographed.</p><h2 class="head4">(2) Through the Hearing<br />
of the Word of the Divine Revelation,<br />
the Seeing of the Divine Scenery<br />
Being Generated by the Spirit within the Hearers</h2>
<p>Through the hearing of the word of the divine revelation (Eph. 1:13), the seeing of the divine scenery is generated by the Spirit within the believers. First the scenery of the all-inclusive Christ is revealed in the word of the gospel. Then the seeing of this divine scenery is generated within the believers by the Spirit.</p>
<p>Faith implies all the items in the scenery of the New Testament. In the New Testament there is a complete picture of this scenery. But how can this scenery get into us? It comes through the seeing generated by the Spirit&rsquo;s work. This was our experience when we were saved and regenerated. We heard the preaching of the gospel, there was a &ldquo;click&rdquo; of the &ldquo;shutter&rdquo; of the &ldquo;camera,&rdquo; and the light came into us. As a result there was a seeing of the divine scenery.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) This Seeing of the Divine Scenery<br />
Bringing the Pneumatic Christ into the Hearers<br />
to Become the Believing Element and Ability<br />
within Them so That They Believe in Him Spontaneously</h2>
<p>The seeing of the divine scenery brings the pneumatic Christ into the believers, and He becomes the believing element and ability within them, so that they believe in Him spontaneously. In this way He becomes their faith in Him and thus the Author of their faith (Heb. 12:2), a faith that is called the faith of Christ (Gal. 2:16, 20; Phil. 3:9). First the divine revelation as the scenery is presented to our view. Second the seeing of this scenery is generated in us by the Spirit. Then the seeing of the divine scenery brings the pneumatic Christ into us to become our faith. This is the faith with which we believe. This is our believing.</p>
<p>One day, we, typical sinners in Adam, heard the preaching of the word according to the New Testament, a word telling us about Christ, His death, and His resurrection. Spontaneously, the divine revelation as the scenery was presented to our view. Without our being conscious of it, the &ldquo;cover&rdquo; of the &ldquo;lens&rdquo; of the &ldquo;camera&rdquo; was removed. This means that our mind was opened to the scenery of the divine revelation. Then at a certain point there was a &ldquo;click,&rdquo; and the Spirit, the heavenly light, generated a seeing of the scenery within us. The scenery was impressed on the &ldquo;film&rdquo; of our spirit, and we believed in the Lord Jesus. This believing was produced by the pneumatic Christ, who is the enlightening Spirit, revealed through the preaching of the word of the divine revelation. Once this pneumatic Christ came into our being, He became our believing element and believing ability. This is the faith formed by God and given to us by God as a gift. This gift is actually Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The faith with which we believe is not ours but God&rsquo;s. This faith is formed by God and given to us by Him. When the pneumatic Christ was revealed in us through the preaching of the gospel, He became the believing element and ability within us. In this way we believed in Him, having received the gift of faith through the hearing of the word and the seeing of the divine scenery.</p>
<p>Because Christ is the believing element and ability within us, He is the Author of our faith. Hebrews 12:2 says, &ldquo;Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith.&rdquo; As the Author of our faith, Christ is the Originator, Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith. According to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability. However, we obtain faith by God&rsquo;s gift. When we look unto Jesus, He, as the life-giving Spirit, transfuses us with Himself as the believing element. Then spontaneously a kind of believing arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. This is not of ourselves but of Him who imparts Himself as the believing element and ability into us to believe for us. Hence, it is Christ Himself as our faith.</p>
<p>This faith is called the faith of Christ. Galatians 2:16 speaks of the faith of Christ, and verse 20, of the faith of the Son of God. In Philippians 3:9 Paul again mentions the faith of Christ. This faith denotes our believing in Christ. Such faith issues from our knowing and appreciating Christ. It is Christ Himself, infused into us through our appreciation of Him, who becomes our faith in Him and brings us into an organic union with Him.</p>
<p>Genuine believing is to believe in the Lord Jesus by His faith. We believe in Jesus Christ by His faith, for we have no faith of our own, and He is the Author of our faith. Therefore, faith is not our invention; it cannot be initiated by us. It is impossible for us to generate faith. Faith is an aspect of Christ Himself. We do not live by our own faith&mdash; we have no faith of our own&mdash;but by the faith of the Son of the living God who has faith and who Himself is faith to us. If we look at ourselves, we shall never find faith. But if we forget ourselves, turn to the Lord Jesus, and call on Him, faith will immediately rise up within us. This faith is the faith of Christ, or we may say that it is Christ believing within us. Thus, the phrase &ldquo;through faith of Christ Jesus&rdquo; in Galatians 2:16 means believing in Christ through His faith.</p><h2 class="head3">k. This God-given Faith Being Allotted<br />
to All the Believers as a Common Precious Portion</h2>
<p>The God-given faith is allotted to all believers as a common precious portion (2 Pet. 1:1). The faith given to us by God is the portion of our inheritance allotted to us by God. As long as we have this gift, we have the lot of God&rsquo;s inheritance, for living faith equals the lot of God&rsquo;s inheritance. This is a common portion to all believers.</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:1 speaks of &ldquo;those who have been allotted like precious faith.&rdquo; As the children of Israel were allotted a piece of the good land (Josh. 14:1-5), we have been allotted like precious faith. This implies that all the things which relate to life and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3), including the divine nature (v. 4) partaken of by the believers through the like precious faith according to the precious and exceedingly great promises, are the real inheritance given to the believers by God in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The good land, the portion of the children of Israel in Old Testament times, typifies the all-inclusive Christ. According to Colossians 1:12, Christ is our portion. As the good land was the portion of the Old Testament saints, so Christ is the portion of the New Testament believers. Furthermore, in the Old Testament the good land was allotted to the twelve tribes, and in the New Testament precious faith is allotted to us. But how can faith be our allotted portion? According to the Bible, Christ is our portion. This means that it is Christ who has been allotted to us. But 2 Peter 1:1 says that we have been allotted like precious faith. To speak of Christ being our portion may be somewhat doctrinal. It is more experiential to say that faith is our portion. If Christ were merely Christ to us and not also faith, we would not be able to participate in Him or share in Him. In order for us to partake of Christ, He must become our faith. Such a faith has been allotted by God to all believers in Christ as their portion.</p>
<p>Faith is not merely a means; it is also a portion. A means is an instrument through which we obtain something, but the portion is the very thing we obtain. In 2 Peter 1:1 faith is not a means; rather, it is the very thing, the object, we receive. Therefore, in this verse faith equals the inheritance. Faith is an allotted portion of the New Testament inheritance. Yes, according to the New Testament, faith in a certain sense is a means. In particular, faith is the means by which we receive salvation and eternal life. But in 1:1 Peter considers faith not a means but an allotment, a portion of the New Testament inheritance allotted to us by God.</p>
<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that faith in 2 Peter 1:1 is equal to the New Testament inheritance. Our portion is Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. This Christ is revealed in the New Testament and conveyed to us through the New Testament. The New Testament is a container of the Christ who embodies the Triune God. This container conveys Christ to us mainly by the way of the preaching and teaching of the Word. Faith, then, comes from hearing, and hearing comes from the Word.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive Christ is not only the Word but also the life-giving Spirit. While Christ is preached to us through the Word and conveyed by the Word, He simultaneously works within us as the Spirit to produce faith in us. The issue of the faith produced within us is that whatever Christ is according to the word of the New Testament is imparted to us. As a result, we have the reality of Christ.</p>
<p>Faith and Christ are one. The faith which is the response to the content of the Word is actually Christ. This means that the response is one with that to which it is responding. In other words, faith (our response) and Christ are one. When in our experience our response and the Christ conveyed to us through the preaching of the Word become one, faith is produced within us. Therefore, our faith and Christ who is the object of our faith are actually one. This is the portion of the New Testament inheritance God has allotted to us.</p>
<p>Faith is not initiated by us, and it is not something that is out of us. On the contrary, faith is out of God, it is initiated by God, and it is allotted to us by God. In what way is faith allotted to us? Faith comes to us by the word in God&rsquo;s revelation. When this word is preached to us, it conveys the reality of the New Testament inheritance. Furthermore, as this word is preached to us, simultaneously the Spirit works with it. Actually, according to the Bible, the word and the Spirit are one. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word (Eph. 6:17). Therefore, through the spoken word and by the working, the inspiring, of the Spirit, faith is produced within us. This is the way God allots to us the like precious faith. Through the spoken word and by the inspiring Spirit, God infuses faith into our being. Once this faith has been imparted into us, we have our portion of the New Testament inheritance.</p>
<p>In 1:1 Peter speaks of the allotment of &ldquo;like&rdquo; precious faith. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;like&rdquo; literally means of equal value or honor; hence, equally precious. It does not mean equal in measure but equal in value and honor to all the receivers. All the portions of the precious faith are equal not in measure, quantity, but in quality. For example, the portion of the good land allotted to each of the twelve tribes differed in size, but although the allotments were different in size, they were equal in quality. For this reason, each allotment was equally precious. The principle is the same with the like precious faith.</p>
<p>Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth (Heb. 11:1), which is the reality of the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are composed of all the things which relate to life and godliness, that is, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as life within and godliness without. The like precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of His New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the very element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth. But it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all with itself (faith) subjective to us in our experience. It can be compared to the scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) that are objective to the camera (us). But when the light (the Spirit) brings the scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and scenery become subjective to it.</p><h2 class="head3">l. This Precious Faith Given by God<br />
within Us through the Spirit as the Power<br />
and Christ as the Element Being<br />
the Key to Receive God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy, as the Law Given by God<br />
outside of Israel through the Angels and Moses Was the Key to God&rsquo;s Old Testament Dispensation</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The precious faith given by God within us through the Spirit as the power and Christ as the element is the key to receive God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, as the law given by God outside of Israel through the angels and Moses (Gal. 3:19) was the key to God&rsquo;s Old Testament dispensation (Gal. 3:23, 26). Two important words in Galatians 3 are law and faith. Before faith came there was the law, which was the key to God&rsquo;s Old Testament dispensation. Now in the New Testament the key is no longer the law but faith. Faith is the key for us to receive God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Faith has come to replace the law. This is the faith that is produced, formed, and given to us by God. Now this living faith is the key for us to receive all the blessings, even all the bequests, of the New Testament economy of God.</h2>
<p>The law was the principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament economy. &ldquo;Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed&rdquo; (Gal. 3:23). To be guarded is to be kept in custody, to be kept in ward. To be guarded under law can be compared to sheep being enclosed in a fold (John 10:1, 16). The law was used as a fold to keep God&rsquo;s chosen people until Christ came. Because Christ has come, God&rsquo;s people should no longer be kept under the law.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;unto&rdquo; in 3:23 can also be translated &ldquo;with a view to.&rdquo; This indicates that the shutting up has an objective or goal in view. It should result in bringing the guarded people to the faith.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:24 says, &ldquo;So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;child-conductor&rdquo; can also be rendered escort, guardian, or custodian. It denotes one who cares for a child who is under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster. The law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came and to escort and conduct them to Christ at the proper time.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:25 goes on to say, &ldquo;But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&rdquo; Since faith in Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding law any longer.</p>
<p>Just as the law was the basic principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, faith is the basic principle according to which He deals with people in the New Testament. All those who refuse to believe in Christ will perish, whereas those who believe in Him will be forgiven of their sins and receive eternal life. In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God. This indicates that the unique sin which causes people to perish is unbelief. God&rsquo;s commandment to sinners is to believe in the Son of God.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:23 and 25 speak of the coming of faith. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.&rdquo; This verse indicates clearly that there was a time when faith came and was revealed. Faith was not to be found in the Old Testament; it came with Jesus Christ. When Christ came, grace came, and faith came also. Faith has come to replace law. Thus, Galatians 3:25 says, &ldquo;Faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&rdquo; According to this verse, now that faith has come we are no longer under the law as our child-conductor. Faith and law cannot co-exist. Before faith came, we were under law. But now that faith has come and has been revealed, this faith replaces law. The law kept us and brought us to Christ, but now in our experience it should be replaced by faith. Faith characterizes those who believe in Christ and distinguishes them from those who keep the law (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 3:9). We are not keepers of law&mdash;we are believers in Christ. We are the people of faith.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:7 and 9 speak of those &ldquo;who are of faith.&rdquo; According to Darby&rsquo;s <em>New Translation</em>, this expression denotes the principle of faith. In his version he adopts the rendering &ldquo;on the principle of faith.&rdquo; To be of faith means to be on the principle of faith. We are those who take faith as our principle. Everything we do should be in keeping with this principle. By this principle we come to Christ, receive Him, and become one with Him in the organic union.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<p>According to the New Testament, the believers have not only believed in Christ but have also been baptized. Baptism is even more difficult to define than faith is. Whereas faith is somewhat mysterious, it is nonetheless a direct fact. Baptism, however, is not only a fact but also a symbol, and because it is a symbol it is not easily explained. In this message and in the message following, we shall seek to define baptism according to the holy Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. Baptized</h2>
<p>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the necessity and importance of baptism. In Mark 16:16 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.&rdquo; To believe is to receive Christ not only for forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43) but also for regeneration (1 Pet. 1:21, 23), so that those who believe may become the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30) in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of Christ and by being raised to be the new creation of God through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance preached by John (Mark 1:4; Acts 19:3-5).</p>
<p>To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. Moreover, water baptism should be accompanied by the Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea (water) and in the cloud (Spirit)&mdash;1 Corinthians 10:2 and 12:13.</p>
<p>Mark 16:16 does not say &ldquo;who does not believe and is not baptized shall be condemned.&rdquo; This indicates that condemnation is related only to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing itself is sufficient for one to receive salvation from condemnation; yet believing needs baptism as an outward affirmation for the completion of one&rsquo;s inward salvation.</p>
<p>In the case of Philip preaching the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-39), we have the case of a genuine Gentile believing in the Lord. From Isaiah 53 Philip &ldquo;brought the good news of Jesus to him&rdquo; (v. 35). Then &ldquo;as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch says, Look, water! What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo; (v. 36). The fact that the Ethiopian eunuch had such a reaction when seeing water indicates that Philip in his gospel preaching should have spoken to him about water baptism. If Philip had not said anything about baptism, it is unlikely that the Ethiopian would have reacted in this way. Philip may still have been talking about water baptism when they came to the water in which the eunuch was baptized.</p>
<p>In this gospel case water baptism is particularly emphasized, but no mention is made of Spirit baptism. This should give us strong instruction that we must pay attention to water baptism, which signifies the believers&rsquo; identification with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection (Rom. 6:5; Col. 2:12), as well as to Spirit baptism. Spirit baptism signifies the reality of the believers&rsquo; union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically, whereas water baptism is the believers&rsquo; affirmation of the Spirit&rsquo;s reality. Both are needed (Acts 10:47), and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both.</p>
<p>Concerning baptism, water signifies death and burial for the termination of repentant people, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated ones. The death-water, pointing to and signifying the all-inclusive death of Christ into which His believers are baptized, buries not only the baptized ones themselves but also their sins, the world, and their past. It also separates them from the God-forsaking world and its corruption. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13), which is joined to Christ in the one Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule (John 3:3, 5), so that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom.</p>
<p>In chapter eight of Acts the eunuch received water baptism and Spirit baptism at the same time. There are not two baptisms, a water baptism and a Spirit baptism. Water baptism and Spirit baptism are one. In God&rsquo;s economy there is only one baptism. It would be wrong to ask whether this one baptism is water baptism or Spirit baptism. In the sight of God there is only one baptism with two aspects&mdash;the aspect of water and the aspect of Spirit. For God there is not the need of water, only of Spirit. However, as human beings, who are physical, we have the need for a material confirmation of spiritual things. Water baptism, therefore, is the outward affirmation of inward Spirit baptism. Whenever we baptize someone in water, we need to have the faith that we are baptizing that person not only into the water but also into the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Acts 16 we have two more cases of the baptism of believers. Speaking of Lydia, &ldquo;whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things spoken by Paul&rdquo; (v. 14), we are told that &ldquo;she was baptized and her household&rdquo; (v. 15). Here we see that baptism immediately followed believing, as the Lord commanded in Mark 16:16. The same thing happened with the Philippian jailer. Paul and Silas &ldquo;spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house. And taking them with him in that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and he was baptized immediately, he and all his household&rdquo; (Acts 16:32-33). Once again baptism was practiced immediately after someone believed.</p><h2 class="head3">a. Into the Name (Denoting the Person)<br />
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,<br />
into an Organic Union<br />
with the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>To be baptized is to be baptized into the name (denoting the person) of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into an organic union with the processed Triune God. This is revealed by the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 28:19: &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Baptism is to bring repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ so that they may become kingdom people. John the Baptist&rsquo;s recommending ministry began with the preliminary baptism by water only. Now, after the Lord Jesus accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect; whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13) on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:5; 2:4) and in the house of Cornelius (Acts 11:15-17). Then, based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts (Acts 2:38), not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4), into Christ Himself (Gal. 3:27), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the history of the baptized ones. Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, since Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and since the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 28:19 is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;into&rdquo; in 28:19 indicates union, as in Romans 6:3, Galatians 3:27, and 1 Corinthians 12:13. The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:3, 5; and 1 Corinthians 1:13, 15. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to baptize them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:19 there is one name for the Trinity. The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize believers into the name of the Trinity is to immerse them into all the Triune God is.</p>
<p>By the time the Lord Jesus gave the charge to His disciples recorded in 28:19, He had already died an all-inclusive death on the cross, had been buried, had entered into Hades to overcome the power of death and everything related to it, and had come out of death and had entered into resurrection. Furthermore, He, the pneumatic Christ, had already breathed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into the disciples (John 20:22). Having done all this, He charged them to disciple the nations and to bring them into the Triune God so that they may have an organic union with Him. However, the Lord Jesus did not tell the disciples to baptize the discipled nations into the Triune God but to baptize them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. To baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is in fact to baptize them into the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Unless baptism in the Holy Spirit is specifically designated, the word &ldquo;baptism&rdquo; in the New Testament indicates baptism through water implying the significance of the baptism in the Spirit. Even the water baptism of John the Baptist pointed to Spirit baptism. Although John&rsquo;s baptism did not imply the Spirit, it nevertheless pointed to the Spirit. With the Lord Jesus and the apostles baptism implies both the water and the Spirit. This principle applies to the baptism mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 28:19. Therefore, to baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is to baptize them both in the water and in the Spirit. Physically, we baptize believers in water, yet the water symbolizes the divine name, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This means that when we put people into the water of baptism, we put them into the person of the Triune God so that they may have an organic union with Him.</p><h2 class="head3">b. Into the Name of the Lord Jesus,<br />
Who Is the All-inclusive Embodiment<br />
of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>According to the book of Acts, the believers are baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, who is the all-inclusive embodiment of the processed Triune God. Acts 8:16 speaks of those who were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. The name denotes the person. To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is to be baptized into the person of the Lord, to be identified with the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, to be put into an organic union with the living Lord.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. But later, in practice, the believers were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. This indicates that to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit because the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9).</p>
<p>Acts 19:5 tells us of certain believers at Ephesus who &ldquo;were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This is to be baptized into a spiritual union with the all-inclusive Christ. Apparently, these believers were not baptized into the name of the Triune God but into the name of the Lord Jesus. Actually, by being baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus they were baptized into the name of the Triune God, for the Lord Jesus is the all-inclusive embodiment of the processed Triune God. Today, when we baptize believers into the name of the Lord Jesus we are actually baptizing them into the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. In the Name of Jesus Christ,<br />
in the Sphere of the Name of Jesus Christ,<br />
within Which Is the Reality of the Baptism</h2>
<p>In the book of Acts we see that the believers are baptized not only into the name of the Lord Jesus but also in the name of Jesus Christ. Acts 10:48 says, &ldquo;He charged them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; To be baptized into the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized into the sphere of the name of Jesus Christ, within which is the reality of baptism.</p>
<p>Some readers of the New Testament may think that there is no difference between being baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus and in the name of Jesus Christ. However, there is an important difference. To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is to be baptized into the Triune God to have an organic union with Him. But to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized in Christ as a sphere, the sphere of the name of Jesus Christ. It is also to be baptized into Jesus Christ as an element. Within Christ as the sphere and element is the reality of baptism. Apparently, water is the sphere and element in which the believers are baptized. But the water signifies a person, the all-inclusive Christ. This person, signified by His name, is the sphere and element in which we baptize the believers.</p>
<p>The divine and spiritual reality of baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ. Baptism, therefore, should not be a ritual through which people become members of a religion. We need to touch the reality of baptism. The water symbolizes the spiritual and divine reality which is the Triune God embodied in the all-inclusive Christ. When we baptize others, we need to pray for the divine reality of baptism.</p>
<p>Although our concern is with the spiritual reality of baptism, we still need water as a symbol. If we simply say to others that we are baptizing them in the name of Jesus Christ without putting them into water, there would be nothing to symbolize the reality of baptism. We need to put the believers into water. Nevertheless, actually we are not baptizing them in water, for the water is a symbol of the reality in the name, the person, of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Concerning baptism, water has four characteristics. First, water is enterable. Second, people can be buried in water. Third, water is used for washing. Fourth, according to the Bible, water is used for separation. For example, the deluge separated Noah and his family from the perverted, corrupted age. Also, the water of the Red Sea separated the children of Israel from the Egyptians. All these four characteristics are included in the matter of baptism. The water indicates that our God is enterable. Thus, when we baptize the believers, we put them into the enterable God. Furthermore, when believers are baptized, they are buried in God. In a very real sense, God is the tomb in which we are buried. To be buried in water is actually to be buried in God. The preaching of repentance by John the Baptist indicates this. All those who were willing to repent were buried by John the Baptist in water. The water in which they were buried points to the Holy Spirit. John the Baptist said that he baptized in water unto repentance, but that One&mdash;the Lord Jesus&mdash;was coming who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11; John 1:33). Elsewhere we have pointed out that the Holy Spirit is the germinating element. But unless we are buried the Spirit cannot germinate us. The point we are emphasizing here is that the water of baptism signifies that our God is enterable and that we, through baptism, are buried in Him.</p>
<p>When we baptize others, we need the deep realization that actually we are not putting them into water but are putting them into the enterable God. This is not the unprocessed God, the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, but the God who, embodied in Christ, has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This processed Triune God is the sphere and element into which the believers are baptized. This is what it means to baptize the believers in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. Upon or on the Name of Jesus Christ,<br />
upon the Ground of What the Name of Jesus Christ Stands for, That Is, for All That the Person<br />
of Jesus Christ Is and All That He Has Accomplished, Both of Which Constitute the Faith (the Contents)<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>In Acts 2:38 Peter says, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ....&rdquo; To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for. This name stands for all that the person of Jesus Christ is and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the faith, the contents, of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It is on this ground that the believers in Christ are baptized.</p>
<p>The New Testament uses three different prepositions to describe the relationship of baptism to the Lord Jesus. First, <em>eis</em>, into (Matt. 28:19; Acts 8:16; 19:5; Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27), signifies a spiritual union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. Second, <em>en</em>, in (Acts 10:48), signifies the sphere of the name of Jesus Christ. Third, <em>epi</em>, upon or on (Acts 2:38), indicates that we are baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for. This name stands for all that the Lord Jesus is and all that He has accomplished. Now we can understand why these three prepositions are used with respect to baptism in the New Testament. The person of Jesus Christ is not only the sphere in which we are baptized but also the ground, the standing, upon which we are baptized. This ground comprises Christ&rsquo;s person and work, and His person and work constitute the faith of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This means that we baptize the believers on the ground of the New Testament faith. Therefore, the believers are baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into the name of the Lord Jesus, in the name of Jesus Christ, and upon the name of Jesus Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">e. Into Christ to Put On Christ,<br />
to Enter into the Organic Union with Christ</h2>
<p>The believers have been baptized into Christ to put on Christ, to enter into the organic union with Christ. &ldquo;As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 3:27). To be baptized into Christ is the way to be in Christ. Based upon the fact that we have been baptized into Christ, we can say that we have put on Christ.</p>
<p>To believe is to believe into Christ (John 3:16), and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ. By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, having thus put on Christ and having become identified with Christ. Because we have been baptized into Christ, we now enjoy an organic union with Him.</p>
<p>In order to experience the organic union with Christ, we need to believe into Him and be baptized into Him. Believing and being baptized are two parts of one step. First we believe into Christ, then we are baptized into Him. By believing in Christ we believe into Christ. (The Greek preposition <em>eis</em>, used in John 3:16, 18, and 36, means into.) By believing in Christ we enter into Christ. In addition to believing into Christ, which is inward and subjective, we also need to be baptized into Him, an act that is outward and objective. We need both the inward action of believing and the outward action of being baptized. In this way we make one complete step to enter into Christ. The step which begins with believing into Christ is completed by being baptized into Christ. In this way there takes place in full an organic union between the believers and Christ.</p>
<p>We should never baptize believers in a ritualistic way, regarding baptism simply as an act of putting someone into water according to the Bible. Such a baptism is void of the reality of the organic union. As we baptize a believer, we should exercise our faith to realize that we are baptizing that one not only into the water but also into a spiritual reality. As we immerse him into the water, we immerse him into Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. When a person is baptized into Christ, he enters into an organic union, which is able to transform his whole being.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 speaks of baptizing the believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and Galatians 3:27 says that we have been baptized into Christ. The Christ in Galatians 3:27 is equal to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in Matthew 28:19. Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit. When we baptize believers into Christ, we baptize them into the Triune God.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27 tells us that as many as are baptized into Christ &ldquo;have put on Christ.&rdquo; To put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment. On the one hand, in baptism we are immersed into Christ; on the other hand, in baptism we put on Christ. Christ is the living Spirit. Hence, to be baptized into Christ is to be immersed into Him as the Spirit. When a believer is immersed into Christ, he automatically puts on Christ as his clothing. This means that the baptized one has become one with Christ, having been immersed into Him and having been clothed with Him.</p>
<p>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, there would be no way for us to be baptized into Christ. How could we be baptized into Christ if, according to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, He were only sitting in the heavens? For us to be baptized into Christ, Christ must be the <em>pneuma</em>, the air, the Spirit, all around us. If we regard Christ simply as One in the heavens far away, we can practice baptism as a ritual, and people can be baptized without any realization of the significance of baptism. However, we cannot be baptized into a Christ who is only in the heavens. But we can be baptized into Christ who is the <em>pneuma</em>, the Spirit. This is proved by 1 Corinthians 12:13, where we are told that in one Spirit we were baptized into one Body. The Spirit here is the all-inclusive, processed Triune God. In the Spirit, the processed Triune God, we have been baptized into one Body. Therefore, for us to be baptized into such a reality, Christ must be the life-giving Spirit. Whenever we baptize others, we should believe that the Triune God as the processed life-giving Spirit is all around them and that they are being immersed into this divine reality.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that to put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ. Whenever we clothe ourselves in a certain way, we indicate that we intend to live in that way. In like manner, to put on Christ means that we live by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ. In particular, it means that we live out Christ. Christ becomes the expression of our living. Immediately after we have been put into Christ and have entered into an organic union with Him, we need to live Christ. Day by day, we need to be clothed with Christ and express Him as we live in Him, by Him, and with Him.</p>
<p>In Romans 6:3 Paul again speaks of being baptized into Christ. Although we were born in one person, Adam, we have been baptized into another person, Christ. Whether we were good or bad, we were born in Adam. By being baptized into Christ we get into Christ and become a part of Him. The meaning of baptism is to put the believers into Christ. Baptism, therefore, is an extremely significant experience, for in it a spiritual transfer takes place. Baptism is an act in which we put the members of Adam into the death of Christ, thereby transferring them out of Adam and into Christ. Whenever we baptize others we need to have this realization.</p>
<p>We praise the Lord that we have been baptized into Christ. Although we were born in Adam, by baptism we have been identified with Christ in His death and resurrection. Through death and resurrection Christ was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Even Christ Himself needed death and resurrection to transform Him from the flesh to the Spirit. Likewise, through identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ. When we were baptized into Christ, we were transferred from being a part of Adam into being a part of Christ. Now we are no longer in Adam&mdash;we are absolutely in Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">f. Into the Death of Christ<br />
to Be Identified with His All-inclusive Death</h2>
<p>In Romans 6:3 Paul says, &ldquo;Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&rdquo; Here we see that when we were baptized into Christ Jesus, we were also baptized into the death of Christ. On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ&rsquo;s person; on the other hand, we have been baptized into Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>It is significant that in 6:3 Paul says that we have been baptized not into Christ&rsquo;s resurrection but into His death. The resurrected Christ still bears in Himself the effectiveness of His death. Otherwise we could not be baptized into His death by being baptized into Him. The fact that we are baptized into Christ and into His death indicates that Christ and His death are one. The resurrection of Christ carries the element of His effective death. Thus, when a believer is baptized into Christ, he is spontaneously baptized into the death of Christ. It is impossible to separate Christ&rsquo;s death from Christ Himself. The being of the resurrected Christ includes the element of His effective death. The effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death is one of the ingredients of His all-inclusive being. Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into His death.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous difference between death in Adam and the death of Christ. We loathe death in Adam, but we appreciate the sweetness of Christ&rsquo;s death. His death is dear and lovable, and we may abide restfully in it. How wonderful that a believer baptized into the all-inclusive Christ is also placed into the death of Christ! In the words of a hymn written by A. B. Simpson, &ldquo;Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ!&rdquo; Rest and victory are found in Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In Romans 6:4a Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death.&rdquo; Here Paul introduces the thought of burial; he says that with Christ we have been buried through baptism into death. Which comes first, death or burial? In the natural realm, a person dies first and then is buried. But Paul&rsquo;s word indicates that first we are buried and then enter into death. According to the New Testament, we, the believers, are buried into death. However, we are not buried into death directly; this takes place with Christ and through baptism.</p>
<p>Suppose a certain person repents and believes in the Lord Jesus. He should then be baptized into Christ. To baptize this new believer into Christ is to put him into the death of Christ. When he is baptized, he is actually buried. This burial results in death. This is what it means to be buried with Christ through baptism into death.</p>
<p>Every candidate for baptism is a person in the process of dying. Through baptism such a person is put to death. Having been identified with Christ and His death, he is immersed in water and is buried. Through baptism he enters into the actual experience of death with Christ.</p>
<p>The Christian life is a life of baptism. On the one hand, baptism has been accomplished; on the other hand, baptism continues until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. Hence, until this goal has been attained, we continue to live a life of baptism. This means that we are daily under the application of the death of Christ as we experience the effectiveness of His death, which is now one of the ingredients, the elements, in the all-inclusive Spirit. In our daily life we may experience the putting to death of the negative elements within us. This takes place not by doctrine or by a particular practice, but by the killing element in the death of Christ included in the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">g. Into the Body of Christ,<br />
into One Organic Entity with Christ<br />
as Its Life and Constituent, to Express Him</h2>
<p>The believers have also been baptized into the Body of Christ, into one organic entity with Christ as its life and constituent, to express Him. &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:13). As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our race, nationality, and social rank, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into this one living Body to express Christ.</p>
<p>The believers in Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ, the name of the Triune God, and the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-11), are for the profit, the building up, of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and be lost in Him. To drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever.</p>
<p>Today certain believers talk a great deal about the baptism in the Spirit but not nearly as much about being baptized into the Body. The baptism of the Spirit is not for individuals; it is for the Body, which is an organic entity. We know from Matthew 28:19 and Galatians 3:27 that we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ. The Triune God and Christ are organic and living. From Romans 6:3 we know that we have been baptized not only into Christ but also into His death. Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ. This negative aspect of baptism clears away such negative things as sin, the flesh, the self, and the old creation. The ultimate issue of baptism is that we are put into the Body. We praise the Lord that we have been baptized into the organic entity of the Body of Christ for His expression.</p><h2 class="head3">h. With (or in) Both Water and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the believers are baptized with (or in) both water and the Holy Spirit. In Acts 1:5 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo; In Acts 10:47 and 48 we have the water baptism of the house of Cornelius. Verse 47 says, &ldquo;Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit even as we?&rdquo; Furthermore, Acts 9:18 indicates that Saul of Tarsus was baptized with water. John 3:5 says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Water is the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation. Spirit is the concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. Whenever we baptize the believers, we baptize them both with the water and with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Water as the Symbol of the Baptism</h2>
<p>The water of baptism is a symbol and is rich in significance. First, the water signifies the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God. The water of baptism also signifies Christ. According to Matthew 28:19 and Galatians 3:27, when we baptize the believers into Christ we baptize them into the Triune God, for Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. Moreover, the water of baptism signifies the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4a). As we have seen, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into His death. Water is a symbol of baptism into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) The Holy Spirit as the Reality of the Baptism</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the reality of the baptism. The one baptism (Eph. 4:5) has the aspects of the Spirit and the water. The water, the outward affirmation, is a symbol, and the Spirit is the reality. For this reason, the believers are baptized both in water and in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) Typified by the Sea (Water)<br />
and the Cloud (the Spirit) of the Baptism<br />
in Which the Children of Israel Were Baptized</h2>
<p>Baptism in water and in the Holy Spirit is typified by the sea (water) and the cloud (the Spirit) of the baptism in which the children of Israel were baptized. &ldquo;All were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:2). In typology the children of Israel were baptized in the cloud and in the sea. They did not have two baptisms; they had one baptism with two elements&mdash;the cloud and the sea. The cloud signifies the Spirit from the heavens, and the sea signifies the water on earth. This type is a picture of our baptism today. The New Testament believers are baptized in the water and in the Spirit (Matt. 3:11; 1 Cor. 12:13). Whenever we baptize others, we baptize them in water and in the Spirit at the same time. This means that whenever we baptize believers in water, we simultaneously baptize them into the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">i. By Water</h2>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Signifying God&rsquo;s Judgment<br />
upon the God-rejecting World,<br />
Which Becomes the Separating Power<br />
to Save His Chosen People<br />
Out of the Corrupted Generation<br />
of the God-judged World</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:20-21a speaks of &ldquo;those once disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water: which figure also now saves you, baptism.&rdquo; The water here signifies God&rsquo;s judgment upon the God-rejecting world, which becomes the separating power to save His chosen people out of the corrupted generation of the God-judged world. Without judgment there cannot be separation. God&rsquo;s judgment signified by the water separates us. When we were baptized in water, we were judged by God, and that water separated us. This is fully portrayed in the type of Noah.</p><h2 class="head4">(2) Typified by the Water<br />
through Which Noah and His Family<br />
Were Delivered Out of the Old Generation<br />
of the Flood-judged World into a New Environment Produced by the Judgment of the Flood</h2>
<p>The water of baptism is typified by the water through which Noah and his family were delivered out of the old generation of the flood-judged world into a new environment produced by the judgment of the flood. In 1 Peter 3:20 the Greek words translated &ldquo;were brought safely through&rdquo; mean to &ldquo;arrive safe into a place of security through difficulty or danger&rdquo; as in Acts 27:44 (Darby). The Greek words rendered &ldquo;by water&rdquo; literally mean through water. Water was the medium through which the saving was accomplished. The ark saved Noah and his family from God&rsquo;s judgment, the destruction of the world by the flood. But the water saved them from the corrupted generation and separated them unto a new age, just as the water of the Red Sea did to the children of Israel (Exo. 14:22, 29; 1 Cor. 10:1-2) and the water of baptism to the New Testament believers.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:21 says, &ldquo;Which figure also now saves you, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse does not teach baptismal salvation, and we do not hold the belief that the waters of baptism put away the filth of the flesh. The words &ldquo;which figure&rdquo; refer to the water in the preceding verse, which is a figure of the water of baptism. This indicates that Noah and his family&rsquo;s being in the ark and passing through the flood was a type of our going through baptism. The water of the flood delivered them out of the old manner of life into a new environment. In like manner, the water of baptism delivers us out of the vain manner of life into a manner of life in resurrection.</p>
<p>Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh&mdash;the dirt of our fallen nature and defilement of fleshly lust. The erroneous teaching concerning baptismal salvation based upon this verse and Mark 16:16 and Acts 22:16 is corrected here. Baptism is only a figure. Its reality is Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, who applies to us all that Christ has passed through in His crucifixion and resurrection, making these things real in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">j. To Appeal to God</h2>
<h2 class="head4">(1) For a Good Conscience, Conscience<br />
with No More Offense,<br />
But Rather Full of Peace and Confidence<br />
That They Have Been Baptized into the Triune God<br />
and Organically United with Him</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:21 indicates that baptism is the appeal of a good conscience unto God. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; is <em>eperotema</em>, a question, an inquiry. Its meaning is very much disputed. The right meaning of the phrase seems to be, as Alford said, &ldquo;the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience,&rdquo; which governs the proper Christian life. This kind of question, asking for something, may be considered an appeal or demand. Peter&rsquo;s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God. Such a conscience has no more offense, but rather is full of peace and confidence that the baptized one has been baptized into the Triune God and organically united with Him.</p>
<p>When we are baptized, we, as baptized ones, appeal to God for a good and pure conscience. After we have been baptized and rise up out of the water, we have a conscience that is good and pure, a conscience without condemnation. All our sins, offenses, transgressions, and trespasses have been forgiven, and all the problems that estranged our life and our being have been buried in the water. This means that through baptism we have a clearance of our sinful past. Because of this clearance, we can have a good and pure conscience.</p>
<p>We would emphasize the fact that baptism itself does not put away the filth of the flesh. However, baptism does enable us to have the assurance to appeal to God for a good and pure conscience. Then, after we have been baptized, God answers us by indicating that we now have a conscience that is good and pure.</p><h2 class="head4">(2) Through the Resurrection of Christ,<br />
That Is, by Christ in Resurrection<br />
as the Spirit of Life, without Whom<br />
as the Reality Baptism by Water<br />
Is Only an Empty and Dead Ritual</h2>
<p>Verse 21 ends with the words &ldquo;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that baptism as an appeal to God for a good conscience is through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life, without whom as the reality baptism by water is only an empty and dead ritual. We appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrected Christ as the reality of baptism.</p>
<p>Apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we could not have resurrection life, and we could not have the life-giving Spirit within us. Through faith and baptism we have an organic union with the Triune God. It is through the resurrection of Christ that we are brought into the Triune God to have an organic union with Him. Now in the Triune God and with the Triune God we enjoy the divine life and the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, after we have been baptized, we have the divine life and the life-giving Spirit to make the figure of baptism real and living to us in our experience.</p>
<p>Verse 21 emphasizes baptism in relation to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The reality of baptism can be realized only by the divine life and the life-giving Spirit. Our basis for saying this is Peter&rsquo;s word &ldquo;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; It was in His resurrection that Christ released the divine life so that it could be imparted into our spirit. It was also in resurrection that Christ became the life-giving Spirit to come into our spirit, dwell in our spirit, and exercise all the riches of His divine life. It is through the resurrection of Christ that we genuinely and with assurance experience the reality of what is figured in baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) Such a Baptism with Water<br />
and with the Holy Spirit, as a Symbol,<br />
a Counterpart, of the Believers&rsquo; Belief<br />
in All the Accomplishments of Christ,<br />
Is Also a Testimony, Witnessing<br />
That between the Baptized and God<br />
There Is No More Problem</h2>
<p>Baptism with water and with the Holy Spirit, as a symbol, a counterpart, of the believers&rsquo; belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, is also a testimony, witnessing that between the baptized and God there is no more problem. Baptism with water and with the Holy Spirit is a symbol, and this symbol is a counterpart of our belief. We may say that our belief is the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; and that baptism is the &ldquo;wife&rdquo; to match the husband. As the counterpart of our belief in the accomplishments of Christ, baptism testifies that between us, the baptized ones, and God there are no problems.</p>
<p>A proper baptism will always bring the baptized one into a situation of appealing to God for a conscience that is good and pure. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus and were baptized, we were sinners. But when we were enlightened through the preaching of the gospel, we came to realize that we were very sinful. Both toward God and toward man we have had many transgressions, trespasses and offenses, and we had a great deal of guilt. Then we repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, received His forgiveness, and were saved. But our repentance and believing needed an outward expression. This expression is baptism. Therefore, baptism and our believing are two aspects of one thing. For this reason, the New Testament speaks of believing and being baptized (Mark 16:16). Believing and being baptized can be compared to using our two feet to take a single step. First we believe, and our believing can be compared to the half-step forward of one foot. Then we are baptized. Our baptism can be compared to the completion of the step with the other foot. Together, believing and baptism make one complete step. Therefore, baptism is the counterpart to our believing in Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(8)</h1>
<p>We have seen that, concerning their present, the believers have been called by God, they have been separated unto God by the Spirit, they have repented, they have believed, and they have been baptized. Now we need to see that the believers have been joined to the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Joined to the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>The believers have been joined to the processed Triune God through believing and through being baptized. We have believed into Christ (John 3:15-16), the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), and we have been baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27). Believing and being baptized are actually one complete step by which we enter into the Triune God. In this way we are joined to the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 indicates that the believers are baptized into the name, the person, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is to be baptized into the processed Triune God. To be baptized into the Triune God is to be brought into an organic union with Him. We sinners, after believing into the Lord Jesus, have been baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This produces an organic union between us and the Triune God. Now we, the baptized ones, are in this organic union. Having been baptized into the processed Triune God to be in the organic union with the Triune God, we have been joined to God the Father, to God the Son, and to God the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. To God the Father<br />
as the Source of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to God the Father as the source, the origin, of the divine Trinity. This is indicated by John 13:3 and 1 Corinthians 6:19b. John 13:3 says, &ldquo;Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.&rdquo; In John 8:42 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I came forth out of God and am come from Him,&rdquo; and in 16:28 He says, &ldquo;I came forth out of the Father.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus came from a wonderful source&mdash; the almighty, infinite God. The Lord&rsquo;s source was not Nazareth, Bethlehem, or even heaven. His source was the Father.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:19b speaks of &ldquo;the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God.&rdquo; First Corinthians 2:12 speaks of &ldquo;the Spirit which is from God,&rdquo; and John 15:26 reveals that the Spirit of reality proceeds from the Father. Hence, the Father is the source of the Spirit. As the source of the Lord Jesus and the Spirit, God the Father is thus the source of the divine Trinity, and we, as believers in Christ, have been joined to this source.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Having Turned to Him through Repentance</h2>
<p>The believers have been joined to God the Father by turning to Him through repentance. They have turned from the authority of Satan to God (Acts 26:18). To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. Through repentance we have turned to God from all things other than God. As believers who have been joined to the processed Triune God, we have had a full turn to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Baptized into Him</h2>
<p>According to Matthew 28:19b, the believers have been baptized into the name, the person, of the Father. They have been baptized into the riches of the Father, and, as indicated by the word &ldquo;into,&rdquo; they have been brought into a spiritual and mystical union with Him, that is, into an organic union with Him. Thus, they have been joined to God the Father by being baptized into Him.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) Born of Him as the Begetting Father</h2>
<p>In order for the believers to be joined to God the Father, it was necessary for them to be born of God as the begetting Father. John 1:13 speaks of the believers as those &ldquo;who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; This verse clearly tells us that we have been born of God. This birth took place when we believed in the Lord Jesus. When we were born of God to become His children, we were not born of our physical life, our fallen life, or our created life&mdash;we were born of God, the uncreated life.</p>
<p>James 1:18 also refers to God as the begetting Father: &ldquo;Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.&rdquo; God brought us forth, regenerated us, of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose, so that we might be the firstfruit of His creatures. To be the firstfruit of God&rsquo;s creatures is to be the vigorous life that matures first. This is by the divine birth, our regeneration (John 3:5-6), which is carried out according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>God brought us forth, regenerated us, by the word of truth. The word of truth is the word of the divine reality, the word of what the Triune God is (John 1:14, 17). This word is the seed of life by which we have been regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23).</p>
<p>God the Father brought us forth, regenerated us, by the word of truth, by the word of divine reality. When we heard the gospel, we heard the word of God&rsquo;s reality. We received this word and were reborn. Through the divine birth the divine life was imparted into our being. Now we not only possess the divine life, but we also are enjoying this life with its divine nature.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; being joined to God the Father involves three matters: repentance, baptism, and regeneration. We have turned to God through repentance, we have been baptized into Him, and we have been born of Him. In this way we have been joined to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. To God the Son, Christ,<br />
as the Embodiment of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>As those who are joined to the processed Triune God, we are joined to God the Son, Christ, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God (Col. 2:9; Matt. 28:19b). God the Father is the source, the origin, of the Trinity, and God the Son is the embodiment of the processed Trinity. All that the divine Trinity is, has, and does has been embodied in one all-inclusive person&mdash;Christ. Christ, therefore, is the embodiment of the processed divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) God Having Shined Him into Their Hearts</h2>
<p>Now we need to see in what way we are joined to God the Son as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. First, we are joined to Christ by God&rsquo;s having shined Him into our hearts. He has &ldquo;shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:6b). When we heard the preaching of the gospel, there was the shining of Christ into our hearts. God&rsquo;s shining Christ into our hearts results in the illumination of knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ, that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ. The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ&rsquo;s gospel known to us issues from God&rsquo;s shining Christ into our hearts. The proper preaching of the gospel is not only a matter of speaking but of God&rsquo;s shining. When we preach the gospel to others, we need to exercise our spirit by faith to speak in a shining way. Then through our speaking God will shine the living Christ into others.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Having Received Him</h2>
<p>When God shined Christ into our hearts, we received Him. The living Christ has been shined into us, and we have received Him into the depths of our being. John 1:12 speaks of receiving Christ: &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name.&rdquo; This indicates that to believe is to receive. We have received Christ by believing in Him.</p>
<p>In Colossians 2:6 Paul tells us that we &ldquo;have received Christ Jesus the Lord.&rdquo; Christ is the portion of the saints (Col. 1:12) for our enjoyment. As the all-inclusive Spirit, He has entered into us and dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) to be everything to us. Although we have received Christ, our receiving of Him goes beyond the initial receiving of Him once for all. On the contrary, we shall continue to receive Christ eternally. Receiving Christ can be compared to breathing. Just as breathing is a continual process, so our receiving of Christ should take place continually. If we do not receive Christ continually, we shall not enjoy the full benefit of the Christ we have received initially. Therefore, in addition to receiving Christ once for all for our eternal salvation, we need to receive Him consistently and continually as the One who is everything to us.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) Having Him Revealed in Them</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to God the Son by having the Son revealed in them (Gal. 1:16a). The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father (John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb. 1:3) is life to us (John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:5-6).</p>
<p>In Galatians 1:15a and 16a Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him. This indicates that to reveal the Son of God brings pleasure to God. Nothing is more pleasing to God than the unveiling, the revelation, of the living person of the Son of God.</p>
<p>It is significant that in Galatians 1:15 and 16 Paul does not say that God revealed <em>Christ</em> in him, but says that He revealed <em>His Son</em> in him. Speaking of Christ does not lead to the same kind of involvement as does speaking of the Son. The reason for this difference is that whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit. According to the writings of Paul, to have the Son is to have both the Father and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the Spirit for our enjoyment. Hence, when Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him, this means that the One revealed in him was the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the processed all-inclusive Spirit. Such a wonderful One has also been revealed in us that we may be joined to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Having Been Baptized into Him</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to God the Son also by being baptized into Him. Galatians 3:27a and Romans 6:3a tell us that we have been baptized into Christ. To be baptized into Christ equals to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit because the very Christ into whom we have been baptized is the embodiment of the Triune God. By being baptized into Christ we enter into an organic union with Him and thereby are joined to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) Having Put Him On</h2>
<p>As those who have been baptized into Christ, we have put on Christ. Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; To put on Christ is to be clothed with Him. In baptism we were immersed into Christ and put on Christ. On the one hand, Christ has been revealed in us; on the other hand, Christ has been put upon us. Hence, we have Christ both within and without. He is our center and also our circumference, our inside as well as our outside. Christ is our inward content and also our outward expression.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) Having Been Put into Him by God</h2>
<p>Speaking of God, 1 Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; God has put us into Christ, and now we are in Him. Formerly, we were in Adam, but we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ. This is not an outward transfer; it is an inward transfer of life. In life we have been transferred from one realm into another, from Adam into Christ. Now we can declare boldly that we are in Christ.</p>
<p>Being in Christ is a tremendous matter. Far from being a mere doctrine, this is a marvelous fact. We are in Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God. How marvelous it is that we are in Him!</p>
<p>What we believers, as the new creation, are and have in Christ is of God, not of ourselves. It is God who put us in Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ. It is God who has made Christ wisdom to us. God has transferred us out of Adam into Christ (2 Cor. 5:17) through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection (Gal. 2:20) and by our believing and being baptized (John 3:15; Gal. 3:26-28).</p>
<h2 class="head4">(7) Identified with Him</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the believers are joined to God the Son by being identified with Him. We are identified with Christ in His death, burial, being made alive, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) In His Death</h2>
<p>Romans 6:3b tells us that we have been baptized into Christ&rsquo;s death. Then Romans 6:6a goes on to say, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Galatians 2:20a says that we have been crucified with Christ, and Colossians 2:20a, that we have died with Him. Because we are in Christ, whatever He has passed through is our history. He has been crucified, and His crucifixion is ours. This is a glorious fact that we need to see. We should pray that the Lord will give us a clear vision of the glorious fact that we are in Christ and that we have been crucified with Him. Such a vision is basic to our knowing. God has accomplished the glorious fact of putting us into Christ, and we are identified with Him in His death. What Paul means by &ldquo;knowing this&rdquo; in Romans 6:6 is actually the seeing of a fact in a spiritual vision. Therefore, we should pray that the Lord will deliver us from contentment with a mere doctrinal understanding of our identification with Christ in His death and grant us a clear vision of this fact in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head5">(b) In His Burial</h2>
<p>Having been identified with Christ in His death, we have also been identified with Him in His burial. In Romans 6:4a Paul tells us, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism.&rdquo; Also, Colossians 2:12a reveals that we have been buried together with Christ in baptism. In this way we are identified with Christ in His burial.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) His Being Made Alive</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:5 says that we have been made alive together with Christ. As sinners we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness and justification, but as those who are dead in offenses and sins (Eph. 2:1) we need to be made alive. Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God&rsquo;s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas being made alive enables us, as the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him. God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself (Col. 3:4), into our deadened spirit through His Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). He has enlivened us with Christ. God enlivened us together when He enlivened the crucified Jesus. Therefore, He made us alive with Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:13a says, &ldquo;You, being dead in the offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;dead&rdquo; here refers to the deadness in spirit because of sin. We who once were dead in offenses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh have been made alive together with Christ. This means that God has enlivened us in Christ with the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(d) In His Resurrection</h2>
<p>We also have been identified with Christ in His resurrection. Romans 6:4b says, &ldquo;As Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:6a speaks of our having been raised up together in Christ. To make us alive is the initial step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life. Following this, God raised us up in Christ from the death position. Morever, Colossians 2:12b says that in Christ we were &ldquo;raised together through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from among the dead.&rdquo; Here we see clearly that in Christ we have been raised together through the faith of the operation of God. In Colossians 3:1 Paul again tells us &ldquo;you were raised together with Christ.&rdquo; We were raised together with Christ, and now we are where Christ is.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(e) In His Ascension.</h2>
<p>Finally, we have been identified with Christ in His ascension. Ephesians 2:6 tells us that God has &ldquo;seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;heavenlies&rdquo; refers not only to a place but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic. In Christ, God has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic. Because we are in a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly nature and characteristic, we are a heavenly people.</p>
<p>It was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies. This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it was applied to us by the Spirit of Christ when we believed in Him. Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(8) Grafted into Him<br />
as the Reality of the Cultivated Olive Tree</h2>
<p>The believers have been joined to the Son of God by being grafted into Him as the reality of the cultivated olive tree (Rom. 11:17). This cultivated olive tree is God the Father&rsquo;s unique interest in the universe. Christ is the reality of this divine interest, of this divine business, and we have been grafted into Him.</p>
<p>Being grafted into Christ as the reality of the cultivated olive tree leads to our growing in Him. Paul refers to this growth through grafting in Romans 6:5: &ldquo;If we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; A marvelous definition of the Greek word for &ldquo;grown&rdquo; in this verse is found in <em>Commentary on Romans</em> by Fredrick Lewis Godet. According to Godet (p. 243), the word grown denotes &ldquo;the organic union in virtue of which one being shares the life, growth, and phases of existence belonging to another.&rdquo; Through the organic union of two trees, accomplished by grafting, the one tree partakes of the life and characteristics of the other tree. Applying this understanding to our spiritual experience, we may say that we have been grafted into the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; of Christ, the Son of God, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Having become one with Him through grafting, we now partake of the life and characteristics of Him as the all-inclusive One, and in this way we grow in Him.</p><h2 class="head4">(9) Attached to Him<br />
as God&rsquo;s Anointed One by God</h2>
<p>The believers, as partners of Christ sharing His anointing (Heb. 1:9b), have been attached to Him as God&rsquo;s anointed One by God. Second Corinthians 1:21a speaks of &ldquo;He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;firmly attaches&rdquo; literally means establishes. This word can also be rendered &ldquo;firmly connects with.&rdquo; God establishes the apostles with the believers in Christ. This means that God attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, connecting the apostles and the believers to Christ, the anointed One. Hence, we share the anointing of Christ, which He has received of God.</p>
<p>In Greek, Christ means the anointed One. Christ, the anointed One, is full of anointing. In the universe there is only One who has been anointed by God, and this One is Christ, the anointed One. Because we have been attached to the universal anointed One, we have been anointed also. We are anointed by being attached by God to Christ, the anointed One.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(10) Joined to Him as One Spirit</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the word &ldquo;joined&rdquo; refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a union not only of the divine life but in the divine life. The organic union with the resurrected Christ can only be in our spirit.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;one spirit&rdquo; indicate the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and who is one with our spirit. Through resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and as such a Spirit He is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, the one spirit in 1 Corinthians 6:17 is the mingled spirit, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(11) Loving Him and Exulting in Him<br />
with Unspeakable and Glorified Joy</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:8, speaking of Christ, says, &ldquo;Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, not seeing at present yet believing, you exult with unspeakable and glorified joy.&rdquo; It is a wonder and a mystery that the believers love One whom they have not seen. The phrase &ldquo;in whom&rdquo; modifies believing. We love Him whom we have not seen because of believing, because of the faith that has been infused into us through hearing the living word (Gal. 3:2). Furthermore, the believers exult with unspeakable and glorified joy. Glorified joy is joy immersed in glory; hence, it is full of glory, that is, full of the Lord expressed.</p>
<p>Regarding the believers being joined to God the Son we have seen eleven matters: God having shined Him into our hearts; our having received Him; having Him revealed in us; having been baptized into Christ; having put on Christ; having been put in Christ by God; identified with Christ in His death, burial, being made alive, resurrection, and ascension; grafted into Christ as the reality of the cultivated olive tree; attached to Christ as God&rsquo;s anointed One by God; joined to the Lord as one spirit; and loving Him and exulting in Him with unspeakable and glorified joy. As a result of all these matters, we have been joined to God the Son, the embodiment of the divine Trinity, and now we are in Him. Praise the Lord for all the marvelous, divine items included in our being in Christ!</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(9)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall continue to see how the believers, in the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, are joined to the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. To God the Spirit as the Consummation<br />
of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>We have seen that, as believers, we have been joined to God the Father as the source of the divine Trinity and to God the Son, Christ, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Now we need to see that we have also been joined to God the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. This is indicated by Matthew 28:19b, which says that the believers are baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit here is the consummation of the processed Triune God, and we have been joined to Him. Giving a fuller definition of the Spirit, we may say that the Spirit is the processed, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. We have been joined to such a Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Having Received Him in Them Essentially</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to God the Spirit by receiving Him in them essentially. To receive the Spirit essentially is to receive Him into our being as our spiritual and divine essence. When we received the Spirit in this way, the Spirit came into us to be our spiritual life and being.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:2 Paul speaks of the believers&rsquo; receiving the Spirit essentially: &ldquo;This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?&rdquo; This verse indicates that we have received the Spirit by the hearing of faith. Through hearing the gospel we believed in the crucified Christ, but we received the Spirit. The One who was crucified was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit. This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. The believers received such a divine Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by works of law. The Spirit enters into the believers and lives in them through their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit we have received essentially is the processed Triune God. However, some may object to this statement and claim that the Spirit in Galatians 3:2 refers only to the Holy Spirit, the third of the Godhead, not to the Triune God. But according to the New Testament, especially Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, the Spirit we have received is the processed Triune God. Although God is eternal and unchanging, He has nevertheless passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Thus, the Spirit we have received is the very Triune God who has been processed for us. When we received this Spirit, we received the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. Therefore, to receive the Spirit is to receive the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) As the Spirit of Reality</h2>
<p>Essentially, the believers have received the Spirit as the Spirit of reality. In John 14:16 and 17 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; The very &ldquo;He&rdquo; who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very &ldquo;I&rdquo; who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality, as confirmed by 1 Corinthians 15:45b. The Spirit of reality is the reality of the divine Trinity. This means that the Father, the Son, and even the Spirit are realized in the Spirit of reality. Therefore, the whole Triune God, the complete Trinity, is realized in the Spirit of reality. Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we cannot have the divine Trinity or any of the divine attributes. The reality of the Triune God and His attributes is the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit is the reality of God, of the Son, and of every divine thing. He is also the reality of eternal life. Because the Spirit is the Spirit of reality, He is God, the Son, and eternal life. Because the Spirit is the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, and every divine matter, He is called the Spirit of reality.</p><h2 class="head5">(b) As the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>The Spirit received by the believers essentially is also the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for the Spirit contains the element of the divine life. Actually, the Spirit Himself is life. Therefore, with the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life, for these two actually are one. The fact that we cannot separate life from the Spirit is indicated by John 6:63, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Here the Lord Jesus connects the Spirit and life. If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life. But since we have received the Spirit, we have life, the eternal, uncreated life of God.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the Spirit of reality is the reality of the divine Trinity. The reality of the divine Trinity is mainly life. Life is the intrinsic essence of the divine Trinity. Hence, the Spirit is not only the Spirit of reality but also the Spirit of life. The Spirit is of life, and life is of the Spirit. Life is His content, and He is the reality of life, even life itself. We, the believers in Christ, have received the Spirit as the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) To Anoint Them</h2>
<p>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God anoints the believers. In particular, the Spirit anoints us with the reality of the divine Trinity as life.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, &ldquo;He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; Christ, the anointed One, is full of anointing. Because we have been attached to Him by God, we have been anointed by the Spirit. Now the Spirit moves in us, anointing the Triune God into us that His element may become our constituent.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:9b is another verse that indicates that the believers are anointed by the Spirit: &ldquo;Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s economy Christ has been anointed to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and we are Christ&rsquo;s partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and now we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>Two verses in 1 John speak of the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing the believers. First John 2:20 says, &ldquo;You have an anointing from the Holy One,&rdquo; and verse 27 says, &ldquo;The anointing which you received from Him abides in you.&rdquo; According to grammar, the word &ldquo;anointing&rdquo; is a gerund, a verbal noun, and as such conveys action. The anointing is the moving of the indwelling Spirit. Hence, the anointing is the function of the all-inclusive Spirit. Actually, according to 1 John 2:20-27 the anointing is the personification of the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. This all-inclusive Spirit came into us at the time of our regeneration and will abide in us forever.</p>
<p>In His economy, the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit. When the Triune God comes into our spirit, He is the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit, who dwells in our spirit, is now moving within us. This moving of the Spirit whom we have received essentially is the anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(d) To Seal Them</h2>
<p>The Spirit also seals the believers. In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul tells us that God has &ldquo;sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&rdquo; Ephesians 1:13 says, &ldquo;You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,&rdquo; and 4:30 says, &ldquo;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&rdquo; To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God. This implies that the seal of the Spirit is the expression of God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image signified by the seal. Therefore, when we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God, we bear the image of God, His expression.</p>
<p>The seal of the Spirit is not separate from His anointing. As we are under the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing which causes us to bear the image of God. When the Spirit anoints us, the anointing is the sealing. First, the Spirit through the anointing, adds the essence of the Triune God into us. Then the anointing seals us with this essence and makes us the image of God. This means that the anointing brings in the essence, and the sealing produces the image.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(e) To Pledge in Them</h2>
<p>In addition to anointing and sealing the believers, the Spirit pledges in them. Second Corinthians 1:22b speaks of &ldquo;the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts,&rdquo; and 5:5 says, &ldquo;He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit.&rdquo; Furthermore, Ephesians 1:14 tells us that the Spirit is &ldquo;the pledge of our inheritance.&rdquo; The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge, and the pledge is a guarantee that the Triune God is our inheritance. Because God is our inheritance, the Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us.</p>
<p>The pledge of the Spirit involves the moving of the Spirit within us. The Spirit is not only a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance; He is now pledging within us. This means that the pledge of the Spirit is not merely a once-for-all matter, because the Spirit is continually pledging within us. On the day we were saved the Spirit began to pledge in us, and this pledging continues day by day. Furthermore, this pledging of the Spirit involves the dispensing of the Triune God into us. As the Spirit pledges in our being. He dispenses Himself into us. Actually, the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing, sealing, and pledging all involve the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being.</p><h2 class="head5">(f) To Be the Firstfruit as the Foretaste<br />
of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit within us essentially is the firstfruit as the foretaste of the processed Triune God. Romans 8:23 says, &ldquo;We ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;firstfruit&rdquo; denotes the foretaste that is a guarantee that we shall experience the full taste. The processed Triune God is the full taste, and He has given us the Spirit as the firstfruit to be our foretaste. Within us we have the Spirit for our enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the foretaste of the coming full taste. What we are enjoying of the Triune God today is simply a foretaste; the full taste is yet to come. In eternity we shall enjoy the full taste of the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(g) To Be the Blessing as the Fulfillment<br />
of the Promise concerning the Gospel<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>Finally, the Spirit we have received essentially is the blessing as the fulfillment of the promise concerning the gospel of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Galatians 3:14 says, &ldquo;That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; This verse is extremely important, for it combines the promise of the Spirit with the blessing of Abraham. The blessing of Abraham was promised by God to Abraham (Gen. 12:3) for all the nations of the earth. This promise has been fulfilled, and this blessing has come to us in Christ through His redemption. As the context of Galatians 3:14 indicates, the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The blessing of the New Testament gospel, therefore, is not going to heaven, and it is not merely the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. The blessing of the gospel is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. As those who have been joined to the Spirit, we have received this blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Having Been Baptized in Him Economically</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we have received the Spirit into us essentially; on the other hand, we have been baptized in Him economically. In Mark 1:8b John the Baptist indicated that the Lord Jesus would baptize the believers in the Holy Spirit. In Acts 1:5b the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo; In Acts 11:16 Peter said, &ldquo;I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Whereas receiving the Spirit essentially is for living, being baptized in the Spirit economically is for ministry. The essential Spirit of life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of power is for carrying out Christ&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) As the Spirit of Power</h2>
<p>Economically the believers have been baptized in the Spirit as the Spirit of power. In Acts 1:8a the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.&rdquo; This refers to the baptism in the Holy Spirit (v. 5) for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father (v. 4). &ldquo;Upon you&rdquo; is different from &ldquo;in you&rdquo; (John 14:17). The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (John 20:22) to be the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) in them essentially. The same Holy Spirit came upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power economically.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the Father promised, through the prophet Joel, the coming of the Spirit economically (Joel 2:28-29). Then the coming of the Spirit was promised by the Son through His referring to the Father&rsquo;s promise: &ldquo;Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you&rdquo; (Luke 24:49). This promise was of the outpouring of the Spirit as power from on high for the believers&rsquo; ministry economically. In Acts 1:5 and 8 the Lord Jesus reminded the believers concerning the promise of the Father, telling them that they would be baptized in the Holy Spirit and thereby receive power, not strength or energy, which are matters related to life, by the Holy Spirit coming upon them.</p><h2 class="head5">(b) Poured Out on Them</h2>
<p>When the believers were baptized in the Spirit economically, the Spirit was poured out on them (Acts 2:18, 33b; 10:45). The same Spirit who was breathed into the believers essentially as life in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was poured out upon them economically by Christ in His ascension. In and after His ascension Christ received the all-inclusive Spirit from the Father economically and poured Him out upon the disciples for their ministry and work.</p>
<p>In John 20:22 the Spirit was breathed into the believers essentially to be their spiritual life and being. Now the Spirit Himself is the divine life within us. On the day of Pentecost, the same Spirit, in the aspect of God&rsquo;s economy, was poured out upon the believers not as life essentially but as power economically. God has an economy, an administration, an arrangement, that needs to be carried out. For the carrying out of His eternal economy, He poured the Spirit out upon the believers economically.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) Falling Upon Them</h2>
<p>When the Spirit was poured out upon the believers, He fell upon them. In Acts 1:8a the Lord Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would come upon us. In Acts 8:16 we see that, although the new believers in Samaria had received the Holy Spirit within them essentially when they believed in the Lord, &ldquo;He had not yet fallen upon any of them&rdquo; outwardly and economically. Furthermore, Acts 19:6 tells us that when Paul laid his hands on certain believers in Ephesus, &ldquo;the Holy Spirit came upon them.&rdquo; Concerning the breathing of the Spirit for life essentially, the Spirit enters into the believers. But concerning the outpouring of the Spirit as power economically, the Spirit falls upon the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(d) To Clothe Them</h2>
<p>Finally, the Spirit in whom we have been baptized economically clothes us. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&rdquo; This indicates that in addition to receiving the Spirit of life essentially, the believers still need to be clothed with power from on high, that is, to be empowered by the Spirit economically. As for the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as the breath (John 20:22). As for the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as the uniform, typified by the mantle of Elijah (2 Kings 2:9, 13-15). For this reason, some Bible teachers have called the Spirit of power the &ldquo;mantle Spirit,&rdquo; the Spirit as an outer coat. In Luke 24:49, as in 2 Kings 2, we have the thought of the mantle Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit of life and the Spirit of power, the mantle Spirit, are two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience. We see both aspects in 1 Corinthians 12:13. On the one hand, we have all been baptized in one Spirit; on the other hand, we have all been given to drink of the one Spirit. Drinking the Spirit inwardly is essential, and being baptized in the Spirit outwardly is economical. The inward aspect of the Spirit is for life essentially, and the outward aspect of the Spirit is for ministry and work economically. Through these two aspects of the one Spirit the believers have been joined to God the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>In this message and in the one previous, we have seen that the believers in Christ have been joined to the processed Triune God. Now we are one with the Triune God. We are one with the Father as the source, with the Son as the embodiment, and with the Spirit as the consummation. May we all see the marvelous fact that we have been joined to the processed Triune God and now are one with Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(10)</h1>
<p>Concerning the believers&rsquo; present, we have seen that the believers have been called, that they have been sanctified by the Spirit, that they have repented, and that they have believed, have been baptized, and have been joined to the processed Triune God. Now we shall see that, as a crucial part of their present, the believers have been redeemed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. Redeemed</h2>
<p>Many precious biblical terms, terms which are very important in the Word, have become common and religious. We may even say that they have been spoiled. The word &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; is an example of a biblical term that has become religious because of the way it is commonly used. Therefore, when we read this word in the Bible, we may not have much feeling within us concerning it.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; means to buy back something that originally was yours but has been lost. Redemption, therefore, means to repossess something at a cost. Originally we belonged to God; we were His possession. However, we were lost. Because God was not willing to give us up, He paid the price to get us back, repossessing us at a great cost. This is redemption. It was not a simple matter for God to redeem us, because our being lost involved us in sins and in many other things that are contrary to God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Many requirements were laid upon us&mdash;the demands of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory&mdash;and it was impossible for us to fulfill them. But God paid the price to redeem us and thereby repossessed us at a tremendous cost. This was accomplished when Christ died on the cross to obtain eternal redemption for us (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 10:12; 9:28). His blood obtained eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p>
<p>In Titus 2:14 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a people for His own possession, zealous of good works.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;for us&rdquo; in this verse mean on our behalf; they do not mean instead of us. To redeem means to buy with a price (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 Tim. 2:6). Christ gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:18 says, &ldquo;Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers.&rdquo; The blood of Christ (v. 19) has redeemed us from our vain manner of life. This vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life. According to most other references in Scripture, the blood of Christ redeems us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things (Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:15; Titus 2:14). In 1 Peter 1:18 and 19 we have an exception: Christ&rsquo;s blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness but on the manner of life. Chapter one of 1 Peter emphasizes the holy manner of life which God&rsquo;s chosen people should have in their sojourn. Not only is the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification for this; even Christ&rsquo;s redemption is for this&mdash;to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we pass the days of our sojourning in fear.</p>
<p>We may consider Christ&rsquo;s redemption a simple matter, thinking that it includes only the matter of Christ&rsquo;s dying on the cross and shedding His blood for our sins. However, redemption includes much more than this, for it is rich in content. This unique redemption is called eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). Christ&rsquo;s redemption is eternal because He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14). On the cross Christ offered Himself to God in a human body, which is a matter of time, but He did this through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity, without any limit of time or space. Hence, in the sight of God, Christ as the Lamb of God was &ldquo;slain from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (Rev. 13:8). His offering of Himself was once for all (Heb. 7:27), and the redemption consummated through His death has an eternal effect, covering the entire universe, including all of space and time. For this reason, God&rsquo;s people who lived before the death of Christ, as well as those who were born afterward, are covered by this eternal redemption. Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive and eternal death covers all believers without any limitation of space or time.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s eternal redemption includes many things. First, it includes our being bought by God. Then it includes the forgiveness of our sins and our being freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God. The sequence here is significant. For instance, reconciliation cannot be before justification. If we have not been justified, we cannot be reconciled to God. However, a certain aspect of sanctification precedes justification, whereas other aspects of sanctification follow justification. In a previous message we have pointed out that we would not have repented if the Holy Spirit had not come to sanctify us, to separate us unto God. This is the reason 1 Peter 1:2 speaks of &ldquo;sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Our repentance, therefore, was initiated by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. When God called us through the preaching of the gospel, the Holy Spirit worked on us in such a way that we repented. This aspect of sanctification comes before justification. Later we shall see that other aspects of sanctification follow justification. This means that after we are justified, we need further sanctification of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>According to my study of the New Testament, sanctification takes place in at least three junctures. First, we are sanctified before repentance. Then after we are baptized and before justification, we have further sanctification. After we are justified, we need yet the third aspect of the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification. Consider the sequence in 1 Corinthians 6:11, where Paul says, &ldquo;These things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&rdquo; According to this verse, we are first washed, then sanctified, and then justified. After justification, we are reconciled to God. The point we are emphasizing here is that seven matters are involved in our redemption&mdash;being bought, being forgiven, being freed, being washed, being sanctified, being justified, and being reconciled to God&mdash;and these are in a particular sequence.</p>
<p>The fact that redemption includes forgiveness is proved by Ephesians 1:7, where Paul says that in Christ &ldquo;we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses.&rdquo; Here the forgiveness of offenses is in apposition to redemption. This indicates that redemption is forgiveness and that forgiveness is redemption. The forgiveness of our offenses is the redemption through the blood of Christ. Although forgiveness is redemption, we cannot say that forgiveness includes redemption. Rather, we should say that redemption includes forgiveness, for redemption, and not forgiveness, is an all-inclusive matter. Therefore, forgiveness is a part of redemption. In the same principle, our being freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God are also included in Christ&rsquo;s redemption. From this we see that redemption is not a simple matter but is rich and all-inclusive.</p><h2 class="head3">a. By Being Bought</h2>
<p>The believers have been redeemed by being bought. First Corinthians 6:20a says, &ldquo;You were bought with a price.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) To Be the Slaves of Christ</h2>
<p>The believers have been bought to be the slaves of Christ. &ldquo;He who was called in the Lord when a slave is the Lord&rsquo;s freedman; likewise, he who was called when free is Christ&rsquo;s slave. You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men&rdquo; (1 Cor. 7:22-23). As those who have been bought by God, the believers inwardly should be slaves only of Christ; they should not become slaves of men.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) To Be the Possession, the Inheritance, of God</h2>
<p>The believers were bought not only to be the slaves of Christ but also to be the possession, the inheritance, of God. Ephesians 1:14 indicates that we are God&rsquo;s &ldquo;acquired possession.&rdquo; We, God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, the church, are God&rsquo;s possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28). Therefore, we are God&rsquo;s inheritance. Ephesians 1:11 tells us that &ldquo;we were made an inheritance.&rdquo; We were made God&rsquo;s inheritance for His enjoyment. For this reason, Ephesians 1:18 speaks of &ldquo;the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.&rdquo; First, God made us His inheritance as His acquired possession and also gave us to participate in all He is, all He has, and all He has accomplished as our inheritance. Consummately, all these become His inheritance in the saints for eternity. Because God has bought us, we are His inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) With a Price&mdash;the Blood of Christ</h2>
<p>We have been bought with a price, and this price is the blood of Christ. Revelation 5:9 says, &ldquo;You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.&rdquo; The blood that bought us was an extraordinary kind of blood&mdash;the blood of the God-man, Jesus Christ, the One whose life reached the highest standard. Only the blood of Christ was qualified and sufficient to redeem us, to purchase us. Christ&rsquo;s person is unique, and His blood also is unique. Because He is precious, His blood also is precious. No other blood can redeem us. Christ our Redeemer paid the highest price to purchase us&mdash;the price of His precious blood.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Paid to the Righteous Law of God</h2>
<p>The price of our redemption was paid to the righteous law of God. Paul&rsquo;s word in Galatians 3:13 indicates this: &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law.&rdquo; The law represents God&rsquo;s righteousness and makes absolute demands on man. The demands of the law confine sinners under condemnation. Christ bore our sins to fulfill the demands of the law. Therefore, the blood of Christ is able to redeem us from under the law so that the law will no longer confine us under condemnation.</p>
<p>Because the blood of Christ redeems us from the condemnation of the law, it also abolishes the distance between us and God. Thus, we are brought back to God. As sin and the law cause us to depart from God and become distant from Him, so the blood of Christ redeems us from under the law that we may return to God without anything between us and Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. By Being Forgiven of Their Sins</h2>
<p>The believers have been redeemed by being forgiven of their sins. Ephesians 1:7 tells us that in Christ &ldquo;we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses,&rdquo; and Colossians 1:14 says, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; The forgiveness of sins is the redemption which we have in Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death has accomplished redemption unto the forgiveness of our sins.</p>
<p>Redemption is what Christ accomplished for our offenses, and forgiveness is what Christ accomplished applied to our offenses. Redemption was accomplished on the cross, whereas forgiveness is applied the moment we believe in Christ. Actually, redemption and forgiveness are two ends of one thing. We have pointed out that the forgiveness of offenses is the redemption accomplished through the blood of Christ. However, two terms&mdash;redemption and forgiveness&mdash; are used because this one thing has two ends: the end of the accomplishment on the cross and the end of the application to us at the time we believed. Although redemption was accomplished on the cross when Christ shed His blood, it was not applied to us until we believed in Christ and made confession to the righteous God. At that very moment, the Spirit of God applied to us the redemption Christ had accomplished on the cross. Hence, redemption is the accomplishment, and forgiveness is the application.</p><h2 class="head4">(1) Having Their Sins Forgotten<br />
by God in His New Covenant</h2>
<p>Being forgiven of our sins means having our sins forgotten by God in His new covenant. Hebrews 8:10a says, &ldquo;This is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord.&rdquo; Then in verses 10 and 11 three crucial aspects of the new covenant are mentioned: the imparting of the law of life, the blessing of having God and of being His people, and the inward ability of knowing the Lord. Then verse 12 goes on to say, &ldquo;For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore.&rdquo; Hence, the last of the contents of the new covenant is propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and forgiveness of our sins. To be propitious is to make propitiation for our sins. Christ made propitiation for our sins to appease God&rsquo;s righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Based on this propitiation, God forgives our sins and even forgets them. In verse 12 we are told by the Lord, &ldquo;Their sins I will by no means remember anymore.&rdquo; Here we see that God forgets our sins. To forgive means to forget, for the forgetting of sins is the real forgiveness of sins. Without forgetting, forgiveness is not real. God not only forgives us our sins but also forgets our sins.</p>
<p>For God to forget our sins means that He regards us as never having sinned. Therefore, to forgive sins means to forget them, to think of them as never having existed. Not only has God put our sins away, but they have even vanished from His memory. In eternity the Father will be able to declare that He has many sons who have never sinned, for in His memory there is no such thing as sin. God has this kind of forgetting.</p>
<p>In the new covenant the primary blessing is the imparting of the divine life, which brings in the inner law of life, the blessing of having God and of being His people, and the inward ability of knowing the Lord. For God to do this. He had to be propitious to our unrighteousnesses and forget our sins. The propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgetting of our sins give Him the ground to impart His life into us. This is proved by the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in Hebrews 8:12. He imparts life to us, for He is propitious to our unrighteousnesses and forgets our sins.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention for His eternal purpose was to impart His life into man, but sin came in to frustrate this. In order to carry out His original intention, God made propitiation through Christ for our sins and granted us the forgiveness of sins so that He might impart the divine life into us for the fulfillment of His purpose. Therefore, in the new covenant life with its riches has been brought in, and our sins have been forgotten by God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Through the Blood of the New Covenant<br />
Poured Out by Christ for Many</h2>
<p>We have been forgiven through the blood of the new covenant poured out by Christ for many (Matt. 26:28). God&rsquo;s forgiveness must have a proper ground. Otherwise, He would be careless in forgiving people&rsquo;s sins. God does not forgive in such a way. On the contrary, God is righteous, and He does not forgive sins without a proper ground. The ground on which He forgives sins is the blood shed by Christ on the cross. For this reason, we must believe in the redeeming Christ. Because we believe in Him, God has the ground righteously to forgive us.</p>
<p>Matthew 26:28 says, &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and to His full blessing. The Lord&rsquo;s blood was required by God&rsquo;s righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins. Hebrews 9:22 says, &ldquo;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&rdquo; The shedding of Jesus&rsquo; blood signifies His death for us. The meaning of His shed blood is that God&rsquo;s righteous requirement is satisfied. Thus, the effect of His blood being shed is that our sins are forgiven. Without the shed blood of Jesus, God&rsquo;s righteous requirement could never have been satisfied, and man&rsquo;s sins could never have been forgiven. But the shed blood of Jesus has satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement so that man&rsquo;s sins can be forgiven.</p>
<p>Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin. Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness that the new covenant may be enacted. But Christ&rsquo;s blood has been shed for the forgiveness of sin, and the new covenant has been enacted with His blood (Matt. 26:28).</p>
<p>Some manuscripts insert the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; in Matthew 26:28. The Lord&rsquo;s blood, having satisfied God&rsquo;s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (Luke 22:20), a portion for us. The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion. The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) By the Believers&rsquo; Repentance and Faith in Christ</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; sins are forgiven by their repentance and faith in Christ. God forgives through the blood of Christ, and He forgives by our repentance and faith. Acts 2:38 speaks of repentance, and Acts 10:43 says, &ldquo;To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; In order to be forgiven, we need to repent. To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose. Literally, the Greek word for repent means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind. On the negative side, to repent before God is to repent not only of sins and wrongdoings but also of the world and its corruption that usurp the people whom God made for Himself, and also to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfilling of His purpose in making man. Therefore, it is a repentance unto God (Acts 20:21).</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that repentance is for forgiveness. This means that our repentance is not a natural repentance. Rather, it is a particular repentance from sin and all things other than God. To repent unto God is to turn to God and to His kingdom, to His ruling and authority. This is repentance for forgiveness, a repentance that brings us back to God Himself. By such a repentance we are forgiven of our sins.</p>
<p>In order to have forgiveness, we need not only to repent but to have faith in Christ. This is the reason Acts 10:43 tells us that those who believe in the Lord Jesus receive the forgiveness of sins. We have God&rsquo;s forgiveness by believing in Christ the Redeemer.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Forgiveness of Sins Is Given as a Gift<br />
by the Exalted Christ as a Leader and Savior</h2>
<p>Acts 5:31, referring to Christ, says, &ldquo;This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God&rsquo;s chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior. His sovereign ruling causes and leads Gods chosen people to repent, and His salvation based on His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>Repentance is for forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). On God&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption; on man&rsquo;s side, forgiveness is through repentance. Both repentance and forgiveness are major gifts given to us by the exalted Christ as a Leader and Savior. He is the only One qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had not given us the gift of repentance, we would not have repented. Actually, He compelled us to repent. This means that our repentance was not of us but was a gift given by the exalted Christ. Following repentance, we received the Lord&rsquo;s gift of forgiveness. How we thank Him for giving us repentance and forgiveness of sins!</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) Forgiveness Is a Main Item<br />
of the Proclamation of the Gospel<br />
in God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>The forgiveness of sins is a main item of the proclamation of the gospel in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In Luke 24:47 the Lord Jesus told the disciples that &ldquo;repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations.&rdquo; To preach the gospel is to proclaim the forgiveness of God through the redeeming blood of Christ by the believers&rsquo; repentance and faith. We need to tell others that God is ready to forgive their sins, and that in order to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness they need to repent and believe in Christ. This is to proclaim God&rsquo;s ready forgiveness as part of the good news, the glad tidings.</p>
<p>To proclaim the forgiveness of sins is actually to proclaim the jubilee. Luke 4:18 speaks of the release of the captives. To proclaim the forgiveness of sins is to proclaim the release of captives from slavery and bondage. According to the New Testament, the forgiveness of sins proclaimed in the gospel ushers the forgiven ones into the riches of the Triune God. Therefore, forgiveness of sins brings us into the enjoyment of the Triune God. For this reason, forgiveness is a main item of the proclamation of the gospel in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(11)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that the believers have been redeemed by being bought and by being forgiven of their sins. In this message we shall see that the believers have been redeemed by being freed, washed, and sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. By Being Freed&mdash;Released</h2>
<p>To be freed is to be released. God has forgiven us and has released us, for forgiveness involves releasing. Whenever a person is forgiven he is also released. Our God has forgiven us, and this means that He has also released us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) From God&rsquo;s Judgment&mdash;Condemnation</h2>
<p>First, we have been released from God&rsquo;s judgment, that is, from His condemnation. John 3:18 says, &ldquo;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&rdquo; Because all people are sinful, they all are condemned before God. God is righteous, and He cannot reckon those who have sinned as being without sin. As sinners, descendants of Adam, we have already been judged and thus are under God&rsquo;s condemnation and even His sentence. We have been sentenced to eternal perdition. But when God forgave us, He released us from His judgment and sentence.</p>
<p>Because God loves mankind, He laid our sins on His Son, who died on the cross as our substitute to be judged by God. Now those who believe in Christ are released from God&rsquo;s judgment. But those who do not believe in Him remain under God&rsquo;s condemnation and can only wait for eternal judgment and perdition.</p>
<p>We all were condemned in Adam through his sin. This means that we were judged at the same time Adam was judged. In other words, we were judged, condemned, before we were born. Since we are a part of Adam, we were judged when Adam was judged. No matter whether we are good or evil, we all, as a part of Adam, were under God&rsquo;s judgment before we believed in Christ. But &ldquo;God did not send the Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him&rdquo; (John 3:17). Here we see that Christ, the Son of God, was sent to save us from God&rsquo;s condemnation, which was brought in by the sin of Adam. Although we were condemned in Adam, we have been freed from this condemnation through Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Out of the Curse of the Law</h2>
<p>As redeemed ones, we have also been released out of the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13). God is merciful, but He is still just and has His law. The entire human race, however, is against His law and is breaking it. Therefore, the sinning race of mankind is under a curse, the curse of the law. This is the reason there are so many calamities, tragedies, and sicknesses, all of which are an indication that mankind is under the curse. But God is full of mercy, and He gives people a chance to repent. When we repented and were forgiven by God, we were released from the curse of the law.</p>
<p>As descendants of Adam, all sinners are under the curse. In Romans 5 we see that Adam brought us all under the curse. However, the curse was not made official until the law was given. Now the law declares that all the fallen descendants of Adam are under the curse. Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law. &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree&rdquo; (Gal. 3:13). Therefore, the curse that came in through Adam&rsquo;s fall has been dealt with by Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>The origin of the curse is man&rsquo;s sin (Gen. 3:17). The curse is carried out through the law, for the law administers the curse. Therefore, the curse is related to the law of God; it is the demand of the righteous God upon sinners. When Christ bore our sins, He also took our curse. Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law. Now, as believers, we are freed from the curse of the law.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) From God&rsquo;s Wrath</h2>
<p>The believers have also been freed from God&rsquo;s wrath. &ldquo;Having now been justified in His blood, we shall be saved through Him from the wrath&rdquo; (Rom. 5:9). In John 3:36 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.&rdquo; Furthermore, in 1 Thessalonians 1:10 Paul tells us, &ldquo;To wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from among the dead&mdash;Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.&rdquo; This wrath is the wrath of the coming judgment of God (Rom. 2:5-6, 8-9). Before we were saved, we were children of wrath (Eph. 2:3) under God&rsquo;s wrath. Today all of mankind is living under the wrath of God. Because God is merciful, giving people time to repent, His wrath has not yet burst forth. But those who refuse to repent will suffer God&rsquo;s thundering wrath. God is just, righteous, and one day the unbelievers will suffer wrath under His judgment. But because He has forgiven us, we have been released from His wrath.</p>
<p>John 3:36 says that the wrath of God abides on those who disobey the Son. Eternal life is in the Son of God, whereas wrath is according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. Those who believe in the Son of God will have eternal life. But those who do not believe in Him will remain under the wrath of God, which is like mighty thunder ready to roll. When the thunder of God&rsquo;s wrath rolls, people will perish.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) From the Fear and Slavery of Death</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil; and might release those who through fear of death through all their life were held in slavery&rdquo; (Heb. 2:14-15). These verses reveal that the believers have been freed from the fear and slavery of death. Because the Lord Jesus has destroyed the Devil who has the might of death, He has released us who were held in slavery through the fear of death. Death reigned over us (Rom. 5:14), and we were under its slavery with the fear of death all the time. Because the Lord has destroyed the Devil and abolished death (2 Tim. 1:10), we now have no more fear of death and are released from its slavery. We have been released by Christ from the slavery of sin, from the slavery of the fear of death, and even from the slavery of death itself. Praise the Lord that we are no longer enslaved by the fear of death! We are a liberated, released, emancipated, people. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption we have overcome the fear of death and have been freed from the slavery of death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. By Being Washed</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we have not only been forgiven and freed but also washed. To be forgiven settles our case before God. To be washed takes away the spot, the stain, of our sins. To be forgiven of our wrongdoings is one thing; to have the stain of our sins washed away is another. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God not only forgave us and released us but also washed us.</p>
<p>Forgiveness takes away the legal obligation, whereas washing removes the stain of our sinfulness. God&rsquo;s washing takes away, abolishes, the stain of our sins. Our sins need God&rsquo;s forgiveness, and the stain of our sins requires His cleansing. In redemption we have both forgiveness and cleansing.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s washing of the believers is of two aspects. First, we are washed positionally by the blood of Christ. Second, we are washed dispositionally in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Positionally by the Blood of Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(a) Before God</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:5 speaks of the Lord Jesus as the One &ldquo;who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood.&rdquo; To loose us from sins means to wash us from sins. This washing of our sins is before God positionally.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) In Their Conscience</h2>
<p>The believers have also been washed positionally by the blood of Christ in their conscience. &ldquo;How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God&rdquo; (Heb. 9:14). To serve the living God requires a blood-purified conscience. The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God. The conscience is the leading part of our spirit, and the living God always comes to our spirit by touching our conscience. He is righteous, holy, and living. Hence, our defiled conscience needs to be purified so that we may serve Him in a living way. Therefore, in our conscience we have been washed positionally by the blood of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">(2) Dispositionally</h2>
<p>Although we have been washed positionally by the blood of Christ before God and in our conscience, we still need the second aspect of God&rsquo;s washing. We need to be washed dispositionally. This dispositional washing is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, in His person, and in the Spirit. The blood of Christ washes us outwardly before God and in our conscience. Through His blood we have a conscience without offense, for His blood has washed away the stain of our sins. For this reason, our conscience does not respond to God&rsquo;s condemnation. Because God forgives us, our conscience also releases us through the outward washing of Christ&rsquo;s blood. Nevertheless, in our disposition, in our nature, there are many unclean things that require a subjective washing. This subjective washing is a dispositional washing, not by the blood of Christ but in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit. After we have been washed positionally by the redeeming blood of Christ, we need to be washed daily in our disposition in the name of the Lord and in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Because we have been defiled by sins outwardly and by our old nature inwardly, we need both a positional and dispositional washing. Day by day, we still have the old nature, and often we are defiled by it. Just as our physical bodies are made unclean by the dirt outside them and by the perspiration that issues from within them, so we, in our spiritual being, are unclean both outwardly because of sin and inwardly because of our old nature. These two kinds of defilement require two kinds of cleansing, or one cleansing with both the positional and dispositional aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) In the Name (Person) of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:11 says, &ldquo;These things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&rdquo; Here washing is not by the blood in an objective way, for this is the subjective washing of regeneration as in Titus 3:5. This was accomplished in us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, in the person of the Lord, in an organic union with Him through faith.</p>
<p>It is not easy to understand how we can be washed in the Lord&rsquo;s name. If Paul had said that we were washed in the precious blood of Christ, this would be much easier to understand. But what does it mean to be washed in the Lord&rsquo;s name? At the time a person believes in the Lord Jesus and receives Him, he is washed in the blood of Christ. However, this washing is objective. The believers also need to experience a subjective washing. We did experience this immediately after we were saved. This subjective washing is not in the blood but in the name of the Lord Jesus. Such a washing causes us to have a living that is clean and pure.</p>
<p>In the New Testament &ldquo;in the name of the Lord&rdquo; actually means in the Lord Himself, for the name denotes the person. When we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we experience the person of the Lord. Because the Lord is a living person, not merely a name, whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we call on His person. He is real, living, present, and available. When we call on Him, He responds. At the time we were saved, we probably called on the Lord&rsquo;s name spontaneously and unconsciously, without being taught to do this. In this name, which is the reality of the living person of Christ, we were washed dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) In the Spirit</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, we are also washed dispositionally in the Spirit. The name is the person, and the person is the Spirit. We cannot separate the name of the Lord from His Spirit, for the Spirit is His person. Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John indicate that the Lord&rsquo;s name cannot be separated from the Spirit. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Lord comes, but when He comes to us, He is the Spirit. Paul certainly experienced this. He knew that when He called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Lord came to Him as the Spirit. Then in the name and in the Spirit he experienced a dispositional washing. This also was our experience when we called on the Lord&rsquo;s name and contacted the Spirit, who is the person denoted by this name. If we continue to call on the name of the Lord, enjoying His name and His Spirit, we shall daily experience a dispositional washing.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) By Faith</h2>
<p>The dispositional washing is by faith. In Acts 15:9 Peter says, &ldquo;He made no distinction at all between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s word about the cleansing of our hearts by faith indicates that God does not care for outward legalistic ordinances which cannot cleanse man&rsquo;s inner being; rather, He cares for the inward cleansing of man&rsquo;s heart. This corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s emphasis in Mark 7:1-23. The cleansing of man&rsquo;s heart can only be by the Holy Spirit with the divine life, not by outward ordinances by dead letters. Such a cleansing certainly is by faith.</p><h2 class="head3">e. By Being Sanctified</h2>
<p>The believers are also redeemed by being sanctified. In Greek the word rendered &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo; is actually a verbal form of the word for holiness. The word for holiness is <em>hagios,</em> and the verb that means sanctified is <em>hagiazo.</em> To be sanctified, therefore, is to be made holy.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) By Faith in Christ</h2>
<p>The believers are sanctified by faith in Christ. Acts 26:18 speaks of &ldquo;those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo; This sanctification is not only positional but also dispositional. To be sanctified positionally is to have a change in position and usage; to be sanctified dispositionally is to be transformed in nature by and with the holy nature of God. Positionally and dispositionally we are sanctified by faith in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) In Christ</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul speaks of those who have been &ldquo;sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; To be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.</p>
<p>To be sanctified in Christ first means that we are put into Christ. Christ is a holy sphere, a sphere of holiness. Not only is Christ holy&mdash;Christ Himself is holiness. Because God has put us into this Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), we have been put into the sphere of holiness. Now that we are in Christ as the sphere of holiness, we are sanctified. Furthermore, since to be sanctified is to be made holy, to be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be made holy in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) Positionally</h2>
<p>Sanctification, like washing, has both a positional and a dispositional aspect. Sanctification first means a change of position. Originally, our position was worldly and not at all for God. But when we were separated unto God, our position was changed, and, as a result, we became holy. This is to be sanctified positionally.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) By Jesus the Redeemer</h2>
<p>The One who sanctifies us positionally is Jesus the Redeemer. &ldquo;Wherefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate&rdquo; (Heb. 13:12). This verse speaks of positional sanctification and indicates that this sanctification is accomplished by Jesus the Redeemer.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) Through His Blood</h2>
<p>Jesus the Redeemer has sanctified us positionally through His blood. The blood of Christ separates us unto God, makes us holy, positionally. However, because His blood is not able to accomplish anything in us with respect to the inner life, it can sanctify us only positionally but not dispositionally. Through Christ&rsquo;s blood we have been separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Dispositionally</h2>
<p>Although sanctification is a positional matter and thereby involves separation from a worldly position to a position for God, sanctification is also a dispositional matter. This means that sanctification is not only a change of position but also a change of disposition. Therefore, the sanctification revealed in the New Testament includes dispositional transformation in addition to positional change. Through dispositional sanctification the believers are being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) By Him Who Sanctifies<br />
</em><em>with His Holy Nature and Who Is Out of the Same<br />
One Father as the Sanctified Are</h2>
<p>Dispositionally we are sanctified by Christ, the One who sanctifies with His holy nature and who is out of the same one Father as the sanctified are. &ldquo;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers&rdquo; (Heb. 2:11). He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3). Both the firstborn Son and the many sons are the same in the divine life and nature.</p>
<p>Christ, the One who sanctifies us with His holy nature, has entered into us and has become our life. He imparts His holy nature to us, and this nature becomes the sanctifying element within us. This means that the indwelling Christ sanctifies us dispositionally with His holy nature. This is not the outward sanctification through His blood; this is the inward sanctification by the divine life with the Lord&rsquo;s holy, divine nature.</p>
<p>He who sanctifies us with His holy nature is of the same one Father as the sanctified are. As the firstborn Son, Christ is of the Father, and we, the many sons of God, are also out of the same Father. Therefore, He and we are of the same Father. Both He and we have come out of the same source. Within Him there is a holy nature, and this holy nature is also within us, for He and we are of the same Father, the same source.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) In the Name (Person) of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, we are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The name of the Lord denotes His person. Hence, to be sanctified dispositionally in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is to be sanctified in His person, that is, to be sanctified in the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) In the Spirit</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:11 also tells us that we are sanctified in the Spirit. We need to see the connection between the name of the Lord, the person of the Lord, and the Spirit. From experience we know that when we call on the name of the Lord, we get the person of the Lord, and that the person of the Lord is the Spirit. We are sanctified dispositionally in the Spirit as the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s person. When God put us into Christ, Christ&rsquo;s Spirit came into us. Now we are sanctified not only in Christ but also in the Spirit, that is, in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Being sanctified dispositionally in the Spirit is actually a matter of the dispensing of the Spirit into us. This means that sanctifying is equal to dispensing. Through experience we have come to realize that the Holy Spirit is the sanctifying Spirit. This Spirit dispenses His element into us, and this dispensing of the Spirit is the sanctifying of the Spirit. The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus and experience the Spirit, the more we are sanctified dispositionally in the Spirit by the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:13 Paul speaks of &ldquo;sanctification of the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit is in us to sanctify us with the divine element, which is the nature of God. This sanctification of the Spirit is actually the divine transformation. The Spirit indwells us with one goal&mdash;to sanctify us dispositionally. Day by day we are being inwardly sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(12)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall see that, as redeemed ones, the believers have been justified and then reconciled to God in the first step. Because we have been bought, forgiven, freed, washed, and sanctified, we have no problems before God. Thus, God is fully positioned to justify us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">f. By Being Justified</h2>
<p>For us to be justified by God means that we are approved by God according to His standard of righteousness. No matter how righteous we may be in ourselves, we cannot be approved by God according to our righteousness. Our righteousness will never justify us before God. We may justify ourselves according to our standard of righteousness, but this does not enable us to be justified by God according to His standard. However, when God justifies us, we are approved by Him according to His standard of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Objectively</h2>
<p>The believers are justified by God both objectively and subjectively. To be justified objectively is to be justified outwardly and positionally.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) Freely by God&rsquo;s Grace<br />
through the Redemption in Christ Jesus</h2>
<p>Romans 3:24 says, &ldquo;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Here we see that we are justified freely by God&rsquo;s grace. Grace is something freely given of God or done by God, and it is the expression and manifestation of God&rsquo;s love. By His grace God has freely justified us. Hence, justification is a free gift.</p>
<p>Although we are justified by God&rsquo;s grace, we are justified through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. This means that because God is righteous, He must have a proper ground to justify us by His grace. Apart from Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God would not have the ground to justify us. For this reason, Christ&rsquo;s redemption is needed. God&rsquo;s love caused Him to have grace on us, and His righteousness caused Him to accomplish redemption for us through Christ. Therefore, our being justified is a matter both of God&rsquo;s grace bestowed on us and God&rsquo;s righteousness accomplished for us. Justification, then, is the grace of God to save us according to His righteousness.</p>
<p>God can justify us, approving us according to the standard of His righteousness, because the work of justification is based on the redemption of Christ. When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified. If there were no such redemption, it would be impossible for us to be justified by God. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is the basis of God&rsquo;s justification.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s righteousness has been shown to the New Testament saints in His justifying them because Christ has paid the price for our sins and has accomplished the full redemption to meet all of God&rsquo;s requirements. Because of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God, in order for Him to be just, must justify us. On God&rsquo;s side justification is by His righteousness; on our side justification is by His free grace as compared with justification by the work of the law. To be justified by the work of the law we need to work, but to be justified by the redemption in Christ there is no need of our work, for it is freely given by His grace. We do not deserve it, but God is bound by His righteousness to justify us because of the redemption of Christ, which meets all His requirements.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) By the Faith of Christ,<br />
That Is, by Believing in Christ</h2>
<p>The believers are justified by the faith of Christ, that is, by believing in Christ (Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:26, 28, 30). Although Christ died to accomplish redemption and God has the ground to justify us and is ready to forgive us, we cannot be justified unless we believe in Christ. Just as a child needs to eat the food prepared by his mother, so we need to receive all that God has prepared for our justification. We receive this by believing in Christ.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:16 says, &ldquo;Knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus; we also have believed in Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by works of law, because by works of law no flesh shall be justified.&rdquo; Under God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we are not to keep the law. On the contrary, we are to be justified by faith in Christ. No flesh, no fallen human being, can be justified by works of law. The requirement of God&rsquo;s law is perfect, but the works of man are imperfect and defiled. Therefore, no one can be justified according to his own works. However, the redemption of Christ is entirely according to the requirement of the law, and Christ&rsquo;s redemption also satisfies the requirement of the law. This means that the redemption of Christ enables us to be justified by God. Because the works of the law are not dependable, but the redemption of Christ is dependable and sure, justification must not depend on our works but upon the redemption of Christ. In order for us to depend on the redemption of Christ, we must believe in Christ and His redemption. In other words, we must receive Christ and His redemption. This is to be justified by faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 3:26 says, &ldquo;For the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus.&rdquo; Verse 28 goes on to say, &ldquo;We reckon that a man is justified by faith without works of law.&rdquo; Verse 30 says, &ldquo;Since it is one God who shall justify the circumcision out of faith and uncircumcision through faith.&rdquo; Faith is the source for the circumcision to be justified by God, so it is out of faith. But for the uncircumcision to be justified by God, faith is the way, so it is through faith. These verses clearly reveal that the believers in Christ are justified by faith.</p><h2 class="head6">i) The Faith of Christ Being Christ Himself<br />
Entering into the Believing Ones<br />
to Be Their Believing Element and Ability</h2>
<p>Romans 3:22 speaks of the faith of Jesus Christ, and verse 26, of the faith of Jesus. Some Bible students say that the faith of Jesus Christ refers to our act of believing in Jesus Christ, and others claim that this refers to the faith of Jesus, that the faith of Jesus becomes ours. I prefer to say that genuine believing is to believe in the Lord Jesus by His faith, even by Him as our faith. Our faith is actually the Lord Jesus believing within us. Therefore, the phrase &ldquo;through faith of Jesus Christ&rdquo; means believing in Jesus Christ by His faith.</p>
<p>The faith of Christ is actually Christ Himself, the One who has entered into the believing ones to be their believing element and ability. Such faith is reckoned to the believing ones as righteousness by God (Rom. 4:22-24). This means that God considers this kind of faith a righteous act. In ourselves we are sinners and do not have any righteousness before God. But if we take God&rsquo;s word, stand on it, and obey it, and if we believe in His Son Jesus Christ, God will count our believing in His Son according to His word as righteousness. We can have this righteousness easily. We simply need to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus. God will regard this as the highest righteousness, and we shall be justified with this righteousness. The more we believe in Christ, the greater will be our sense that God is pleased with us. This is a matter of the righteousness of God being reckoned to us as the issue of our faith in Christ.</p>
<p>When Christ comes into us as the believing ones, He becomes our faith. Then God reckons our faith as righteousness. In this way we have faith and righteousness, both of which are actually Christ Himself. Christ is the faith by which we believe in Him, and He is also the righteousness which God reckons to us.</p>
<h2 class="head6">ii) Believing in Christ Being the Way to Be Justified</h2>
<p>Believing in Christ is the way to be justified. Acts 13:39 says, &ldquo;From all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; &ldquo;This One&rdquo; is the Lord Jesus, the One who was resurrected to be our Savior. Actually, the One by whom we are justified is Himself in resurrection as our justification. Now the way for us to be justified is to believe in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) To Receive the Righteousness<br />
of God, Which Is Christ</h2>
<p>When we are justified by God objectively we receive the righteousness of God, which is Christ. Romans 3:22 speaks of &ldquo;the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The righteousness of God is what God is with respect to justice and righteousness. Whatever God is in His justice and righteousness constitutes His righteousness. Furthermore, all that God is in His righteousness is actually Himself. Therefore, the righteousness of God is God Himself, not merely a divine attribute. Although we are justified with the righteousness of God (Phil. 3:9) and have received this righteousness, we actually have Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). God has made Christ, the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness. Therefore, the righteousness which we have received is Christ Himself. The very person of Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(d) Evidenced</h2>
<h2 class="head6">i) By the Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>The fact that we have been justified by God is evidenced by the resurrection of Christ. Romans 4:25 says that Christ &ldquo;was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification.&rdquo; The death of Christ fully satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ&rsquo;s death. His resurrection is an evidence that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death. In the resurrected Christ we are accepted by God. Therefore, Romans 4:25 says that Christ was raised because of our justification.</p>
<p>The proof of God&rsquo;s justification is the resurrected Christ. Suppose Christ had died for our sins and was buried in the tomb but was not resurrected by God. If this were the situation, we could not believe that His death was accepted by God and that it satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. However, Christ is not in the tomb. God raised Him up from among the dead as an evidence that God has accepted His death for us and that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements.</p>
<p>Romans 10:9 is a further proof that we are justified in and by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection: &ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo; Do you believe that the Lord died for you, or do you believe that God has raised Him from the dead? Of course, you believe in both. However, you may be surprised to know that not one word in the Scriptures says that we ought to believe that the Lord has died for us. Rather, we must believe that God has raised Him from the dead; for we may believe that the Lord has died and yet not believe that He was raised from the dead. If you believe that the Lord has been raised from the dead, this surely implies your faith in His death. Everybody believes that the Lord died, but revelation is needed to believe that the Lord has been resurrected. In Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God. Romans 4:25 says that He was raised because of our justification. Justification includes the fact that God has resurrected Christ, accepted Him, and that God has been satisfied with His redemptive death.</p><h2 class="head6">ii) By the Ascension of Christ</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; being justified by God is also evidenced by the ascension of Christ. In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will convince the world &ldquo;concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father.&rdquo; This indicates that the Father has been fully satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive death and has accepted Him in His resurrection. The proof that the Father is satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s redemption is that the Father resurrected Him from among the dead and exalted Him to His right hand. Hence, the resurrection and ascension of Christ are the evidences proving that His redemption has satisfied God and has met all the demands and requirements of God for our justification. Therefore, the Lord Jesus was released from death to he exalted to the heavens at the right hand of God. One of our hymns speaks of this:</p>
<p class="hbody">&ldquo;Father God, Thou hast accepted<br />
Jesus as our Substitute;<br />
Judged the Just One for the unjust,<br />
Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?<br />
As a proof of perfect justice,<br />
At Thine own right hand He sits;<br />
He, as Thy full satisfaction,<br />
Righteously Thy need befits.&rdquo;<br />
(<em>Hymns,</em> 20)</p>
<p>Thus, the ascended Christ, who sits at the right hand of God, is an evidence that we, the believers in Christ, have been justified by God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Subjectively</h2>
<p>We have seen that the believers have been justified objectively, that is, outwardly and positionally. Now we need to see another aspect of God&rsquo;s justification, and this is the subjective aspect. To be justified by God subjectively is to be justified by Him inwardly and dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(a) By Receiving the Divine Life<br />
through the Positional Justification</h2>
<p>The believers are justified subjectively by receiving the divine life through the positional justification. Being justified objectively gives us the position to receive the divine life. This is the reason Romans 5:18 speaks of &ldquo;justification of life.&rdquo; Because we have been justified objectively, we have been brought up to the standard of God&rsquo;s righteousness and now we correspond to it. Hence, we are justified unto life spontaneously. In Adam we were condemned unto death, but in Christ we are justified unto life. Justification is for life. Justification changes our outward position and life changes our inward disposition. Now we have both justification for our position and life for our disposition.</p>
<p>Justification issues in, results in, life. We have received the divine life, and this life is now working in us to make us righteous in many things. This is an inward, subjective justification. Through such a subjective justification, our being and living are justified by the divine life within us. Therefore, God justifies us not only objectively from without but also subjectively from within.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) By Christ in His Resurrection</h2>
<p>We are also justified subjectively by Christ in His resurrection (Rom. 4:25b). As the resurrected One, Christ is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. The resurrected Christ is now living in us a life that is absolutely righteous, a life that can be justified by God. This is not outward justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption; rather, this is inward justification by Christ&rsquo;s life. Christ&rsquo;s redemption gives us objective justification by faith, but His resurrection life within us gives us the subjective justification by God. Now God is positioned by Christ&rsquo;s blood to justify us outwardly, and He is also positioned by the resurrected Christ to justify us inwardly.</p><h2 class="head5">(c) In the Name (Person) of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:11 reveals that we are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is not justification by Christ&rsquo;s blood in an objective way but subjective justification in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in the organic union with Him through faith. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are justified subjectively and dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(d) In the Spirit</h2>
<p>Furthermore, according to 1 Corinthians 6:11 we are justified subjectively in the Spirit. Our being justified in the Spirit involves the dispensing of the Spirit into us. The Spirit dispenses His essence into us and thereby justifies us, makes us acceptable to God, dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head3">g. Reconciled to God in the First Step</h2>
<p>Originally, we were not only sinners but also enemies of God. Enmity is the greatest problem between man and God. Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself. We were reconciled to God when we believed in the Lord Jesus. By faith we have received God&rsquo;s justification and reconciliation by faith.</p>
<p>As believers we have been redeemed by being reconciled to God in the first step. Second Corinthians 5:19 and 20 show that reconciliation has two steps. In verse 19 it is the world that is reconciled to God. In verse 20 it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God, who are to be reconciled further to Him. This clearly indicates that there are two steps for us to be fully reconciled to God. In the first step we, as sinners, are reconciled to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross to be judged by God upon Him for us. The second step is that, as believers living in the natural life, we need to be reconciled to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we may live to Him in the resurrection life (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21) to be judged and done away with by God so that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. By these two aspects of His death the Lord Jesus has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God.</p>
<p>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called the screen (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing the screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God, who is in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that he might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. Many believers have been reconciled to God in the first step, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. But because they still live in the flesh, they need to pass the second veil, which has been rent already (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20), to enter in through the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is reconciliation in the second step. Because of the need for believers to have the second step of reconciliation, Paul, in 2 Corinthians 5:20, says, &ldquo;Be reconciled to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first step of reconciliation was accomplished when we believed in the Lord Jesus. At the time we were forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, and justified, God reconciled us to Him in position. However, in disposition we are still against God in many ways and in many things. For this reason, we need further reconciliation. In this message we shall be concerned only with being reconciled to God in the first step, leaving the second step for a later message.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) As the Enemies of God,<br />
That Is, Sinners in the World</h2>
<p>As the enemies of God, that is, as sinners in the world, we have been reconciled to God. Romans 5:10a says, &ldquo;While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 5:19a says that &ldquo;God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.&rdquo; Once we were enemies of God, but we have been reconciled to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) In Christ, That Is, through Christ</h2>
<p>We have been reconciled to God in Christ, that is, through Christ. According to 2 Corinthians 5:19a, God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. Colossians 1:20a, speaking of Christ, says, &ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Through Him&rdquo; means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was processed.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) Through the Death of God&rsquo;s Son<br />
as the Propitiation for the Believers&rsquo; Sins,<br />
with the Blood of His Cross</h2>
<p>Paul in Romans 5:10 tells us that we were reconciled through the death of God&rsquo;s Son, and in Colossians 1:20 we see that this reconciliation was &ldquo;through the blood of His cross.&rdquo; We were reconciled to God in the first step through the death of God&rsquo;s Son as the propitiation for the believers&rsquo; sins. First John 2:2 says, &ldquo;He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. In Him as our Substitute, through His vicarious death, God is satisfied and appeased. Hence, Christ is the propitiation between God and us (1 John 4:10). Hebrews 2:17 tells us that Christ made propitiation for our sins. The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to appease God&rsquo;s righteousness and thereby to reconcile us to God by satisfying the demand of His righteousness. Since Christ made propitiation for our sins, 1 Corinthians 15:3 says plainly, &ldquo;Christ died for our sins.&rdquo; Through His death, with the shedding of His blood on the cross, we have been reconciled to God in position.</p>
<p>The problem of being an enemy is even more serious than the problem that necessitates propitiation. Sinners need propitiation; enemies need reconciliation. Propitiation mainly deals with sins, whereas reconciliation deals with enmity as well as sins. Therefore, reconciliation includes propitiation. Romans 5 tells us that before we were saved we were both sinners and enemies. As sinners we needed propitiation, and as enemies we needed reconciliation. Herein lies the difference between propitiation and reconciliation: propitiation is for sins; reconciliation is both for sins and enmity.</p>
<p>Reconciliation is based on Christ&rsquo;s redemption (Rom. 5:10, 11) and was accomplished through God&rsquo;s justification (2 Cor. 5:18-19; Rom. 5:1, 11). Hence, reconciliation is the issue of redemption with justification.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Having Peace toward God</h2>
<p>As those who have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, we have peace toward God. Reconciliation with justification issues in peace. &ldquo;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 5:1). Having reconciled us to God, Christ has &ldquo;made peace through the blood of His cross&rdquo; (Col. 1:20b).</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) To Be Saved in the Life of God&rsquo;s Son</h2>
<p>We have been reconciled to God in the first step in order to be saved in the life of God&rsquo;s Son. &ldquo;If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life&rdquo; (Rom. 5:10). Reconciliation to God through Christ in the first step has been accomplished already, but to be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life from so many negative things is still a daily matter. Yes, we have been forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God in the first step. However, there are still many things from which we need to be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life. On the one hand, we have been reconciled to God; on the other hand, we still need to be saved in the life of God&rsquo;s Son.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(13)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">8. Made a New Creation</h2>
<p>Concerning the believers&rsquo; present, we have covered God&rsquo;s calling, the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification, and our repentance, our believing, and our being baptized. We have also seen that the believers have been joined to the Triune God and redeemed. Now we need to see that, as believers in Christ, we have been made a new creation. First, God called us, separated us, and turned us to Him. Then we repented, believed, and were baptized. As a result, we have been redeemed and joined to the Triune God to be made a new creation.</p>
<p>The most crucial matter in God&rsquo;s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation. Our being made a new creation is, therefore, a vital part of God&rsquo;s salvation. We may even say that God&rsquo;s making us a new creation is the lifeline of His salvation.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;new creation&rdquo; is not a symbol. Rather, this is an expression conveying the plain and real fact that we have been saved to be made a new creation. Furthermore, this new creation, like the old creation, is not something individual but something corporate. In the old creation God did not create millions of men; on the contrary, He created one man, Adam, who includes all men. The principle is the same with God&rsquo;s new creation. In the new creation we all are parts of the new man (Eph. 2:15), the church, composed of the many sons of God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to make us a new creation, and this new creation is composed of sons. In a very practical sense, the corporate sonship is God&rsquo;s new creation. Those in the old creation are sons of Adam in the fall. But through God&rsquo;s redemption, regeneration, and dispensing of Himself into us, we who once were sons of Adam have now become sons of God. Here in this divine sonship we are corporately the new creation.</p>
<p>There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation. God&rsquo;s life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature. Although the old creation came into being through the work of the mighty God, He Himself does not reside in it. Hence, the first creation has no divine content. The divine nature does not dwell in the old creation, and that is why it has become old. Adam did not have the life of God or the nature of God. We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit. When we believed in Christ, God&rsquo;s life and nature were imparted to us and caused us to become a new creation.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.&rdquo; Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation. The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature. This is of God through our faith in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:26-28).</p>
<p>The words, &ldquo;Behold, they have become new,&rdquo; are a call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation. The word &ldquo;they&rdquo; refers to the old things. The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Hence, the believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:15 says, &ldquo;Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.&rdquo; The old creation is our old man in Adam (Eph. 4:22), our natural being by birth, without God&rsquo;s life and the divine nature. The new creation is the new man in Christ (Eph. 4:24), our being regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), having God&rsquo;s life and the divine nature wrought into us, with Christ as its constituent (Col. 3:10-11). It is this new creation that fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose by expressing God in His sonship. Whereas circumcision is an ordinance of the law, the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature. Circumcision is of dead letters; the new creation is of the living Spirit. Hence, it avails. The Son of God who has been revealed in us (Gal. 1:16) enlivens us and makes us a new creation, and the Christ who lives in us (Gal. 2:20) affords us the riches of His life to live the new creation. Therefore, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation with Christ as its life.</p>
<p>The new creation spoken of in Galatians 6:15 is the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God. The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it. We who have been generated by the Spirit of God are still God&rsquo;s creation, but we are now His new creation. However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit. Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation. Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation.</p>
<p>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God. Apart from such a union, we shall remain in the old creation. But now, by the organic union with the Triune God, we are in the new creation. Here in the new creation neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything or avails anything. As believers in Christ, we are the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head3">a. By Being Regenerated</h2>
<p>The believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated. Regeneration causes us to become a new creation, something which has the element of God within it. The old creation has nothing of the divine element in it. That is why it is old and decaying. Originally, we did not have God&rsquo;s element; therefore, we were the old creation. It was not until God&rsquo;s element was added into us that we became a new creation. This is what regeneration has accomplished in us. Regeneration causes us to have God&rsquo;s life and His very element, thereby making us a new creation. This new creation is a marvelous mystery, for it is the mingling of God and man. As the most wonderful thing in the universe, the new creation has both the human and divine elements. By regeneration God&rsquo;s element was added into us, and we became a new creation.</p>
<p>Since we are made a new creation by being regenerated, we need a clear and accurate understanding of regeneration. To be regenerated simply means to receive the divine life in addition to our human life. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is for man to be a vessel to contain the divine life. Our being with our human life is a vessel to contain God as life. God&rsquo;s goal is that we receive the divine life as our real life. This is the meaning of regeneration.</p>
<p>Regeneration is not a matter of outward improvement; neither is it merely a change or conversion without life. Regeneration is a rebirth which brings in a new life, the divine life. We received the human life from our parents. In regeneration we received the divine life from God. Hence, regeneration means to have the divine life in addition to the human life.</p>
<p>Regeneration requires another birth in order to possess another life. Hence, regeneration also means to be born again or born anew. Originally we were born of our parents, but now we are born once more, this time of God (John 1:13). The Bible calls this experience being born again. When we were born of our parents, we obtained human life. When we were born of God, we obtained the divine life, God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>We need to be regenerated because of two conditions. From the negative side, we need to be regenerated because our life has been corrupted and has become evil and cannot be improved from evil to good (Jer. 17:9; 13:23; Rom. 7:18). From the positive side, we need to be regenerated because we do not have the life of God. Of all God&rsquo;s creation, man has the highest development of life. Yet man still needs to receive another life for his completion. He needs the uncreated, eternal life of God. When Adam was created, he obtained only created life. He did not at that time obtain God&rsquo;s uncreated life. Likewise, when we were born of our parents, we obtained only the natural, created human life. However, God&rsquo;s purpose is that we obtain His uncreated life and be transformed by this life into His image to be like Him. Even if our human life had not been corrupted by the fall, we would still need to be regenerated. In Genesis 1 and 2 Adam was without sin, yet he was void of God&rsquo;s life. Thus, God placed him before the tree of life that he might receive the life of God and be regenerated. From this we see that God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man was not merely to have a sinless man but to have a God-man, one who has God&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<p>Our need for regeneration is of two aspects, a lower aspect and a higher aspect. The lower aspect is that our life is corrupt and cannot be changed. The higher aspect is that for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose we need to receive God&rsquo;s life. Apart from our original, human life, God puts His life into us. This is regeneration.</p>
<p>By regeneration we not only obtain God&rsquo;s life, but we are also made one with God. God the Spirit enters our spirit and causes us to be joined to Him as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). What a marvelous and deep relationship this is! Now in at least one part of our being&mdash;our spirit&mdash;we are one with God. This oneness of God is deepened and increased by the transformation of our soul, and it will reach its full development by the glorification of our body, which will cause even our body to be one with God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) By God the Father according to His<br />
Purpose and His Great Mercy</h2>
<p>The believers have been regenerated by God the Father. By regenerating us, God the Father enlivens us with His life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with Him. Through regeneration God imparts His life into us. We all have been born of the divine life. This is to be regenerated by God.</p>
<p>As believers, we have been regenerated by God the Father according to His purpose and His great mercy. James 1:18, speaking of God, says, &ldquo;Having purposed, He brought us forth.&rdquo; This refers to the divine birth, our regeneration, which is carried out according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The fact that God purposed means that He brought us forth of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose by begetting us.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:3a says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us.&rdquo; Here we see that regeneration is according to God&rsquo;s great mercy. God&rsquo;s mercy is more far reaching than His grace. Grace extends only to a situation that corresponds to it, but mercy goes much further, reaching to a situation that is poor and unworthy of grace. According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace and eligible only to receive His mercy. We were so poor and pitiful that there was the need for God&rsquo;s mercy to extend to our fallen condition. God&rsquo;s mercy has reached us, and according to it we were regenerated by God.</p><h2 class="head4">(2) Through the Resurrection of Christ<br />
from among the Dead</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:3 reveals that our regeneration took place &ldquo;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.&rdquo; It is crucial for us to realize that we were regenerated when Christ was resurrected. This means that, in the sight of God, we were regenerated before we were born, since Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was our regeneration. Before we became part of the old creation through our natural birth, we were already a part of the new creation through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Thus, our regeneration was accomplished once for all more than nineteen centuries ago. In our experience we may have been reborn some years ago, but from the divine perspective our regeneration was fully accomplished when Christ was resurrected. Our experience of regeneration is based fully upon the fact that it has already been accomplished through the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Thus, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection Christ imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and in nature. This is the basic factor of our regeneration.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was a birth both for Him as the firstborn Son of God and for us as the many sons of God. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ may be considered a universal delivery, a universal birth. In this birth Christ as the firstborn Son of God and the believers as the many sons of God were brought forth. Of course, as the only begotten Son, Christ was the Son of God from eternity past. Nevertheless, in His humanity He was born as the firstborn Son of God through His resurrection. It was through this resurrection that the believers were regenerated by God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) Of the Water of Baptism<br />
to Terminate the Old Man</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ are regenerated of the water of baptism to terminate the old man. In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus tells us that we need to be &ldquo;born of water and the Spirit.&rdquo; Here water refers to the water of baptism, which terminates and buries our old man. After our old man has been terminated and buried, we can be reborn as part of the new creation.</p>
<p>Water is the central sign of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to bury and terminate people of the old creation. In his ministry John the Baptist came to baptize with water. He told people that they had to repent and realize that they were fallen and good for nothing except burial. Those who heard John&rsquo;s preaching and repented were baptized in water. This means that as sinful, fallen men of the old creation, they were being terminated.</p>
<p>John also told people that his ministry was for the ministry of the Lord Jesus. The termination of our old life is for the germination of the divine life within us. The center of the ministry of the Lord Jesus is the Spirit, that is, to germinate people with a new life in the new creation.</p>
<p>Regeneration, then, is to terminate people of the old creation with all their deeds and to germinate them in the new creation with the divine life. Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a sinner who is good only for burial, he is accepting John&rsquo;s ministry. After repenting, he must believe in the Lord Jesus and accept His ministry of life in order to be germinated. This is to be terminated by John&rsquo;s ministry through water and to be germinated by Jesus&rsquo; ministry through the Spirit. This is what it means to be born of water and of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) To Be Washed from All the Old, Negative Things</h2>
<p>The believers have been regenerated to be washed from all the old, negative things. This washing is the &ldquo;washing of regeneration&rdquo; spoken of in Titus 3:5. The Greek word for &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; here is different from that for born again in 1 Peter 1:23. The only other place this word is used is in Matthew 19:28 for the restoration in the millennium. In Titus 3:5 this word refers to a change from one state of things to another. To be born again is the beginning of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation to make us a new man. The washing of regeneration organically and metabolically purges away the old things of our natural life and of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&mdash;the divine essence of the new creation&mdash;into our being. In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us throughout our life until the completion of the new creation.</p><h2 class="head4">(5) Of the Spirit to Generate the New Man</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ have been regenerated of the Spirit to generate the new man. John 3:5 says, &ldquo;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Here we see that regeneration requires two elements&mdash;water and Spirit. On the negative side, the water terminates us; on the positive side, the Spirit germinates us, thereby generating the new man. In this way we experience a new birth and become a new being. Birth always produces a being. When a child is born, a new being is produced. Likewise, when we were regenerated of the Spirit, we were enlivened to become a new being.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit (John 3:6). Before regeneration our spirit was dead (Eph. 2:1). But at the time we believed in Christ, God&rsquo;s Spirit came into us and mingled with our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:16). Thus, our spirit obtained God&rsquo;s life and was made alive. Whereas our parents gave us our natural birth, the Spirit has given us our spiritual birth.</p>
<p>In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The Lord spoke this word in reply to what Nicodemus had said in verse 4: &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo; In verse 6 the Lord makes it clear that the new birth has nothing to do with the flesh. To be born again, to be regenerated, is to be terminated and to have a new being produced. What is terminated is of the flesh, and what is generated to become the new being is of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Regeneration of the Spirit is the beginning of the new man within us. All our experiences of spiritual life are matters of the new man, who begins within us at the time of our regeneration. Before we were regenerated, we were in Adam, a fallen sinner, an old man. Once we were regenerated, God&rsquo;s life in Christ entered into us. This life is a new element, and when it mingles with our spirit, it becomes the new man within us.</p>
<p>In John 3:8 the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo; The Greek word for wind, <em>pneuma,</em> is the same word as for spirit. Whether it means wind or spirit depends on the context. A regenerated person, a person born of the Spirit, is like the wind, which can be realized but which is beyond understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) From Above</h2>
<p>The believers have been regenerated from above. John 3:3 says, &ldquo;Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;anew&rdquo; can also be rendered &ldquo;from above.&rdquo; We have not only had an earthly birth; we have also been born from above, from the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(7) In the Believers&rsquo; Spirit</h2>
<p>Regeneration takes place in the believers&rsquo; spirit. &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6). This indicates that regeneration is of the Spirit in our spirit. The divine Spirit regenerates the human spirit with the divine life. Regeneration, that is, receiving the divine life, is a matter that takes place in our spirit, not in our body or soul. The function of the human spirit is to contact God. Our spirit was made by God for the purpose that one day we would exercise it to contact Him and receive Him into our being. In our spirit we have been regenerated of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Regeneration takes place in the realm of our spirit. Regeneration takes place in the human spirit by the Spirit of God with the divine life. Hence, regeneration is not a birth of the flesh that brings forth flesh; it is a birth of the Spirit, God&rsquo;s Spirit, that brings forth spirit, our regenerated spirit. Flesh is our natural man, our old man, our outward man, born of our parents, who are flesh. But spirit, our regenerated spirit, is our spiritual man, our new man, our inward or inner man (2 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 3:16), born of God, who is Spirit (John 4:24). When we were born of our parents, we were born flesh. When we were born again of God the Spirit, we were born spirit. The nature of the flesh is born human, but the nature of the spirit is born divine. Before we were regenerated, we lived by our flesh and had our being in our flesh. By regeneration the divine life was imparted to our spirit by the Spirit of God, and our spirit was made alive, regenerated.</p><h2 class="head4">(8) To Receive the Eternal Life&mdash;<br />
the Divine Life&mdash;as the Seed of God</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ have been regenerated to receive the eternal life&mdash;the divine life&mdash;as the seed of God (John 3:15-16; 1 John 5:11-13; 3:9). Regeneration is a rebirth which brings in a new life, eternal life. Regeneration, therefore, is absolutely a matter of life, not a matter of self-improvement. We received the human life from our parents. In regeneration we received the divine life from God. This means that by regeneration eternal life, the very life of God, was imparted to us. The moment we were regenerated the divine life came into us.</p>
<p>The primary thing we receive through regeneration is the life of God. All of the capabilities, functions, and activities of a living being originate with its life. Even its appearance and outward expression are determined by its life. God has the highest life. All that God is and all that is in God are in the life of God. The nature of God is also contained in the life of God. This life we have received through regeneration.</p>
<p>To be regenerated is to receive another life, eternal life, the life of God. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we did not have this divine life. But from the time we believed in Him and called on His name, we have had the life of God. When we were regenerated, the divine life was imparted to us to make us a new being. With our old being we have the natural life, and with the new being we have the divine life. What we were was of the old life, the human life. What we have received through regeneration is a new life, the divine life.</p>
<p>The divine life received through regeneration is the seed of our new being. Speaking of the one who has been begotten of God, 1 John 3:9 says, &ldquo;His seed abides in him.&rdquo; The seed here denotes God&rsquo;s life, which we received of Him when we were begotten of Him. This life as the divine seed abides in every regenerated believer. This seed is actually the Triune God Himself. In regeneration the Triune God was sown into us as the seed of life. The believer has the divine seed in his spirit. It is a marvelous fact that this seed of God now abides in us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(9) Through the Living and Abiding Word of God,<br />
the Word of the Divine Reality<br />
as the Incorruptible Seed</h2>
<p>The believers have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God, the word of the divine reality, as the incorruptible seed. First Peter 1:23 says, &ldquo;Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&rdquo; This verse indicates that we have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God. We have not been regenerated of corruptible seed. A seed is a container of life. The word of God as the incorruptible seed contains God&rsquo;s life. Hence, it is living and abiding. Through this word we have been regenerated. It is God&rsquo;s living and abiding word of life that conveys God&rsquo;s life into our spirit for our regeneration.</p>
<p>We have been regenerated of the organic, divine seed through the divine word. Actually, the Triune God is the seed. In our experience, however, the Triune God as a seed is conveyed in His word as a seed. Therefore, the word as the seed conveys the Triune God as the seed, and by receiving the word we were reborn.</p>
<p>God is mysterious and abstract, and for this reason it is difficult for us to receive Him. But the abstract, mysterious God is embodied in the word, which has been preached to us. When we heard the word and received it, we received God, who is embodied in the word. The embodiment of God in the word is the very seed of life sown into our being for our regeneration.</p>
<p>James 1:18 tells us that God &ldquo;brought us forth by the word of truth.&rdquo; The word of truth is the word of the divine reality, the word of what the Triune God is (John 1:14, 17). This word is the seed of life by which we have been regenerated. When we heard the gospel, we heard the word of God&rsquo;s reality. When we received this word, we were reborn. Through this divine birth the divine life was imparted into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(10) To Be the Children of God</h2>
<p>The believers have been reborn to be the children of God. &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo; (John 1:12-13). To be regenerated is to be born of God, and to be born of God is to have the life of God, that is, the eternal life. If we have the life of God, we are the children of God, for the life of God gives us the authority, the right, to become the children of God, because by this life we have the nature of God and a life relationship with Him. Since regeneration means to be born of God, it automatically causes us to become the children of God. Now we are God&rsquo;s children, and He is our Father.</p>
<p>We have been begotten of the Father, the source of life, to be the children of God. It is the greatest wonder in the universe that human beings can be begotten of God and that sinners can be made children of God. Through regeneration, an amazing divine birth, we have received the divine life, the eternal life. This life, obtained from God through regeneration, enables us to be His children. Now the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom. 8:16). Even at times when we are weak or backsliding we still have the deep conviction that we are children of God, for once we have been born of God we are His children forever.</p>
<p>Regeneration involves an eternal birth relationship that cannot be dissolved. No birth can be reversed. No one can become unborn once he is born. Just as this is a fixed principle in physical life, it is even more solid and substantial in the spiritual realm. Once we are born of God, we are eternally His children, regardless of our condition. Though we may turn away from the Lord temporarily, the birth relationship can by no means be terminated. This great fact gives us much confidence and boldness in the face of failure and sin. No failure can terminate the birth relationship we have with God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(11) To Be the Firstfruit of God&rsquo;s New Creation</h2>
<p>James 1:18 says, &ldquo;Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.&rdquo; Here we see that we have been regenerated to be the firstfruit of God&rsquo;s new creation. God&rsquo;s new creation is organic, altogether a matter of life, and the regenerated believers are the firstfruit of this new creation. God will renew His entire creation to have a new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center (Rev. 21:1-2). He first regenerated us to be the firstfruit of His new creation by imparting the divine life into our being through the implanted word of life. This life will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the living center of God&rsquo;s eternal new universe.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(12) Unto a Living Hope,<br />
a Hope of Life, Even the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 1:3 we are told that we have been regenerated unto a living hope. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;unto&rdquo; means issuing in, resulting in, with a view to. God has regenerated us with a view to a living hope. This is not a hope of objective things; it is a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings.</p>
<p>God the Father has regenerated us with a view to a living hope, the hope that every part of our being and everything related to us will be enlivened. Everything related to an unsaved person is dead. But with one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living.</p>
<p>When we were sprinkled with the blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:2), immediately the life-giving Spirit came into us to enliven us. Using the word &ldquo;life&rdquo; as a verb, we may say that the Spirit came in to &ldquo;life&rdquo; us. Formerly we were dead and altogether without hope, but we have been &ldquo;lifed&rdquo; through the life-giving Spirit unto a living hope. Now we have the hope that every part of our being will be lifed. This is the living hope.</p>
<p>A living hope is a hope of life. In particular, it is a hope of eternal life. Life is the source of hope. For example, a little child has human life. Because he has life, his parents are full of hope concerning his growth and development. At birth he weighed several pounds, but his mother is expecting him to grow to maturity as a man. Her hope is a hope of life. We could not have such a hope in relation to something that is not living, for hope depends on life. We have been born of the divine life, which is a life full of marvelous hope. We do not know to what extent the divine life within us will develop, but we have a living hope concerning this.</p><h1 class="series"> THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(14)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that the believers are made a new creation by being regenerated. In this message we shall go on to see that the believers are made a new creation by receiving the Spirit of God and by having the eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. By Receiving the Spirit of God</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ are made a new creation not only by being regenerated but also by receiving the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is God Himself for our experience and enjoyment. God the Father is the source, God the Son is the course, and God the Spirit is the application. Therefore, the Spirit of God is God reaching us and applied to us as our portion. Regarding the Spirit of God, we need to realize that the Spirit of God is actually God Himself reaching us and being applied to us.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:2 speaks of receiving the Spirit: &ldquo;Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?&rdquo; Through hearing the gospel, we have believed in Christ, but we have received the Spirit. The One who was crucified for us was Christ, but the One who enters us is the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. The believers receive this Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law.</p>
<p>We believe in the crucified and resurrected Christ, but we receive the Spirit. The title of the One in whom we believe is Christ, not the Spirit. However, when we believe in Christ, we receive the Spirit. Christ is the One who was crucified for the accomplishment of redemption and who was resurrected. Hence, we believe in Him. But when He comes into us, He comes in as the Spirit. Therefore, as believers, we have received the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel (Gal. 3:14).</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) The Essential Spirit</h2>
<p>In being made a new creation, the believers have received the essential Spirit. Here the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; refers to existence, to being, and to life for existence. To receive the essential Spirit is to receive the Spirit as life for our spiritual being, existence, and living. We have received the Spirit essentially for our spiritual existence as regenerated believers in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) The Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we have received the Spirit as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) but also the Spirit of life. The Greek word for &ldquo;life&rdquo; in Romans 8:2, <em>zoe,</em> denotes God&rsquo;s life, the divine, uncreated, eternal life. The Spirit is the Spirit of such a life. The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life. Actually, the Spirit Himself is life. Therefore, the way to have the divine life is the Spirit. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. The Spirit and life are one, for we cannot separate life from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from life. By receiving the Spirit as the Spirit of life we have been made a new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) To Seal Them</h2>
<p>The Spirit has come into us to seal us (Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22). To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. When we were saved. God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out and to indicate that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image signified by the seal. This seal indicates that God is our owner and that we belong to Him.</p>
<p>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God. This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God and brings God&rsquo;s image into our being. When we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon us, we bear the image of God and the expression of God.</p><h2 class="head4">(4) To Be the Pledge<br />
within Them of the Divine Inheritance</h2>
<p>The Spirit received by the believers is also the pledge within them of the divine inheritance (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5). The pledge of the Spirit, which is actually the Spirit Himself as the pledge, is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us. Thus, the Spirit within us is the pledge of God being our portion in Christ. The Greek word for &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; in Ephesians 1:14 and in 2 Corinthians 1:22 and 5:5 also means foretaste, guarantee, a part payment that guarantees the full payment. Because God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge of this inheritance. God gives the Spirit to us not only as a pledge of our inheritance but also a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.</p>
<p>On the day we were saved, God began to pledge Himself to us. The pledge of the Spirit involves movement within us. This means that the Spirit is not only a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance but that He is now pledging within us. This pledging continues day by day. Furthermore, the pledging of the Spirit, which is given to us for our enjoyment and encouragement involves the dispensing of the Spirit into us. Therefore, the pledging of the Spirit is actually the dispensing of the Spirit. This dispensing makes us a new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) To Dwell in Them</h2>
<p>The Spirit has come into the believers to dwell in them. In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us. For the Spirit to dwell in us means that He makes His home in us. The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 is not the same as the Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2, where He was brooding upon the face of the waters. The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 now dwells in the tripartite man and is now the Spirit of Christ, who possesses humanity as well as divinity. In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God had not yet gone through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The Spirit of God in Romans 8, however, is the Spirit of life who in Christ has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these elements have been compounded with the Spirit of God, who has come into us to dwell in us. Through the indwelling of the Spirit we have been made a new creation.</p>
<p>As the Spirit indwells us, He is not idle. Rather, He is active to impart life to us. According to Romans 8, the Spirit gives life to our spirit (v. 10), our soul, represented by the mind (v. 6), and our body (v. 11). Therefore, the indwelling Spirit is imparting the divine life into our tripartite being. Actually, the purpose of the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling is to dispense life, which is God Himself, into the three parts of our being, into our spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p>Another verse that refers to the Spirit dwelling in the believers is 1 Corinthians 6:19: &ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&rdquo; Because the Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16) and our spirit is within our body, our body has become a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit. As the Spirit indwells us, He dispenses the Triune God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) To Be the Reality of Christ within Them</h2>
<p>The Spirit has come into the believers to be the reality of Christ within them (John 14:17, 20; 15:26; 16:12-15). The all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is fully realized as the Spirit who dwells within us. The indwelling Spirit is the reality, the very realization, of Christ.</p>
<p>In John 14:17; 15:26; and 16:13 the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality. The reason the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality is that whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, reality had not yet entered man. The reality was present, for Christ Himself is reality (John 14:6). But this reality was only among the disciples; it had not yet come into them. Therefore, the Lord told them that it was expedient for them that He go away (John 16:7). The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit. As soon as this change had been accomplished, His reality would become the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit would become the Spirit of reality. Then this Spirit of reality would come to abide in the disciples to be in them the reality of Christ. Because the Spirit of reality has come into us, the reality of Christ now abides in us.</p>
<p>The Spirit of reality is the full realization of the Son. After the Spirit has brought us to salvation and has regenerated us, He will become in us the very reality of the Son Himself. Whatever the Son is, has, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained will all be fully wrought into us through the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit becomes the realization of the Son. He is the reality of all that the Son is and has.</p>
<p>John 16:13 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&rdquo; The Spirit of reality does not guide the believers into the doctrine concerning Christ; the Spirit guides them into reality. This reality is nothing less than Christ Himself. Thus, the Spirit of reality will bring us into all the reality of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">c. By Having the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>We have seen that the believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated and by receiving the Spirit of God. Now we must go on to see that the believers have been made a new creation also by having the eternal life. The word &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; means uncreated, without beginning or ending, unchangeably existing. As believers in Christ, we have eternal life, the divine, uncreated life of God.</p>
<p>The word eternal denotes not only the duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also the quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God. This life is also eternal with respect to its sphere. Therefore, the word eternal denotes three things: time, space, and quality. As to the element of time, this life will last forever. As to space, to sphere, this life is vast, unlimited. As to quality, eternal life is perfect and complete, without defect or shortage. The sphere or field of eternal life encompasses the whole universe. Eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather, it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space. Furthermore, eternal life, which is the divine life, has no defects and no shortages.</p>
<p>Eternal life is the life of God (Eph. 4:18). We may say that this life is actually God Himself. Moreover, this life is of the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:2), especially when it becomes our life for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) The Life of God, Which Was:</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(a) From the Beginning</h2>
<p>Eternal life is the life of God, and the life of God was from the beginning: &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life&rdquo; (1 John 1:1). This verse indicates that the life of God was from the beginning. Here &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; differs from &ldquo;in the beginning&rdquo; in John 1:1. &ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo; traces back to eternity past before creation, whereas &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; proceeds forward from creation. Furthermore, in 1 John 1:1 the phrase &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; is used in an absolute sense as in John 8:44; 1 John 2:13, 14; and 3:8, not in the relative sense as in John 15:27; 1 John 2:7, 24; 3:11; and 2 John 5 and 6.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) With the Father</h2>
<p>First John 1:2 tells us that this eternal life &ldquo;was with the Father.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;with&rdquo; is <em>pros</em> (used with the Greek accusative case). It is a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with. The eternal life was not only with the Father, but was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity. The Father is the source of the eternal life, from whom and with whom the Son was manifested as the expression of the eternal life for those the Father has chosen to partake of and enjoy this life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(c) Manifested to the Apostles</h2>
<p>The eternal life, the life of God, was manifested to the apostles. &ldquo;The life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us&rdquo; (1 John 1:2). This manifestation of the eternal life was through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, which is emphasized strongly in the Gospel of John (John 1:14). Such a manifestation, corresponding to the Word of life being touchable (1 John 1:1), indicates the substantial nature of the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, which is the manifestation of the divine life in the New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The manifestation of eternal life includes revelation and impartation of life to men, with the view to bringing man into the eternal life, into its union and communion with the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) The Life Which Is in the Son of God</h2>
<p>Eternal life is the life which is in the Son of God. &ldquo;This is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (1 John 5:11-12). The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son. His Son is the means for God to give us His eternal life. Because the life is in the Son and the Son is the life (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4), the Son and the life are one.</p>
<p>If we have the Son of God, we have eternal life because eternal life is in the Son. We may say that the Son is the container of eternal life. When we receive the Son by believing in Him, we have eternal life.</p>
<p>Eternal life, the divine life, is the &ldquo;capital&rdquo; of our Christian life. Actually, this eternal life is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, eternal life is not a thing; it is a person who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Another verse which indicates that eternal life is in the Son is John 1:4: &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Him&rdquo; in this verse denotes the Word, who was God and through whom all things came into being (John 1:1, 3). The Word, which is the expression and explanation of God, contains God as our life. Therefore, eternal life can be found only in the Word as the expression of God. When we receive the Word, we receive the life within it. The Word is the expression of God, and the life is the content of God. When we receive the Word, we receive God&rsquo;s content as life and are thereby born of God and become the children of God (John 1:12-13).</p><h2 class="head4">(3) The Free Gift of God in Christ</h2>
<p>Eternal life is the free gift of God in Christ. Romans 6:23b tells us, &ldquo;The free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; First John 5:11 says, &ldquo;God gave to us eternal life,&rdquo; the life that is in His Son. Therefore, the divine life has been given to us as the free gift of God in Christ. Because this gift of God is a present, it requires no work in return. The gift of eternal life from God was given to us in Christ Jesus. Because God put His life in Christ Jesus to be given to us, our receiving of the Lord Jesus is the receiving of the gift of eternal life that is in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Received by Faith</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we have received eternal life by faith (John 3:16, 36; 6:47; 5:24). In John 6:47 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;He who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word translated &ldquo;in&rdquo; means into. To believe into the Lord Jesus is not the same as to believe Him (John 6:30). To believe Him means to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him means to receive Him and be united with Him as one. It is by believing into Him that the believers have eternal life.</p>
<p>The words of the Lord Jesus in John 3:16, 36 and 6:47 emphasize the fact that the way for us to have eternal life is simply to believe in Christ. Having eternal life is absolutely a matter of faith. No matter how much we can work or how good our work may be, we cannot have eternal life by our work. Our work does not count in this matter&mdash;only faith counts. It is by faith, by believing in the Lord Jesus, that we receive eternal life, the life of God, for our regeneration. The Lord Jesus has done everything necessary for us to have eternal life. We do not need to do anything except believe in Him and in what He has accomplished.</p>
<p>After passing through death and entering into resurrection, the Lord has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Now, in resurrection, He is the Spirit of life, with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe in Him. Once we believe in Him, we receive the Spirit of life, that is, the Lord Himself, with the eternal life of God. Therefore, it is by believing in the Lord with His all-inclusive work that we receive eternal life, God&rsquo;s life, and are born of Him to be His children.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) Assured by the Word of God</h2>
<p>Our having eternal life is assured by the Word of God. First John 5:13 says, &ldquo;I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.&rdquo; The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers, who believe in the name of the Son of God, that they have eternal life. Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the Holy Writings are the assurance concerning this fact. They are the title deed of our eternal salvation. We are assured and have the pledge by them that because we believe in the name of the Son of God we have eternal life.</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is the pledge of eternal life. The Bible is also the title deed of our salvation. This is why the Bible is called a covenant or testament. We not only have the fact of eternal life; we also have the pledge, the guarantee, the title deed, to prove that we have eternal life. We thank the Lord that we have eternal life and also the title deed to prove it.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) Having the Eternal Life,<br />
They Shall by No Means Perish Forever</h2>
<p>Having the eternal life, the believers shall by no means perish forever. In John 10:28 and 29 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; The eternal life is for the believers&rsquo; living. Both the Son&rsquo;s hand as the hand of power and the Father&rsquo;s hand as the hand of love are for the believers&rsquo; protection. Eternal life will never run out, and the hands of the Son and the Father will never fail. Therefore, the believers are eternally secured, and they will never perish.</p>
<p>As long as we have eternal life, we have eternal security. Not only do we have eternal life, but we have two hands&mdash; the Son&rsquo;s hand of power and the Father&rsquo;s hand of love. These hands embrace us, and Satan is not able to snatch us away. We are eternally secured by the divine life and by these two divine hands.</p>
<p>Our salvation is eternally secured by the life of God. Do you believe that the eternal life can be recalled once it has been given to us? To say that once we are saved we can be lost again means that the eternal life which has been given to us can be called back. This is illogical. Once we have eternal life, we shall never perish.</p>
<p>Among Christians today, there are two main schools of theology regarding salvation. One school, Calvinism, says that salvation is eternal. According to Calvinism, once we have been saved, we are saved eternally. Salvation can never be lost. The second school, Arminianism, claims that if we are not careful after being saved, we might be lost again. Arminianism teaches that a person may be saved and lost again and again. According to the Scriptures, and in particular according to John 10:28 and 29, it is altogether wrong to say that after a person has been saved he can lose his salvation. Because the believers have received eternal life, they cannot lose their eternal salvation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the truth concerning eternal salvation needs to be balanced by the truth concerning dispensational reward or punishment during the coming age of the kingdom. It is absolutely correct that God has chosen us and predestinated us for eternal salvation and that our salvation cannot be lost. After we have been saved, however, we need to bear an amount of responsibility by God&rsquo;s sufficient grace and by our cooperation with Him through the enjoyment of His grace. Otherwise, during the coming kingdom age we shall have dispensational punishment instead of dispensational reward. In the book of Hebrews there are five warnings related to the dispensational punishment of the kingdom (2:1-4; 3:7&mdash;4:13; 5:11&mdash;6:20; 10:19-39; 12:1-29). The Arminians wrongly apply these warnings to eternal perdition, claiming that these portions of Hebrews indicate that a believer may lose his salvation. The believers have eternal life and will never perish. However, the believers need to be warned by the words of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 24:51; 25:30) and Paul (1 Cor. 3:13-15) concerning the coming kingdom age, which will be a reward to the faithful believers and a punishment to the unfaithful ones.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(15)</h1>
<p>In the two preceding messages we have seen that the believers are made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Spirit of God, and by having the eternal life. In this message we shall see that the believers are made a new creation also by being renewed and by being transferred.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. By Being Renewed</h2>
<p>Titus 3:5 speaks of the renewing of the Holy Spirit. Through regeneration the believers have a new birth. The Spirit we have received is eternally new, and the eternal life which we have also is new. As believers in Christ, we have had a new birth, we have received the Spirit, who is always new, and we have a new life. Therefore, we are renewed, and are still being renewed, in order to be made a new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) By the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The believers are renewed by the Holy Spirit. In ourselves we are the old creation both in nature and in appearance. Because we are old inwardly and outwardly, we need the renewing of the Holy Spirit that follows regeneration. The Holy Spirit renews us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature. Day by day, the Holy Spirit is renewing us to make us a new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Related to the Washing of Regeneration</h2>
<p>The renewing of the Holy Spirit is related to the washing of regeneration. The Greek word for &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; in Titus 3:5 refers to a change from one state of things to another. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, remodeling, with the divine life. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts into our being the divine essence of the new man. In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of the new creation. Both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us until the completion of the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) To Be a New Creation</h2>
<p>The renewing that is by the Holy Spirit and related to the washing of regeneration is to make the believers a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). This is God&rsquo;s intention. In the old creation God did not work His life and nature into any of His creatures, not even into man. In the new creation, however, God&rsquo;s life and nature are wrought into man to make divinity one entity with humanity. By being renewed we are transformed by the divine life to be the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) To Be Created into One New Man</h2>
<p>The believers are renewed in order to be created into one new man (Eph. 2:14-16). We have been made a new creation, and in this new creation we are a new man. The new man, which is the church, is corporate and universal. There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe. All the believers are components of this one corporate and universal new man.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:15, referring to the Jews and the Gentiles, tells us that Christ created &ldquo;the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;in Himself&rdquo; is very significant. It indicates that Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man but also the sphere in which and the essence with which the new man has been created. Christ is the element of the new man. After we were terminated through His crucifixion, in Him we received the new essence. Christ Himself became this new element to us. Nothing of our old man was good for the creation of the new man, for our former essence was sinful. But in Christ there is a wonderful essence, in which the one new man has been created.</p>
<p>We all need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we, the believers, have been created into one new man in Christ. Apart from being in Him, we could not have been created into the new man, because in ourselves we do not have the divine essence, which is the element of the new man. Only in the divine essence and with the divine essence were we created into the new man. It is possible to have this essence only in Christ, who Himself is this essence. Hence, in Himself Christ created the two into one new man.</p><h2 class="head5">(a) Through the Cross of Christ</h2>
<p>It is through the death of Christ that the believers have been created into one new man. Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross was not only for the accomplishment of redemption but also for the creation of the one new man. In order to create the new man, it was necessary for Christ to abolish through His cross the ordinances, the different ways of living and worshipping. &ldquo;In His flesh,&rdquo; which was typified by the separating veil in the temple, which was rent (Heb. 10:20), Christ terminated the negative things so that in Himself as the essence the one new man might be created. Therefore, our being created into one new man was through the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(b) By Abolishing the Law<br />
of the Commandments in Ordinances,<br />
Breaking Down the Middle Wall of Partition,<br />
and Slaying the Enmity<br />

to Reconcile the Two in One Body to God</h2>
<p>Through the cross Christ created the one new man by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances, breaking down the middle wall of partition, and slaying the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles to reconcile the two in one Body to God. The law of the commandments in ordinances is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and eating certain foods. By abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances, Christ broke down &ldquo;the middle wall of partition, the enmity&rdquo; (Eph. 2:14). Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption this separation has been removed. The middle wall of partition broken down by Christ is the law of the commandments in ordinances. By abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances Christ broke down this middle wall of partition.</p>
<p>Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles in order to &ldquo;reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross&rdquo; (Eph. 2:16). This one Body, the church (Eph. 1:22-23), is the one new man. It was in this one Body that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled to God through the cross. We, the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ but also in the Body of Christ. Through the cross with the blood of Christ, we have been brought back to God in the one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. By Being Transferred</h2>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Out of Death into Life</h2>
<p>The believers have been made a new creation by being transferred. First, we have been transferred out of death into life. &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life&rdquo; (John 5:24). Death is of the source of the tree of knowledge, and life is of the source of the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9, 17). Hence, to pass out of death into life is to change the source of living.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in John 5:24 brings us back to the fall in the garden of Eden. After man was created, he was put before two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is related to death. Because of the fall, mankind was brought into death. For this reason, everyone born into Adam is born into death. When we repented of our sins and believed in the Lord Jesus, we were saved and regenerated. To be regenerated actually means to receive the tree of life, from which mankind was cut off through Adam&rsquo;s fall. By repenting and believing in the Lord Jesus, spontaneously we received the divine life into us, and at that very moment we passed out of death into life. In this way we were transferred out of death into life.</p>
<p>First John 3:14 says, &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.&rdquo; Death is of the Devil, God&rsquo;s enemy Satan, signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brings death. Life is of God, the source of life, signified by the tree of life, which issues in life. Death and life are not only of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres. To pass out of death is to pass out of the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of death into the source, the essence, the element, and sphere of life. This took place in us at our regeneration. We know this, we have the inner consciousness of this, because we love the brothers. Love toward the brothers is a strong evidence of this. Faith in the Lord Jesus is the way for us to pass out of death into life; love toward the brothers is the evidence that we have passed out of death into life. To have faith is to receive the eternal life; to love is to live by the eternal life and express it.</p><h2 class="head4">(2) Out of Darkness into Light</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we have also been transferred out of darkness into light. Acts 26:18 speaks of being turned from darkness to light, and 1 Peter 2:9, of being called out of darkness into God&rsquo;s marvelous light. Darkness is the expression and sphere of Satan in death. Light is the expression and sphere of God in life. God has transferred us out of Satan&rsquo;s death-realm of darkness into His life-realm of light. Just as Satan and darkness are one, so God and light are one. Light is God Himself (1 John 1:5). When we are in the light, we are in God. Therefore, it is a great matter to be transferred out of darkness into light.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) Out of the Authority of Satan to God</h2>
<p>Acts 26:18 also speaks of being turned from &ldquo;the authority of Satan to God.&rdquo; To be turned from the authority of Satan to God is to be transferred out of the authority of Satan into God.</p>
<p>The authority of Satan is Satan&rsquo;s kingdom (Matt. 12:26), which belongs to darkness. Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31) and the ruler of the power of the air (Eph. 2:2). He has his authority and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12). Hence, Satan has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13). According to Acts 26:18, we have been transferred out of the authority of Satan to God. Actually, to be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God&rsquo;s kingdom belonging to light. Formerly we were in darkness under the authority of Satan, but we have been transferred out of darkness and the authority of Satan into light and God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Out of the Authority of Darkness<br />
into the Kingdom of the Son of His Love</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:13 tells us that the Father has &ldquo;delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.&rdquo; The authority of darkness denotes Satan. God is light, and Satan is darkness. Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness is the authority of evil in the heavenlies, in the air (Eph. 6:12). This evil refers to something that is in rebellion against God. The authority of evil, of rebellion, in the heavenlies is the kingdom of Satan, the authority of darkness (Matt. 12:26).</p>
<p>Darkness is related to death. Where darkness is, there death is also. This darkness is opposed to light, which is related to life. Satan, darkness, and death stand in opposition to God, light, and life.</p>
<p>To be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the Devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14; John 17:15). We have been delivered from the Devil, Satan, by the death of Christ (Col. 2:15) and by the life of Christ in resurrection (John 5:24).</p>
<p>We have been not only delivered out of the authority of darkness but also transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ (Rev. 11:15; 12:10).</p>
<p>The Son of the Father is the expression of the Father as the source of life (John 1:18, 4; 1 John 1:2). The Father as the source of life is expressed in the Son. The Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love to be the embodiment of life to us in the divine love with the authority in resurrection. The Son, as the embodiment of the divine life, is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love. The divine life embodied in the Son is given to us in the divine love. Therefore, the object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection. This is the kingdom of the Son of His love.</p>
<p>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us (1 John 5:12). The Son in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 6:4-5) is now the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He rules us in His resurrection life with love. This is the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love. When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>We have been transferred into a realm where we are ruled in love with life. Here, under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light. This is what it means to be delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love. Here in this kingdom we enjoy Christ and have the church life.</p><h2 class="head4">(5) Out of Adam into Christ</h2>
<p>The believers have also been transferred out of Adam into Christ (1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:12, 17, 19). In the sight of God, there are only two men in the universe: Adam and Christ. All men are in one of these two persons; that is, all are either in Adam or in Christ. Everything depends on where we are. If we are in Adam, we are a part of Adam. If we are in Christ, we are a part of Christ. Before we were saved, we were in Adam. But in God&rsquo;s salvation we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ.</p>
<p>Adam was the first man (1 Cor. 15:47). He was not only the first man but also the first Adam (1 Cor. 15:45a). Adam was created by God (Gen. 1:27), and he had nothing of the nature and life of God. He was merely God&rsquo;s creation, a work of His hand.</p>
<p>Christ is the second Man (1 Cor. 15:47) and the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b). To say that Christ is the second Man and the last Adam means that Christ is the last man. After Him there is no third man, for the second is the last. This second Man was not created by God. He is a man mingled with God; He is God incarnated to be a man. Although the first man did not have the divine nature and the divine life, the second Man is the mingling of God with His creature and thus is full of the divine life and nature.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:22 says, &ldquo;For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.&rdquo; In Adam we were born in death and were born to die; we were dead in him (Eph. 2:1, 5). In Christ we have been reborn in life and resurrected to live; we have been enlivened, made alive, in Him (Eph. 2:5-6). Whereas the result of Adam&rsquo;s transgression is death, the result of Christ&rsquo;s obedience is life (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>In Adam there are three main things: sin, death, and being constituted sinners (Rom. 5:19). In Adam we inherited sin, we were under the reign of death (Rom. 5:12, 14), and we were constituted sinners. Of course, in Adam we were also under God&rsquo;s condemnation.</p>
<p>We praise the Lord that we are no longer in Adam but in Christ. As a result of being in Christ, we have grace with righteousness (Rom. 5:17). In Adam we had sin; in Christ we have grace with righteousness. What we have is not righteousness alone or grace alone but grace with righteousness. Grace and righteousness work together because grace works through righteousness. Furthermore, in Christ we have eternal life instead of death. We can even reign in this eternal life (Rom. 5:17). Although death once reigned over us (Rom. 5:14), now we can reign in life. Moreover, in Christ we are not under God&rsquo;s condemnation. Instead, we are under His justification. In Christ we have all been justified.</p>
<p>We were transferred out of Adam into Christ by believing into Christ (John 3:15) and by being baptized into Him (Rom. 6:3). When we believed in Christ, we actually believed ourselves into Him. Likewise, being baptized into water is a sign indicating that we have been baptized into Christ. God has put us into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), and we must believe this fact. We should testify boldly that we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. We are no longer in Adam&mdash;we are in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) From Law to Grace</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ have also been transferred from law to grace. In Romans 6:14 Paul says, &ldquo;You are not under law but under grace.&rdquo; Although the law continues to exist, we are not under it any longer. Once we were under law, but now we are under grace. This grace is nothing less than the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be everything to us for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>John 1:17 says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The law makes demands upon man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet God&rsquo;s demands. No one can partake of God through the law, but grace is the enjoyment of God for man. Actually, grace is what God is to us for our enjoyment. Grace is God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience. Grace is not mainly the work God does for us; grace is the Triune God dispensed into us and experienced by us as our enjoyment. In brief, the grace to which we have been transferred is the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us.</p>
<p>John 1:17 tells us that grace came through Jesus Christ. This indicates that grace is somewhat like a person. Here grace is personified, and the personification of grace is God Himself. Paul realized this when he said, &ldquo;Not I, but the grace of God with me&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:10). For Paul, grace was a living person, God Himself in Christ with all He is for the believers&rsquo; enjoyment. As believers in Christ, we have been transferred from law to such a marvelous grace.</p><h2 class="head4">(7) Out of the Evil Age,<br />
the Crooked Generation, That Is, the Religious World,<br />
the Judaic Religion, the Religious Fold,<br />
into Christ and the Church</h2>
<p>Finally, the believers have been transferred out of the evil age, the crooked generation, that is, the religious world, the Judaic religion, the religious fold, into Christ and the church. Galatians 1:4 says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age. According to the context of the book of Galatians, the present evil age in 1:4 refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, which at Paul&rsquo;s time was the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by Galatians 6:14 and 15, where circumcision is considered part of the world&mdash;the religious world to which Paul was crucified. In 1:4 Paul emphasizes that the purpose of Christ&rsquo;s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us out, from the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law (Gal. 3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3), according to the will of God.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil religious age indicates that He died in order to rescue us from Judaism. In John 10 we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture. The fold in John 10 signifies the law, or Judaism as a religion of the law, in which God&rsquo;s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody until Christ came. Eventually, Christ came as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of the fold to the pasture, where they may feed on His riches. Therefore, Christ died on the cross not only for the sins of His sheep but also to bring them out of the fold.</p>
<p>In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.&rdquo; The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ (Eph. 2:14-16; 3:6), brought forth by life, which the Lord Jesus imparted into His members through His death (John 10:10-18). The fold is Judaism, and the flock is the church.</p>
<p>Christ has brought us out of the fold into the flock. Today, in the sight of God, the various denominations, sects, and independent groups are folds. A well-known hymn speaks of &ldquo;the grace that brought me to the fold.&rdquo; This is not accurate. Christ has not brought us to the fold;</p>
<p>He has brought us out of the fold and into the flock, the church. Whereas the fold is a place, the flock is a living entity composed of all the living members of Christ. All those who believe in Christ are His sheep in His one flock under Him as the one Shepherd. The transfer that has been accomplished concerning us includes the matter of being transferred out of the religious fold into the one flock.</p>
<p>In Acts 2:40 Peter testified and entreated, saying, &ldquo;Be saved from this crooked generation!&rdquo; This crooked generation refers to the perverted Jews in this age who rejected God&rsquo;s Christ (Acts 2:36) and were considered by God as the present evil age. For the crooked Jews to be saved from their present evil age requires a genuine repentance of their crookedness toward God and a real turn to God. This indicates that they need to turn to God not only from their sins but also from their generation, their Jewish society, including their Jewish religion. The result of such a salvation is an entrance into a new generation&mdash;the church. Thus, the saved ones will be separated from Jewish society unto the church. To be saved this way implies to be saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation and eternal perdition unto God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and His pleasure (Eph. 3:11; 1:9).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(16)</h1>
<p>We have seen that the believers are made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Spirit, by having eternal life, by being renewed, and by being transferred. In this message we shall see that, as the last matter concerning the believers being made a new creation, we are made a new creation by being freed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">f. By Being Freed&mdash;Released</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s redemption the believers are freed from God&rsquo;s judgment, out of the curse of the law, from God&rsquo;s wrath, and from the fear and slavery of death. This freedom is objective and positional. In order to become a new creation, the believers also need to be freed subjectively and dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) From Sins</h2>
<p>First, we are freed from sins. Matthew 1:21 says, &ldquo;She will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.&rdquo; Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah the Savior, or, the salvation of Jehovah. On the cross the Lord Jesus bore our sins, shed His blood for us, and suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. In this way He solved the problem of our sins. Then He was resurrected, becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the Spirit He entered into us to become our living Savior so that we may be set free from sins. Therefore, by His death and resurrection and by His coming into us as the Spirit, He is able to save us out of our sins.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:24 tells us that Christ &ldquo;Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;having died to sins&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;being away from sins.&rdquo; As fallen human beings, we were full of sins. But Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for our sins so that we may be released from them.</p>
<p>We should not only have the objective cross but also the subjective cross as well. The objective cross needs to become subjective to us in our experience. This depends on the working of the life-giving Spirit within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s cross in our being. Christ&rsquo;s death has drawn a separating line between us and sins. Now when we call on the name of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the life-giving Spirit operates within us. Spontaneously we experience the subjective working of the cross to make a separation between us and sins. Then, in a practical way in our experience, we are freed, released, from sins.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) From the Power of Sin</h2>
<p>In addition to being freed from sins, the believers are released from the power of sin. In John 8:34 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.&rdquo; A slave is always under a certain bondage. Satan, the Devil, has brought all humankind under the bondage of sin by imparting himself into man as the sinful nature that compels man to sin. It is impossible for anyone to free himself from such a slavery.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is qualified to forgive our sins and able to set us free from slavery under the power of sin. Satan&rsquo;s subtlety was not only to cause us to do something wrong but, to inject himself into us. Thus, sin is not merely outward, objective wrongdoing. Sin is subjective; it is in the nature of our being. Our slavery is not an outward thing; it is inward, in our nature. For this reason, nothing outside our nature can help us in dealing with the sin that is in our nature. We need another life, a stronger, richer, higher life, to set us free from this slavery. Only the Lord can be such a life, and He truly is such a life because He is the divine life (John 11:25; 14:6). Having become the life-giving Spirit, He is able to come into us to be our life to encounter the sinful nature within us and to release us from the power of sin.</p>
<p>John 8:32 and 36 reveal that we are freed from the power of sin by the Son as reality. This reality is not the so-called truth of doctrine; it is the reality of the truth which is the Lord Himself (John 14:6; 1:14, 17). In John 8:32 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The reality shall set you free,&rdquo; and in verse 36 He says, &ldquo;The Son shall set you free.&rdquo; This indicates that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the reality. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), He is the reality of what God is. Hence, reality is the divine element, the element of God, realized by us. When the Lord as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light. (John 8:12), which brings the divine element as reality into us. This reality, which is the divine element imparted into us and realized by us, sets us free from the bondage of sin by the divine life as the light of man.</p>
<p>Romans 6 reveals that the believers have been freed from the power of sin. &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves; for he who has died is justified from sin&rdquo; (vv. 6-7). &ldquo;Sin shall not lord it over you, for you are not under law but under grace&rdquo; (v. 14). &ldquo;Having been freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness&rdquo; (v. 18). &ldquo;Now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life&rdquo; (v. 22). We need to see that we have been released from sin. Based on our seeing, we reckon ourselves as such by believing. Then we need to cooperate with the divine life by rejecting sin and by presenting ourselves and our members to God. We have a position to reject sin, for we are &ldquo;not under law but under grace.&rdquo; Sin has no ground, no right, to make claims on us. Instead, we, standing under grace, have the full right to reject sin and its power. Furthermore, by taking sides with Christ, we present ourselves and our members as slaves to Christ so that the divine life may work within us to sanctify us.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) From Law</h2>
<p>Galatians 4 reveals that the believers have been freed from law. Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s chosen people were shut up by law under its custody (Gal. 3:23). Christ was born under law in order to redeem them from its custody that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God. Hence, they should not return to the custody of law to be under its slavery, but should remain in the sonship of God to enjoy the life supply of the Spirit in Christ.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the New Testament, God&rsquo;s economy is to produce sons. Christ&rsquo;s redemption brings us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life. It is not God&rsquo;s economy to make us keepers of law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God&rsquo;s economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. His eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression (Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship (Eph. 1:5) and regenerated us to be His sons (John 1:12-13). Now we should remain in His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not be distracted by the appreciation of law.</p>
<p>In Romans 6:14 Paul tells us, &ldquo;You are not under law but under grace.&rdquo; Then in 7:1-6 he goes on to explain how we are not under law. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; Because the law was given to the old man (Rom. 6:6), who is the old husband, (7:2-3) and because the old man died on the cross, we are discharged from his law. This is why we are no longer under the law.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) From the Bondage of Law</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we are free not only from law but also from the bondage of law. This is clearly revealed in the book of Galatians. Galatians 5:1 says, &ldquo;For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore and do not be again entangled with a yoke of slavery.&rdquo; This charge is based on the revelation presented in chapters one through four, where Paul speaks of slavery under the law and of how Christ has delivered us from that slavery. The freedom in 5:1 denotes freedom from the slavery of law. Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace. To stand fast is to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of law. Because Christ has set us free for freedom, we should stand fast and not be entangled again with the yoke of slavery.</p>
<p>In Galatians 4:7 Paul says, &ldquo;You are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.&rdquo; The New Testament believer is no longer a slave to works under law, but is a son in life under grace. Instead of the law to keep us in custody, we have the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is everything to us. Whereas the law could not give life, the Spirit gives life and brings us into maturity that we may have the full position and right of sons. The custody of the law has been replaced by the Spirit of sonship.</p>
<p>Galatians 5:13 says, &ldquo;You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not turn the freedom into an occasion for the flesh, but through love serve one another as slaves.&rdquo; Here we see Paul&rsquo;s balance in the matter of freedom. On the one hand, we are free from the yoke of slavery, from the law; on the other hand, we should not use this freedom for an occasion for the flesh, but should care for others and serve them in love.</p>
<p>In Galatians 2:4 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.&rdquo; Such strong negative terms as &ldquo;false brothers,&rdquo; &ldquo;stole in,&rdquo; and &ldquo;spy out&rdquo; should impress us with the fact that freedom in Christ is a great and precious matter.</p>
<p>Freedom in Christ has at least four aspects. First, freedom in Christ implies liberation from obligation. Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations. Second, freedom in Christ includes satisfaction with a rich supply. If we are free outwardly but do not have anything to support us or satisfy us, this freedom is not genuine. Real freedom is not only liberation from obligation but also full satisfaction with an abundant supply. Third, to be free in Christ is to enjoy rest. Fourth, freedom in Christ implies the enjoyment of Christ. Because we are free in Him, we enjoy all that He is. Therefore, freedom in Christ involves liberation from obligation, satisfaction through the Lord&rsquo;s rich supply, genuine rest, and the enjoyment of Christ. Because those who have this kind of freedom are free in the depths of their being, they are released from the bondage of law.</p><h2 class="head4">(5) From the Labor and Burden<br />
under the Law and Religion<br />
or under Any Work and Responsibility</h2>
<p>The believers are also freed from the labor and burden under the law and religion or under any work and responsibility. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus sounded out a call: &ldquo;Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; This promise was spoken especially to those who were trying to keep the law. It refers in particular to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations. To have rest here means to be set free from labor and burden under law and religion. All who are burdened under the law should come to the Lord Jesus, and He will release them. Under the law, we have no rest. True rest is found in Christ.</p>
<p>The labor mentioned in Matthew 11:28 refers not only to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations, but also refers to the labor of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever labors thus is always heavily burdened. Therefore, the Lord calls this kind of people to come to Him for rest. This rest refers not only to being set free from labor and burden under the law and religion or under any work and responsibility but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction. If we are burdened under law and religion or under any work and responsibility, we should come to the Savior, who will transfer us out of our burden into His glorious freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) From the Flesh</h2>
<p>In order to be made a new creation, we have also been freed from our flesh, which is most troublesome. In Colossians 2:11 Paul tells us that in Christ &ldquo;you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; Here Paul speaks of a circumcision not made with hands. This circumcision is the circumcision in Christ, a spiritual circumcision. The circumcision in Christ involves the death of Christ and the power of the Spirit. When Christ was crucified, His crucifixion was the genuine, practical, and universal circumcision. His crucifixion cut off all negative things, including our flesh. However, along with the death of Christ, we need the Spirit as the power. The crucifixion of Christ becomes practical and effective by means of the Spirit. By the Spirit as the power Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion is applied to us and its effect is executed upon us. Then under the power of the Spirit we are circumcised in an actual and practical way.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;putting off&rdquo; in Colossians 2:11 mean to strip off something, as to strip off clothing. The circumcision that took place by the death of Christ and is applied by the powerful Spirit accomplishes the putting off of the body of the flesh. Our body of flesh was crucified with Christ and has been put off. Regarding this, we must exercise our faith and not consider the apparent situation. By faith we declare that we have been freed from the flesh, for the body of the flesh has been put off on the cross and by the powerful Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(7) From the Old Man</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:9 Paul speaks of the believers &ldquo;having put off the old man with his practices.&rdquo; The old man is of Adam, created by God but fallen through sin. To put off the old man is like putting off an old garment: first, putting to death the physical lusts (Col. 3:5), then putting away the psychological evils (v. 8), and finally putting off the entire old man with his practices. Colossians 3:9 indicates that the totality of the old man, the entire being of the old man, is to be put off as if we were putting off an old garment. The total person of the old man must be put away. In this verse Paul speaks of our having put off the old man because we put off the old man in baptism. Our old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6) and was buried in baptism (Rom. 6:4).</p>
<h2 class="head4">(8) From Satan&rsquo;s Oppression</h2>
<p>The New Testament indicates that the Lord Jesus has released the believers from Satan&rsquo;s oppression. In Luke 4:18 He says that He was anointed &ldquo;to send away in release those who are oppressed.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; comes from a verb meaning to break in pieces (Matt. 12:20). &ldquo;Those who are oppressed&rdquo; are those oppressed under Satan in sickness or in sin.</p>
<p>Consider the case of the healing and releasing of a bent-double and Satan-bound woman (Luke 13:10-17). This woman &ldquo;had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bent double and utterly unable to stand erect&rdquo; (v. 11). Literally, the Greek words rendered &ldquo;bent double&rdquo; mean &ldquo;bending together.&rdquo; This may signify the demon&rsquo;s oppression over a person to an extreme extent, so that the person is bent toward the satanic world only and is unable to stand erect to look into the heavens. The Lord Jesus saw the woman who was bent double, utterly unable to stand erect, but forced to look down to the earth as a result of the oppression exercised upon her by Satan. The Lord said to her, &ldquo;Woman, you have been released from your infirmity; and He laid His hands on her, and instantly she was made erect, and glorified God&rdquo; (vv. 12-13). When the Lord Jesus healed this woman, He released her from Satan&rsquo;s oppression. This case, therefore, is a fulfillment of the proclamation made by the Lord Jesus in Luke 4:18.</p>
<p>Another verse which indicates that the believers have been freed from Satan&rsquo;s oppression is Acts 10:38. This verse tells us that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; refer to miracles, especially healings, which the Lord did to release people from their sufferings of diseases and the possession of demons. This work, carried out in Christ&rsquo;s humanity with the divine power, released people from the oppression of the Devil. As believers in Christ, we have been freed from Satan&rsquo;s oppression.</p><h2 class="head4">(9) From the Religious World<br />
and Its Elements&mdash;Ordinances</h2>
<p>In the books of Galatians and Colossians we see that the believers have been freed from the religious world and its elements. Galatians 1:4 says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins, that He might, rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; In this verse the present evil age refers to the religious world. Galatians 6:14 and 15 confirm this: &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.&rdquo; The world in verse 14 refers mainly to the religious world. &ldquo;For&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 15 indicates that this verse is an explanation of the foregoing verse. Circumcision, being a religious matter, indicates that the world in verse 14 must be mainly the religious world from which the believers in Christ have been released.</p>
<p>By the cross we are separated from the religious world. If we are still involved with the religious world, we shall not be able to live a new creation. We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world. We should be able to testify that even if we tried to go back to that world, we would be rejected by it, for we have been crucified to it. If Paul had desired to return to Judaism, the religionists would not have accepted him. Rather, they would have commanded him to leave, for he was in another realm. To Judaism Paul had been crucified, and Judaism had been crucified to him. Between him and the religious world there was the separation of the cross. It is this separation which qualifies us to live a new creation. Everything practiced in the religious world is part of the old creation. But through the cross of Christ we are finished with religion and are in another world, another realm. In this realm we live a new creation by the Spirit, not the old creation by the flesh.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:20 indicates that as those who &ldquo;died with Christ from the elements of the world&rdquo; we should no longer subject ourselves to ordinances. The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society. With Christ we have died to these elements of the world. When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also. In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(10) From Their Vain Manner of Life<br />
Handed Down from Their Fathers</h2>
<p>Finally, the believers have been freed from their vain manner of life handed down from their fathers. First Peter 1:18 reminds us that we have been redeemed from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. A vain manner of life is not necessarily sinful. On the contrary, in certain respects it may be quite moral. Nevertheless, it is still vain&mdash;having no goal, no aim, no purpose. Anything without goal or purpose is vanity. The believers should live a life without vanity. Everything we do and say should have God&rsquo;s goal in view. This kind of life is weighty and full of content; it is a life with purpose, goal, and aim.</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 1:18 and 19, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from our vain manner of life. This vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life (v. 15). Christ&rsquo;s redemption and the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification (v. 2) are for this&mdash; to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we should be encouraged to live a holy life, a life to express God in His holiness.</p>
<p>We have seen that the believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Spirit of God, by having the eternal life, by being renewed, by being transferred, and by being released. These six matters constitute the making of the new creation.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(17)</h1>
<p>We have seen that in the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of regeneration, the believers have been called by God, have been sanctified by the Spirit, have repented and believed, have been baptized and joined to the processed Triune God, have been redeemed, and made a new creation. Now we need to see that, as believers in Christ, we have been saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. Saved</h2>
<p>Mark 16:16a; Acts 16:31; and Romans 10:9 and 13 reveal clearly that the believers have been saved. In Mark 16:16a the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; To believe is to receive Christ for forgiveness of sins and regeneration that we may become children of God. To be baptized is to affirm this. Hence, to believe and to be baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Acts 16:19-34 speaks of the salvation of the Philippian jailer and his household. The jailer asked Paul and Silas, &ldquo;What must I do that I may be saved?&rdquo; (v. 30). They said, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo; (v. 31). The word &ldquo;household&rdquo; here indicates that the family of the believer is a complete unit for God&rsquo;s salvation. Paul and Silas &ldquo;spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house...and he was baptized immediately, he and all his household. And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted, having believed in God with all his household&rdquo; (vv. 32-34). The jailer, after believing and being baptized, came into fellowship with the apostles, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, as a token of his salvation.</p>
<p>Romans 10:9 says, &ldquo;If you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo; Here we see that being saved involves the inward matter of believing in our heart and the outward matter of confessing with our mouth. Inwardly, in our heart, we need to believe that Jesus Christ was raised up from among the dead by God. Outwardly, with our mouth, we need to confess audibly and openly the Lord Jesus. By this believing and confessing we are saved.</p>
<p>Romans 10:13 says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;call&rdquo; means to invoke a person, to call a person by name. Hence, calling on the Lord requires that we call out to Him or address Him audibly. In order to be saved we need to call upon the name of the Lord. By calling on His name, we participate in and enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. By God in His Trinity</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:1 speaks of God our Savior, for in His salvation He is not a law-giving God but the saving God. In Titus 3:4 and 5 Paul says that &ldquo;the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared&rdquo; and that &ldquo;according to His mercy, He saved us.&rdquo; It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.</p>
<p>The believers have been saved by God in His trinity. In saving us God surely is the Triune God. The Father planned, the Son accomplished the Father&rsquo;s plan, and the Spirit applies what the Son has accomplished according to the Father&rsquo;s plan. Therefore, the Trinity has been exercised to save us.</p>
<p>The operation of the divine Trinity in the salvation of sinners is revealed in the three parables in Luke 15. These parables unveil and depict how the divine Trinity works to bring sinners back through the Son by the Spirit to the Father. Clearly, the shepherd refers to the Son, the woman refers to the Spirit, and the father refers to the heavenly Father. The Son came in His humanity as the Shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring it back home (vv. 4-7). The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman seeks carefully one lost coin until she finds it (vv. 8-10). The Father receives the repenting and returned sinner as a certain man receives his prodigal son (vv. 11-32). The entire divine Trinity treasures the sinner and participates in bringing him back to God. All three parables emphasize the love of the divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner. The divine love is fully expressed in the Son&rsquo;s tender care as the good Shepherd, in the Spirit&rsquo;s fine seeking as the treasure lover, and in the Father&rsquo;s warm receiving as a loving father.</p>
<p>The sequence of the Trinity in Luke 15 is different from that in Matthew 28:19. In Matthew 28:19 the sequence is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in Luke we first have the Son as the shepherd, then the Spirit as the woman, and finally the Father as the father receiving his returned son. Therefore, in Luke 15 the sequence begins with the Son, goes to the Spirit, and leads to the Father. This sequence is exactly the same as that in Ephesians 2:18: &ldquo;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; According to this verse, our access first is in the Son and then through the Spirit. Through the Son and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father. This is our access into the Triune God, access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father. Truly, as believers in Christ, we have been saved by God in His trinity.</p><h2 class="head4">(1) Of God the Father</h2>
<p>It is of God the Father that we have been saved (2 Thes. 2:13). To say that salvation is of God the Father means that the Father is the origin of our salvation. The Father originated our salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) In God the Son</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we are saved in God the Son. The Son is the element, the sphere, and the means in which we are saved. First John 4:14 tells us, &ldquo;We have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is the Savior of fallen mankind. His being the Savior is based on His person and redemptive work. He is the very God becoming a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full redemption for us, through which He has saved us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from our fallen condition. Therefore, in 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul testifies, &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&rdquo; Christ came into the world by incarnation (John 1:14) to be our Savior. He was incarnated in order to save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. Hence, the believers are saved in God the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) Through God the Spirit</h2>
<p>The believers are saved through God the Spirit (Titus 3:5). The Spirit is the Triune God reaching us and applied to us. Thus, we are saved through the Spirit&rsquo;s application. Our salvation is of the Father, in the Son, and through the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Through All the Constituents<br />
of God&rsquo;s Eternal Salvation</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is an eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9), and this salvation is not simple but has many constituents. These constituents include God&rsquo;s calling, the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification, and the believers&rsquo; being joined to the processed Triune God, redeemed, and made a new creation. With each of these items there are many details. God&rsquo;s calling is according to His predestination and purpose, through His own glory and virtue, in Christ, and through the gospel. This heavenly calling is a calling out of darkness into God&rsquo;s marvelous light and into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. It is a calling to the suffering of Christ, to the peace of Christ for His one Body, unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, into His eternal glory for the expression of the God of all grace, into God&rsquo;s own kingdom and glory, and for the believers to be separated and made holy unto God. In order to sanctify us, separate us unto God, the Spirit sought us by enlightening us and convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. As those who have been joined to the processed Triune God, the believers have been joined to God the Father as the source of the divine Trinity, to God the Son as the embodiment of the processed Triune God, and to God the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. The believers have been redeemed by being bought, forgiven of their sins, freed, washed positionally and dispositionally, sanctified, justified objectively and subjectively, and reconciled to God in the first step. Moreover, the believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Spirit of God, by having eternal life, by being renewed, by being transferred, and by being freed. From this we see that, far from being superficial, God&rsquo;s salvation is rich in its constituents.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. From:</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal salvation saves us from many things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) God&rsquo;s Condemnation and Eternal Perdition</h2>
<p>First, the believers are saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation and eternal perdition. John 3:18 says, &ldquo;He who believes in Him is not judged [condemned]; he who does not believe has been judged [condemned] already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&rdquo; In John 5:24 the Lord Jesus tells us, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment [condemnation], but has passed out of death into life.&rdquo; As sinners, we were under God&rsquo;s condemnation and His sentence of eternal perdition. But we have been saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from eternal perdition.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) God&rsquo;s Wrath</h2>
<p>The believers are also saved from God&rsquo;s wrath. &ldquo;Having now been justified in His blood, we shall be saved through Him from the wrath&rdquo; (Rom. 5:9). In John 3:36 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.&rdquo; Furthermore, 1 Thessalonians 1:10 speaks of &ldquo;Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.&rdquo; This is the wrath of the coming judgment of God. Before we were saved, we were under God&rsquo;s wrath. But as believers in Christ, we are saved from the wrath of God.</p><h2 class="head4">(3) The Law, the Curse of the Law,<br />
the Bondage of the Law,<br />
and the Labor and Burden under the Law</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the believers are saved from the law, the curse of the law, the bondage of the law, and the labor and burden under the law. Galatians 4:4 and 5 indicate that God sent forth His Son to redeem us from under law, and Romans 6:14 tells us that we are no longer under the law. This is to be saved from the law. Galatians 3:13 declares, &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf.&rdquo; As our Substitute on the cross, Christ not only bore the curse for us but also became a curse for us. Therefore, we are saved from the curse of the law. Furthermore, the book of Galatians emphasizes the fact that we are saved from the bondage of the law (Gal. 5:1; 4:7; 5:13; 2:4). Furthermore, we are saved from the labor and burden under the law. This is clearly indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 11:28: &ldquo;Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">(4) Sins and the Power of Sin</h2>
<p>The believers are saved from sins and from the power of sin. Christ has saved us from our sins (Matt. 1:21), having &ldquo;carried up our sins in His body onto the tree&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24) and dying for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3). Also, by being the reality, Christ has set us free from the power of sin (John 8:34, 36, 32). Therefore, we have the forgiveness of sins through Him (Acts 10:43) and deliverance from the power of sin (Rom. 6:6, 7, 18).</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) The Flesh, the Old Man, and Adam</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation we are saved from the flesh, the old man, and Adam. Colossians 2:11 tells us that in Christ we were &ldquo;circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that through the crucifixion of Christ, which was a universal circumcision, we have been saved from the flesh. In Romans 6:6 Paul says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him,&rdquo; and in Colossians 3:9 he says that we have &ldquo;put off the old man with his practices.&rdquo; We have been saved from the old man, who was created by God but who became fallen through sin. Moreover, we have been saved from Adam by being transferred out of Adam into Christ (1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:12, 17, 19). In Adam we had sin and death, but in Christ we have righteousness and life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) The Fear and Slavery of Death,<br />
Satan, the Oppression of Satan,<br />
the Authority of Satan, and Darkness</h2>
<p>As believers, we are saved from the fear and slavery of death, Satan, the oppression of Satan, the authority of Satan, and darkness. Hebrews 2:14 and 15 say, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil; and might release those who through fear of death through all their life were held in slavery.&rdquo; Because Christ has destroyed the Devil who has the might of death, He has saved us from the fear and slavery of death. The Lord Jesus has also saved us from Satan and from Satan&rsquo;s oppression and authority. We have been turned from the authority of Satan to God (Acts 26:18). We have also been turned from darkness to light, having been transferred out of Satan&rsquo;s death-realm of darkness into God&rsquo;s life-realm of light.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(7) The Religious World and Its Elements</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1:4 we see that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; According to the context of the book of Galatians and as confirmed by Galatians 6:14-15, the present evil age refers to the religious world. Galatians 1:4 emphasizes the fact that the purpose of Christ&rsquo;s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us out, of the present evil religious age. Because we have been saved from the religious world, we are no longer in &ldquo;slavery under the elements of the world&rdquo; (Gal. 4:3), elementary principles that refer to the rudimentary teachings of the law. We have been saved from the religious world and its elements.</p><h2 class="head4">(8) The Vain Manner of Life<br />
Handed Down from Their Fathers</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:18 and 19 say, &ldquo;Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the believers have been saved from the vain manner of life handed down from their fathers. The believers have been saved from a life that is vain, a life that has no purpose. As those who have been saved from the vain manner of life handed down to us, we now have a life full of purpose, a life with God&rsquo;s goal in view.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. With Assurance:</h2>
<p>Now we come to a matter that is both crucial and most pleasant, and this is the fact that the believers have been saved with assurance. We have not been saved with ambiguity or uncertainty. On the contrary, we may have the assurance that we are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) By the Word of God</h2>
<p>First, our salvation is assured by the Word of God. God&rsquo;s faithfulness guarantees His Word. First John 5:13 says, &ldquo;I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.&rdquo; Here we see that the written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers that they have eternal life and are saved. Our believing in Christ to be saved and to receive eternal life is a fact; the words of the Scriptures are the assurance concerning this fact. They are the title deed of our eternal salvation. We have salvation, and we also have the Word of God as the title deed to assure us concerning this.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) By the Spirit Witnessing with Their Spirit</h2>
<p>We also are assured of our salvation by the Spirit witnessing with our spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; The indwelling Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are God&rsquo;s children. This witnessing of the Holy Spirit began at the time of our spiritual birth. The fact that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit means that the Spirit of God and our spirit witness together. The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him that we are children of God. Therefore, the Holy Word outside of us and the Holy Spirit indwelling us assure us of our eternal salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) By Loving the Brothers</h2>
<p>A further assurance of our salvation is loving the brothers. First John 3:14 says, &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.&rdquo; In our natural life we are not able to love certain kinds of people. But in the divine life we are able to love all the brothers, all the believers in Christ, no matter what their race or nationality may be. This love of the brothers is an assurance that we have been saved. Because the essence of God is love, the life of God has the nature of love. Love is the essence of God&rsquo;s nature. When we have Him as our divine life, we have the nature of this life, which is love. Therefore, as saved and regenerated ones, we love all the children of God. The Word of God, the Spirit witnessing with our spirit, and our love for the brothers are the full assurance and guarantee that we have been saved.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(18)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that the believers are saved by God in His trinity and that they are saved with assurance. Now we shall go on to see the security of our salvation, and then we shall cover the matter of clearing the past.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. With Security (of Being Saved Once Forever)</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ have been saved with security, the security of being saved once forever. God&rsquo;s salvation is eternal. Once we have received this salvation, it is secured eternally. This is proved by twelve things:</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) By the Invariable God</h2>
<p>Our salvation is secured by the invariable God Himself. James 1:17 says, &ldquo;All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variableness or shadow cast by turning.&rdquo; Here giving refers to the act of giving, and the gift, to the thing given. The lights in this verse denote the heavenly luminaries. The Father is the Creator, the source, of these shining bodies. With Him there is no shadow cast by turning, as there is with the heavenly orbs in the moon turning its dark side to us or in the sun being eclipsed by the moon, for He is not variable, not changeable. God, the unchangeable One (Mal. 3:6), has saved us, and our condition and situation cannot affect His nature or change what He has done for us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) By God&rsquo;s Unchanging Will</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is secured by the unchanging will of God. Ephesians 1:5 tells us that we were predestinated according to God&rsquo;s will. In John 6:39 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I shall lose nothing, but shall raise it up in the last day.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word indicates that the Father&rsquo;s will is that none of those whom He has given the Son should be lost. This is the will of God concerning our salvation. God&rsquo;s will is more steady and stable than a rock. Although heaven and earth may be removed, God&rsquo;s will, which is unchanging, remains forever.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(3) By God&rsquo;s Inseparable Love</h2>
<p>The salvation we have received of God is also secured by God&rsquo;s inseparable love. First John 4:10 says, &ldquo;In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;this&rdquo; refers to the following fact: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins. In this fact is the higher and nobler love of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:35-39 reveals that God&rsquo;s love is inseparable. Nothing is able to separate us from the love of God. Verses 38 and 39 say, &ldquo;I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; We are God&rsquo;s beloved ones, and nothing can separate us from His love. Once God loves us, He loves us forever with an eternal, inseparable love. Therefore, God&rsquo;s salvation is secured by His love. This means that our eternal security is the love of God. We may be assured that nothing will separate us from the love of God, because this love does not derive from us or depend on us but is derived from God and depends on Him. This love was initiated by God in eternity.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:39 Paul points out that the inseparable love of God is in Christ Jesus our Lord. If the love of God were shown apart from Christ, there would be problems, for apart from Christ, even a sin such as losing our temper would separate us from the love of God. However, the love of God is not merely the love of God itself but the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Because the love of God is in Christ Jesus, we may be assured that nothing can separate us from it. Hence, God&rsquo;s inseparable love is a vital factor in the security of our salvation.</p><h2 class="head4">(4) By God&rsquo;s Irrevocable Calling</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is secured by His irrevocable calling, which is based on His selection. God selected us, chose us, before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). It was not we who selected Him but He who selected us (John 15:16). His selection is not of our works but of Himself. God has called us not according to our works but according to His own purpose (2 Tim. 1:9). This calling is irrevocable. &ldquo;The free gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable&rdquo; (Rom. 11:29). God will never repent of it nor regret having called us. His calling has nothing to do with our works; our works cannot affect God&rsquo;s calling, for it is irrevocable. Hence, God&rsquo;s calling, being initiated by God, not by us, is the security of our salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(5) By God&rsquo;s Unchallengeable Justification</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is secured by His unchallengeable justification. Justification is God&rsquo;s action in approving the believers according to the standard of His righteousness. The righteousness of God is revealed to faith (Rom. 1:16-17). For the showing forth of His righteousness, God must justify us, and He has justified us who believe in the Lord Jesus (Rom. 3:26). It is the righteous God who has justified us (Rom. 8:33). His righteousness is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14). God&rsquo;s throne is established forever and nothing can shake it. Our salvation, being secured by God&rsquo;s righteousness and His unchallengeable justification, is as unshakable as God&rsquo;s throne.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(6) By God&rsquo;s Almighty Hand</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; salvation is also secured by God&rsquo;s almighty hand. In John 10:29, the Lord Jesus, referring to His sheep, says, &ldquo;My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; God the Father is more powerful than anything. He has a mighty arm, and strong is His hand (Psa. 89:13). No one can pluck us out of His hand.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(7) By God&rsquo;s Eternal Life</h2>
<p>Our salvation is secured by God&rsquo;s eternal life, by the life of God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever&rdquo; (John 10:28). The divine life which we have received is eternal, and something eternal cannot be changed. Therefore, the fact that the divine life is eternal is a vital element in the security of our salvation.</p>
<p>To say that once we are saved we can be lost again means that the eternal life which has been given to us would be called back. But eternal life will not be recalled once it has been given to us. God&rsquo;s eternal life is the security of our salvation. As long as we have eternal life, we have eternal security, and we shall never perish.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(8) By God&rsquo;s Unbreakable Covenant</h2>
<p>Our salvation is secured by the unbreakable covenant of God. God has saved us by His new covenant (Heb. 8:8-13). It has definitely been covenanted that He has written the law of life within us and that He will never remember our sins. As the faithful God, He will never break His covenant (Psa. 89:34). God is bound not only by His righteousness but also by His faithfulness. Hence, His unbreakable covenant with His faithfulness is a security of our eternal salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(9) By Christ&rsquo;s Perfect and Complete Redemption</h2>
<p>Another matter that secures our salvation is Christ&rsquo;s perfect and complete redemption. Our condition may change, but Christ&rsquo;s redemption, being perfect and complete, cannot be changed. Christ died for us (Rom. 8:34), and the redemption accomplished by His death is an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). By offering Himself once to God Christ has perfected us forever (Heb. 10:14), and His eternal redemption issues in our eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9). Thus, Christ is able to save us to the uttermost, not only in extent but also in time (Heb. 7:25).</p>
<h2 class="head4">(10) By Christ&rsquo;s Eternal Salvation</h2>
<p>The believers are saved with security by Christ&rsquo;s eternal salvation. Hebrews 5:9 tells us that Christ is the &ldquo;cause of eternal salvation.&rdquo; This verse speaks not of everlasting salvation but of eternal salvation, of which all the effects, benefits, and issues are of an eternal nature, transcending the conditions and limitations of time.</p>
<p>The eternal salvation we have in Christ is based on the eternal redemption He has accomplished for us, which is much better than the temporary atonement carried out by the priests according to the order of Aaron. That temporary atonement covered sin but never put it away, whereas Christ&rsquo;s eternal redemption has put away sin, solving the problem of sin forever. Furthermore, Christ&rsquo;s eternal salvation is not merely an objective redemption to solve our problem of sin on the negative side but also a subjective salvation to save us into His perfection and glorification on the positive side. Such an eternal salvation is not limited by time and space, for it is all-embracing with the divine element and nature. The divine element and nature of Christ are the basic constituents of His eternal salvation, which not only saves us from negative things but also saves us into positive things, even into God Himself. Such a saving is all-embracing, not limited by time and space.</p><h2 class="head4">(11) By Christ&rsquo;s Mighty Hand</h2>
<p>In John 10:28b the Lord Jesus declares concerning His believers, &ldquo;No one shall snatch them out of My hand.&rdquo; The Son&rsquo;s mighty hand is for our protection. Not only the Father&rsquo;s hand but also the Lord&rsquo;s hand will keep us from perishing. No one can snatch us out of the Father&rsquo;s hand nor out of the Lord&rsquo;s hand. We are secured by two divine hands, the Father&rsquo;s hand of love and the Son&rsquo;s hand of grace, both of which are powerful to keep. Because the hands of the Father and the Son will never fail, the believers are eternally secured and will never perish.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(12) By Christ&rsquo;s Unfailing Promise</h2>
<p>Finally, our salvation is secured by Christ&rsquo;s unfailing promise. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and him that comes to Me I will by no means cast out&rdquo; (John 6:37). Here we see that the Lord Jesus promised that He will never reject or forsake anyone who comes to Him.</p>
<p>All the verses concerning the twelve factors of the security of our salvation are clear and unambiguous. These verses give us a solid foundation for the security of our salvation, and nothing can annul them. Therefore, all the believers in Christ may have the proper faith to believe that God&rsquo;s salvation is eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. Clearing the Past</h2>
<p>Now we come to the last matter in the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of regeneration&mdash;clearing the past. The normal experience of regeneration includes the clearing of the past. Once a person has been saved, he will want to make a clearance of his past.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. Not a Fulfillment<br />
of the Requirement for Salvation<br />
but an Issue of the Enjoyment of Salvation</h2>
<p>Clearing the past is not a fulfillment of the requirement for salvation. In other words, it is not necessary for someone to clear the past in order to be saved. The clearing of the past is an issue, a result, of the enjoyment of salvation. When a believer enjoys God&rsquo;s salvation, this enjoyment will cause him to clear the past.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Not Required for the Initial Salvation<br />
but Needed for a Better Christian Life</h2>
<p>The clearing of the past is not required for initial salvation. Initial salvation requires only that we believe in Christ. Although the clearing of the past is not required for initial salvation, it is needed for a better Christian life. If we follow the leading of the Lord within us to clear the past, we shall be enlivened, enlightened, strengthened, and satisfied. We shall also feel peaceful, secure, and full of the presence of the Lord. Then we shall be able to follow the Lord in our Christian life without dragging.</p>
<h2 class="head3">c. Not by Teaching but by the Move of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The clearing of the past is not by teaching but by the move of the Spirit. The religions of the world are built on their various religious codes, and their followers live and behave according to these rules. But the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not like that. The salvation of the Lord, through the regeneration of the Holy Spirit, gives us a new life. Because we have a new life, the divine life, we can now live and behave in the presence of God through the sense of this life and through the moving of the Spirit within us. Hence, the clearing of the past is based on the move of the Spirit. The Spirit will move within a regenerated person and cause him to sense certain things from his past that need to be cleared, for such things are not compatible with his new life as a believer in Christ. Such a believer should then proceed to clear the past according to the move of the Spirit within him.</p><h2 class="head3">d. To Abandon Idols<br />
and the Things Related to Idol Worship</h2>
<p>In clearing the past it is necessary to abandon idols and the things related to idol worship. First Thessalonians 1:9 says that the believers &ldquo;turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.&rdquo; To turn to God from idols is not only to turn away from false gods, with the Devil and demons at their back, but also from all things that replace God. Idols and the things related to idol worship are hated by God and must thoroughly be put to an end and abandoned.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. To Destroy the Demonic<br />
and Dirty Things&mdash;the Improper Things</h2>
<p>The clearing of the past is also to destroy the demonic and dirty things&mdash;the improper things. We have an illustration of this in Acts 19:18 and 19, where the believers at Ephesus had a spontaneous clearing of the past. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;Many of those who believed came, confessing and making known their practices.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;confessing and making known&rdquo; denote the fullest and most open confession. The Greek word translated &ldquo;practices&rdquo; also has the technical meaning of magic spells, and that may be the meaning here. According to verse 19, spontaneously &ldquo;a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.&rdquo; The purpose of this burning was to clear up their sinful and demonic life in the past. The price of the books burned was fifty thousand pieces of silver. Since each piece of silver approximated a day&rsquo;s wage, we can see that these books were worth a great deal of money. Nevertheless, they were publicly burned. This is an illustration of destroying demonic things in order to clear the past. All improper things, things that by their very nature are improper or indecent, need to be put away.</p>
<h2 class="head3">f. To Make Restitution of Base Gains</h2>
<p>The clearing of the past is also to make restitution of base gains. The case of Zaccheus in Luke 19 illustrates this. &ldquo;Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much&rdquo; (v. 8). The word &ldquo;taken&rdquo; here actually refers to extortion. The tax collectors used to put a higher value on property or income, or increase the tax of those unable to pay and then charge usury. Formerly Zaccheus had extorted money from others and thus was unrighteous. Now he put an end to his unrighteous deeds by restoring fourfold. This illustrates the fact that once a sinner receives the Savior, the issue of this dynamic salvation is the clearance of his past sinful life. A believer who makes a thorough clearing of the past will make restitution for anything gained by unjust or illegal means. Things that have been gained unrighteously or illegally should be returned, and restitution for them should be made. We would point out once again, however, that this is not a requirement for salvation but a result of the move of the Spirit. If a believer has a thorough clearing of the past according to the move of the Spirit, the way will be prepared for the living of the Christian life in the future.</p></body></html>
