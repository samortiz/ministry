<p>From the throne proceeds the river of water of life, signifying the Spirit, and this Spirit is God’s flowing out. On the throne, God is the Ruler. He is the One who reigns. But when He comes out, He is the Spirit. In the middle of the street is the river, which is God proceeding out to be life as water to quench the thirst of the entire city. First, the city has a throne and second, a street for administration and fellowship. Third, in the fellowship is the river of water of life. Fourth, there is the tree of life, signifying the second Person of the Godhead.<p>God flows out in the third Person of the Trinity. Then the second Person of the Trinity is Christ, the Son of God, as the tree of life that grows in the river and along its two sides to supply life to nourish the entire city. This picture shows us that with the fellowship street we enjoy the Spirit as the river and Christ as the tree of life. These three things—the street, the river, and the tree of life—reach all the twelve gates, which signify God’s redeemed elect. The divine fellowship brings God to all His redeemed people, to all the twelve gates, to bring all His redeemed people back to Himself. First, the street goes from the throne to the twelve gates. Then it comes from the twelve gates to the throne.<p>Now let us consider the application of this fellowship. In applying this I would like to ask, “Before you were saved, who was your ruler? What was your administration?” You yourself tried to be your own ruler and you were a mess. Actually, you had no ruler or administration. One day you heard the gospel, which said, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (Matt. 3:2). You needed to repent to come under the ruling of God’s kingdom. Before that time you were a person with no ruler and no administration. But you repented to the divine Ruler and came under His administration. Through the gospel God came to be your kingdom. He is the King on the throne. Connected to His throne is a street on which you should walk, and that street is His administration. From the day you repented, you have felt that there is a throne and a golden street, a golden administration, within you. Then you began to do things according to the gold, according to the nature of God. This is because both the throne and the street are built on the gold as the nature of God.<p>When the brothers are buying a tie, they should buy it according to the divine nature within them. Today the shallow gospel never touches this matter. But in the high peak of the gospel we have to see this. The gospel brings us back to God as our throne, to God as our administration. We have to live a life in which we do everything according to God’s nature. Ephesians 4 says that we should let no corrupt word proceed out of our mouth (v. 29). This is because we are children of God. When we speak anything, we need to remember that we are God’s children; we are golden. To speak corrupt things does not match our golden nature. Our nature today is no longer just dusty but golden. If we take this word, it will change our life. We will be adjusted and regulated by the golden nature of God in all that we do. The sisters would not spend so much time to style their hair. That is not according to the golden throne, the golden administration.<p>All of our fellowship should be according to God’s golden nature. The river is in the middle of the street, and the street is the golden nature. In this fellowship is the river, the Holy Spirit, as our beverage and our supply to quench our thirst. Then we also have Christ as the tree of life for our life supply to nourish us. In order to experience all of this, we must be on the golden street, the base of gold. We may feel that it is enough to say that our fellowship with God is our contacting God, and our fellowship with the saints is our contacting the saints. But this is not the deciding factor concerning whether or not our fellowship is the fellowship of God. The fellowship of God must be based upon God’s divine nature. I may go to visit a certain brother every day, but is that the real fellowship? Whether that is the real fellowship or not is determined by whether or not it is based upon the golden nature within me. If my contact with a brother is not based upon the golden nature, then I am making a natural friendship with him. I am not practicing the spiritual fellowship of life based upon God’s divine nature.<p>As we enter into the experience and application of the divine nature of God, we make ourselves genuine parts of the New Jerusalem. Eventually, we become golden in everything. Every department store is a place of temptation where we can depart from the golden nature to buy things. Even in the church life, we can make natural friendships with certain saints, but that is not the genuine fellowship. Fellowship should be based upon the golden nature within us. If we practice this fellowship, we are living as a part of the New Jerusalem. We become the constituents of the New Jerusalem. This is not according to our outward doing but according to our inward being. The inward being of our Christian life must be God’s golden nature. We should live, walk, and do everything based upon the golden nature within us.<p>This is the application of the interpretation of the golden base of the New Jerusalem to the seeking believers. Because God has released the high peak of the divine revelation to us, we all have to learn the high and new language to speak forth the revelation of the New Jerusalem as the greatest and ultimate sign in the Scriptures.
