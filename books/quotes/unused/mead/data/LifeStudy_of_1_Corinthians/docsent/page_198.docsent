   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. A Warning Not to Be Deceived</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 33 says, Do not be deceived, evil companionships corrupt good morals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This appears to be a quotation of another saying of that day, a fragment of a Greek poem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this word the apostle warns the Corinthian believers not to have any companionship with those heretics who say there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such evil companionship will corrupt their faith and Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 33 Paul charges the Corinthians not to pay attention to the deceitful and nonsensical heresy that there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who listen to this heresy will be deceived by it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, if they become companions of heretics, that companionship will corrupt good morals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This principle applies to us in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certain of those who left the Lord s recovery and now speak evil concerning it may try to influence others who have remained in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you take in negative thoughts and become a companion to those who oppose the church life, that companionship will corrupt your church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The good morals mentioned in verse 33 include loving the Lord, living for the future, risking our lives for the gospel, and practicing the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It actually includes all the good things covered in the entire book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 34 Paul continues his charge: Become sober righteously and do not sin, for some are ignorant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I speak to your shame.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To become sober, righteously, is to awaken to soberness from a drunken stupor; it is to cease, righteously, to be drunken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word righteously here means to be right with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To say there is no resurrection offends God and man, and it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the apostle advises the misled Corinthians to awake soberly from this sin to be right with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were drunken unrighteously in a stupor of the no-resurrection heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They needed to cease being in that stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Literally, the words are ignorant are have ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be heretical in saying there is no resurrection is to be ignorant of God, not knowing God s power or His economy Matt 22:29-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a shame to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As Christians, we must be awake to soberness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not be like the Epicureans, who wanted only to enjoy life and did not care for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to cease, righteously, to be drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anyone who says that there is no resurrection is not righteous with God or man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, those who oppose the church life are not right with either God or man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once I received a letter from a brother who acknowledged that I had helped him to know Christ and experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was grateful for this help, and also for help in knowing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But then he went on to say that my teaching regarding the church life, especially the church ground, is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is unrighteous to say that to teach the believers to practice the church life is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This saying is unrighteous both toward God and toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anyone who makes such a statement or who agrees with it needs to awaken as from a drunken stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today there are many heretical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of these teachings may contain only a small percentage of heresy, and others, a much larger percentage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you know why you are willing to accept a certain kind of heresy?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is because you have a tendency, an inner inclination, toward that heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It fits your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then, because you take in a heretical teaching to match your taste, you become drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Knowing the situation among the Corinthians, Paul warned them not to accept the heresy which denies the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He knew this would involve an evil companionship that would corrupt their morals in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this we see that resurrection certainly has a positive influence on our morals.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But to deny the resurrection will corrupt our morals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It will cause us to be shipwrecked.</S>
