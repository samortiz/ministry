<h2 class="head1">A HISTORY OF KNOWING CHRIST</h2><p>Those who know Christ surely have a history of the knowledge of Christ. If you do not have a history of the knowledge of Christ, you cannot say that you know Christ. If you have to teach others about bearing the cross, can you relate to others the reality of bearing the cross? If you have to speak to others about the power of resurrection, do you have the experience of the power of resurrection? You can tell others about humility, but do you have the humility that is different from your natural disposition and that comes from the power of resurrection? When you speak to others about patience, do you have the experience? Were you an impatient person who experienced the power of resurrection changing you and making you patient? You may be able to speak about the doctrine of resurrection and ascension, but do you have a testimony that you are transcendent and untouched by the things of the earth? If you do not have such a testimony, you cannot preach such a truth. If you do not know Christ, you are not qualified to be a witness of Christ. Friends, I am not mocking you; I am pleading with you. If your experience of Christ is not deep enough, you are not qualified to be a worker of the Lord.</p><p>When I was in Shanghai, many brothers came from various localities to learn some lessons. Many of them think that they can be preachers after they return home. They think that they have learned about the way to meet. They think that they know all about the breaking of bread, baptism, and the laying on of hands. They think that they are ready to return once they have learned these things and are able to speak about them. They think that all they need is a little knowledge about the Bible and the ability to speak about it. You must realize that there is not such a thing. You may know all the teachings, but can you speak to others about the things that have gone on between you and Christ? Can you speak about your experience of Christ? You have to see that only the Christ you have experienced will supply and render help to others.</p><p>Three hundred years ago, there was a famous theologian called Bengal who had a few students. At that time, theologians were different from those of today; they took only a few students. One student studied the book of Romans under Bengal. He was told to study nothing but Romans for a period of time. One day the student came to him as he was reading a book and said, "I have discovered the doctrine of sin in the book of Romans." When Bengal heard this, he jumped up in surprise, and said, "You have discovered only the doctrine of sin in the book of Romans. Have you not discovered sin within yourself and in your daily life?" If we do not find sin in ourselves, and if all that we know is the doctrine of sin in the book of Romans, and then tell others to hate sin, deal with sin, and not live by the flesh, what good will this do? If we have never been freed from the power of sin, how can we free others?</p><p>We are after something concrete, not a doctrine. Let me tell you a secret: If you listen to a man's preaching and find nothing behind his words, you can ignore his preaching. Every time we stand up to speak, we should dispense something concrete and real to others; we cannot merely give others some doctrines. The only things that will work are the real things that are behind the doctrines. Doctrines alone amount to nothing.</p><h2 class="head1">DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>Paul said in Philippians 3 that we have to know Christ and the power of His resurrection. Why did Paul not say the power of the cross? Why did he only say the power of resurrection? This is because the cross is a negative death, a termination and an end. However, resurrection is something positive; it is a life that is raised from death, a regaining after a termination. Resurrection is something that has come out of death; it is something beyond the natural realm. It is what is perfected through death. Has your eloquence passed through death? Death will not make your mouth lose its ability to function, but it will terminate the activity of your mouth, and in resurrection you will regain this activity. Have your thoughts passed through the terminating death and returned to you from God in resurrection? Is your work in the realm of ordinary living, or is it in the realm of resur- rection? The realm of ordinary living is the natural realm, whereas the realm of resurrection is what is perfected through death. The realm of ordinary living is what we have inherited from our parents, whereas the realm of resurrection is what we receive from God.</p><p>What is resurrection? It is that which has passed through death and which has come out of death. Resurrection is that which has been perfected by death and is reinstated. For example, you may have wisdom, eloquence, and natural attraction. You have to say to the Lord, "I will not employ these things. I will not claim these things for my own glory. I am willing to go through death and resurrection and to give these things up in death so that I can claim them back from God's hand." The experience of resurrection is letting go of everything that is natural through death, not trusting in them any longer, and not glorying in them. It is as if you are dead&mdash;your hands are dead, your eloquence is dead, and your natural attraction is dead. Everything that you have is gone, and you cannot do anything anymore. After some time, perhaps three days, three months, or three years (no one knows how long it will be), God comes in again, and your eloquence is returned to you, your wisdom is returned to you, and your attraction comes back. However, even though you have regained these things, they have changed. Your natural goodness and everything you naturally have are no longer yours; a cross now separates you from these things. You dare not use these things any longer, leaving them instead to the Lord to be employed according to His pleasure. These things are no longer your own; instead, you recognize them as God's.</p><p>This kind of loss through death and gaining in return is what resurrection is all about. Luke 15 says, "Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found" (v. 24). Resurrection is being lost and found again. How much of yourself has been lost? I know many people who desire to work for the Lord. I would ask them a most honest question: "Are you lost? Have you lost what you think the Lord can use?" We have to know that natural goodness can never come into the Lord's service. We have to lose these things in death. It is a blessing to lose in death, for then you will begin to know resurrection.</p><p>In our daily life, whenever we die and live again, we have another experience of death and resurrection. The experience of death and resurrection is a cycle; it puts everything in Adam, both good and bad, through death, and gives it back to us in Christ. The process of death and regaining puts us on the ground of resurrection, and qualifies us to express the power of the Spirit. I like the story of Matthias. Many people think that the story of Matthias was nothing more than a process of making up the number of the apostles. Actually there is more to it. Acts 1 records that Judas lost his allotted portion among the apostles and had gone to his own place. The disciples had to choose from among the men who accompanied them during the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among them, beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which the Lord was taken up from them. They had to choose one of these to be a witness of His resurrection with them (vv. 16-22). This means that one had to be chosen from among those who had been with the Lord from the time of John's preaching of repentance and the Lord's baptism, that is, the beginning of the Lord's work, to the time of His death and resurrection. The one who was chosen had to be a witness and wait together with them in Jerusalem for the power of the Holy Spirit. The apostles who waited in Jerusalem for the power of the Holy Spirit did not go out to work right away. They remained in Jerusalem. They were able to remain in Jerusalem because there was a history and background between them and the Lord already. Only those who have had such a history and background can receive the power of the Holy Spirit to be a witness of the resurrection of Christ.</p><p>The only kind of people who can be witnesses for Christ are those who know Him and know the power of His resurrection. Please remember that everyone who desires to be a witness for Christ must know what it means to lose in death and regain in resurrection. Only those who have a history with Christ, who have experienced His death and resurrection, and who know the power of His resurrection are qualified to be a witness for the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p>
