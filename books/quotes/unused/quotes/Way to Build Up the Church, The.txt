We are the containers made by God therefore He purposely created a spirit within us in order to receive Him to keep Him and to express Him
Within this corporate man, God in Christ is the Head and, as sons, we are the Body brought into order under His headship
In order for man to exist, God prepared many material things, including food, water, clothing, housing, and many other things
All the Gentiles are distracted from God's central mark by the material things; they are fully drawn to the material things
Not only have the Gentiles been distracted from God's eternal purpose, but even the Jews, the chosen people of God, have been distracted
Not just the Gentiles and the Jews, but even Christian people are distracted from Christ and His Body unto something else
Even fundamental Christianity tells us only that God loves us and sent His Son to die on the cross in order to save us from hell
All most Christians know is that God loves us; and if we believe in Him, some day we will go to dwell with Him in heaven after we die
Some Christians who say that this is not enough are looking for the manifestations of gifts to prove that God is powerful
We can testify after many years of experience that if we will take care of God's purpose, God will take care of our needs
In Ephesians, the major Epistle concerning the church, there is no mention of material things, knowledge, or gifts
In the fourth chapter, the gifts mentioned are the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Chapter four shows us how to grow on the basis of the experiences of the unsearchable riches of Christ mentioned in chapter three
The Body of Christ cannot be built up by knowledge; neither can it be built up by the gifts, or the so-called supernatural manifestations
The book of Ephesians is the heart of the Scriptures, and the heart of this book is in chapter three, verses 16-19
Paul bows his knees for the cause of God's eternal purpose that God would grant the saints to be strengthened in the inner man
It is by repentance and confession that the two main parts of the heart, the mind and the conscience, are opened
The gateway to the spirit is opened so that the Lord may come in more and more in order to fill and strengthen our spirit
When we repent and confess in this way, our emotion will follow with love to the Lord, and our will then will choose to seek the Lord
The Lord, as the living Spirit, will infill and strengthen our spirit; and spontaneously, Christ will make His home in our heart
Christ is now in our spirit, but He is imprisoned there because our mind is set on other things and our conscience is not exercised
When we have Christ making His home in us, we will forget about the knowledge, the divisions, and all other things
We are no longer individuals, but we are built up corporately with all the saints to realize how immeasurable Christ is
We are not to be filled with material things, scriptural knowledge, nor the so-called spiritual gifts, but with God Himself
The more knowledge we have, the more divisions we will have; and the more gifts we have, the more trouble we will have
The inner man must be strengthened so that Christ will make His home in our hearts and we will grow up into Him in all things
We will be filled unto all the fullness of God, by whom we will be built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
