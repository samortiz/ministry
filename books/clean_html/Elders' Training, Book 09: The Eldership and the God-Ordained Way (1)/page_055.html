<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Home Meetings</H2><P>Although we have seen the light concerning how to preach the gospel in the most effective way, we still are not too clear regarding how to have the home meetings. For this one thing I reconsidered the entire New Testament chapter by chapter. The first mention of something related to the home meetings is in Matthew 18:20: "For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst." Later we are told in Acts that the early believers met from house to house (2:46; 5:42). The phrase "from house to house" means "according to houses." This means that every believer's house had a meeting. The number of meetings equalled the number of the believers' houses. The Epistles show us that the early churches often met in a certain saint's home, such as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (Rom. 16:5), the church in the house of Nymphas (Col. 4:15-16), and the church in the house of Philemon (Philem. 2).</P><P>Although we know these things concerning the home meetings, we still cannot find much in the New Testament regarding how to have the home meetings. After we learned the proper way of preaching the gospel according to God's ordained way as revealed in the Bible, we began to ask how we should take care of the home meetings. At first, the trainees in Taipei used Truth Lessons for their home meetings. Later, we published Life Lessons specifically to take care of the home meetings with the newly baptized ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Small Group Meetings</H2><P>The New Testament does not say much about how to have the small group meetings. Matthew 18:20 refers to two or three being gathered together. This may be considered also as a small group. Acts 12 says that while Peter was imprisoned, the saints came together to pray in Mary's home (v. 12). This may also be considered as a group meeting. In Hebrews 10:25 Paul says, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...but exhorting one another." This verse may indicate a group meeting. The above three verses, however, do not tell us what to do in a group meeting. This is all that the New Testament says concerning this matter.</P>
