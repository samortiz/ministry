   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. The Children of Israel,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Fallen in Nature, Not Measuring Up</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Keep the Commandments,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Statutes, and Judgments of Their God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel, being fallen in nature, surely would not measure up to keep the commandments, statutes, and judgments of their God; thus they would come under all the curses listed in verses 15 through 26.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, right beside the stones of the inscriptions of the commandments of God was the altar, where they could take Christ as their burnt offering to God for His satisfaction and take Christ as their burnt offering and peace offering to God for God's satisfaction and their enjoyment with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that the altar was prepared before the curses were declared.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before we believed into Christ and were saved, we were cursed under God's commandments, statutes, and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through Christ we have been redeemed "out of the curse of the law" Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has provided an altar, the cross of Christ, and at the cross we take Christ as the burnt offering offered to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also take Christ as our burnt offering and peace offering for God's satisfaction and our enjoyment with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The peace offering is food for both God and us, and we enjoy this food in the presence of God as we have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At one time, we were cursed under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But praise the Lord for the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this universe there is not only a book of law under which we are cursed; there is also the cross through which redemption has been accomplished by God's grace according to God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we have come to the cross, we are now under the cross and are no longer under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As those who are under the cross, we can satisfy God, and also find satisfaction for ourselves, through Christ, our Redeemer and our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through Christ, who is our peace, we have peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law is over, and the cross stands forever.</S>
