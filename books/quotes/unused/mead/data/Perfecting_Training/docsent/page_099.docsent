   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GENUINE HELP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For almost fifty years I have been serving and teaching the saints, but I am afraid that some of the help that I rendered to them was not so genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The genuine help, the real help, is just to get the saints into the touch with the Lord that will let the automatic law work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the law of the Spirit of life works in such a one, it will reduce his problem and solve his problem and kill some of his germs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the genuine help.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes a medical doctor may not give you the genuine healing, but just a kind of temporary soothing and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, we sometimes feel we have received some spiritual help, but several weeks later we are still sick.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The real help is to get into this touch with the Lord that will cause the automatic law of the Spirit of life to operate within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, you cannot help others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul planted, but he could not give life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apollos watered, but Apollos could not give growth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only God could give growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I may, in certain difficult problems, help you temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But only the automatic working law can kill the real source.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the law of the Spirit of life can reduce your natural life and deal with the real germ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the genuine help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times I have used a married couple as an example, saying that the wife helps the husband to grow, and the husband helps the wife to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But actually I doubt whether any wife has ever helped a husband to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At most she may help him to learn some patience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, inside there is not much change.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The genuine help is to bring a wife or a husband into the touch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8 automatically works scientifically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the negative elements and the positive elements in the law will operate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though we may not know so many of the things within us, when this law works within us, it reduces and eliminates.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does away with the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When your wife irritates you or provokes you, you won t need to gnash your teeth because that ugly thing within you has been reduced and eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes the reducing is not up to standard, and we need more time remaining in the touch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through the years many so-called spiritual giants have encouraged people to contact the Lord, to fellowship with the Lord, to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But even they themselves didn t get into the principle in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They only enjoyed the result to some extent, so they encouraged people to practice certain things and to enjoy certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we don t need this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We just need to come into the touch with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to pray, Lord, I just come to touch You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have nothing to ask of You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I don t even like to ask You to do anything for me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I just like to remain in the touch with You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do have some burden to pray for Your recovery, for Your interest, yet I don t like to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I just like to remain in this touch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your experience will confirm that if you practice this you will experience a lot of killing, a lot of reducing, a lot of strengthening, a lot of resurrecting, a lot of rising up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the law working in you scientifically.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This law includes the weakness of the law being killed already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The impossibility of the law is done away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no more impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it is full of possibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The righteous requirement of the law is spontaneously fulfilled in you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not that you are fulfilling the requirement, but that the requirement is fulfilled in you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, it is not just by accident and just according to mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a matter of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The electricity does not heat your room according to mercy, but according to law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us come back to this automatic law that works scientifically.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Dear saints, just stay in the contact with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Something in you will spontaneously work in a scientific way to solve this problem for you and to deal with that thing for you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although you may not know there was such a thing in you, that thing will have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After you have stayed in this contact for a certain period of time, you will realize experientially that within you there has been a kind of clearing up, a kind of dealing, a kind of release, a kind of rising up, a kind of soaring in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the result of the scientific working of this automatic law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the very God who is now indwelling you and working, not as God, but as a law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me.</S>
