   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Pushing like an Ox</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Deuteronomy 33:17 says, "His majesty is like the firstborn of his ox, and his horns are like the horns of a wild ox: with them he shall push the peoples together to the ends of the earth: and these are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph is likened to a pushing ox.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message I pointed out that when Christ comes back, He will push the Russians away from the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I definitely believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we also may experience Joseph as a pushing ox today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As I have considered my past experiences and the experiences of Brother Nee, I realize that I have certainly seen the pushing victory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The opposers joined forces to squeeze us, but there was the pushing victory, the pushing strength, and the pushing horns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wait for a while, and you will see Joseph's pushing strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Joseph is fruitful, and he is victorious in tearing and in pushing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We in the Lord's recovery today are all Josephs strong in tearing the opposition and in pushing the opposition away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of you have read the booklet entitled, What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although this booklet has been out for several months, no one has written a booklet in reply to it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mouths of the opposers have been shut, and their writing hands have been amputated, for they have no way to take care of Isaiah 9:6 and 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how some may twist Isaiah 9:6, they cannot eliminate the title Father found here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse says that a Son is given to us and that His name is called the everlasting Father, or the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Father certainly is the Father of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you say that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is not the Father of the Godhead, then you hold the heresy of believing in two divine Fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in the whole universe there is only one source, the Father in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There cannot be another Father as another source.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not tell me about history or about the Nicene Creed or any other creed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not care for the creeds I only care for the pure word in Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some, opposing us, have twisted this verse and said, "It says a spirit,' not the Spirit.'"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But do not forget the modifier "life-giving."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse speaks of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you believe that this Spirit is different from the Holy Spirit of the Godhead?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If so, then you believe in two life-giving Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fighting this battle, I am a wolf tearing the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of the opposers appeal to the Nicene Creed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Nicene Creed is like a pair of shoes two inches long, but our feet are twelve inches long.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you intend to cut your feet to fit into your little shoes, or will you get a pair of shoes to fit your feet?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits, but are the seven Spirits covered by the Nicene Creed?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Testament also speaks of the life-giving Spirit, but does the Nicene Creed contain any reference to the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, that pair of shoes is too short.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The vision we have is much greater than what is contained in that creed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must not reduce the vision to match the shoes; rather, we must throw away those old shoes and take the pure word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let all of Christianity oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, we shall see what the outcome will be.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Lord's recovery we have both the tearing strength and the pushing strength.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sooner or later, the enemy will not only be defeated and subdued; he will unconditionally surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is leading us in triumph 2 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The truth is the truth, Joseph is Joseph, and Benjamin is Benjamin.</S>
