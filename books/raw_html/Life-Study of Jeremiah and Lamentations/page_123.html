<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THERE BEING A GREAT DAY,<br>A TIME OF DISTRESS, FOR ISRAEL</H2><P>Jeremiah 30:5-8 reveals that there will be a great day, a time of distress, for Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Time of the Great Tribulation<br>for Three and a Half Years</H2><P>Verse 7a says, "Alas! For that day is great, / And there is none like it; / And it is a time of distress for Jacob." This great day, this time of distress, is the time of the great tribulation for three and a half years (Matt. 24:21; Dan. 12:7b; Rev. 13:5, 7a). Jeremiah 30 refers to the great tribulation during the last three and a half years of this age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.

Jehovah Breaking Israel's Yoke<br>from upon Her Neck<br>and Tearing Off Her Bonds</H2><P>In Jeremiah 30:8 Jehovah promised that, in that day, He will break the yoke from upon Israel's neck and tear off her bonds. The strangers will no longer make her serve them.</P>
