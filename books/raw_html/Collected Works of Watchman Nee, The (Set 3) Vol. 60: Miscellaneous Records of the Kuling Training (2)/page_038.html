<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 31, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">BOTH THE CONDITION OF SALVATION<br />AND THE RESULT OF SALVATION<br />BEING ACCOMPLISHED BY GOD</h2><h2 class="head2">The Condition and the Result<br />of Salvation Being One</h2><p>Today we will consider the condition and result of salvation. The common concept is that these two things are very different, that is, that we are responsible for the condition of salvation while God is responsible for the result of salvation. We cannot find one example in this world in which the means and the goal are the same. We know that there are conditions that lead to salvation. For example, repentance is a condition. Forgiveness, however, is a result. Similarly, believing is a condition, while salvation is a result. A man must know the Lord before he can have life. Knowing the Lord is a condition, while having life is a result. There is even a difference between salvation itself and the receiving of life. Salvation is a condition for receiving life, while loving the Lord is a result of having this life. A man must be saved before he can be part of God's people, and he must be part of God's people before he is qualified to live the life of a child of God. Hence, being part of God's people is a condition, while living the life of a child of God is the result. A man must be saved before he can be free from the sins of the flesh. Here salvation is the condition and freedom from sin is the result.</p><p>We all think that salvation is one thing, the condition of salvation is another thing, and the result of salvation is yet a third thing. But the Bible speaks of the condition and result of salvation in a mixed-up way; there is no way to separate the two. In preaching the gospel, it is very hard to explain the condition for salvation and the result of salvation as if they were separate items. It is foolish to try to break them down and analyze them as two separate things. The Lord has no intention of making a clear separation between the condition and the result of salvation. This is not a confusion but a most glorious acknowledgment of fact. This prompts us to greater worship. The condition of salvation is the same as the result of salvation, and the result of salvation is the same as the condition of salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">CLEAR PROOFS IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>We can find a few proofs of this in the Bible. Let us first read Luke 18 and 19. In Luke 18:18-27 a young ruler came to the Lord Jesus and asked, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" The young ruler wanted eternal life, and he came to ask about the condition for receiving it. He wanted to know what he first needed to do to receive eternal life. The Lord Jesus told him to keep all the commandments. The young man responded readily, "All these things I have kept from my youth." The Lord Jesus then told him to sell his all and give to the poor, and then to follow Him. That is the way to inherit eternal life. At this word, the young ruler went away in sorrow because he could not do it. When the Lord saw him turning away, he said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God." In saying this, the Lord equated receiving eternal life with entering God's kingdom. When the disciples heard this, they said, "Then who can be saved?" They put all three things&mdash;inheriting eternal life, entering God's kingdom, and being saved&mdash;together. With God, all three things are possible. These three things&mdash;salvation, receiving eternal life, and entering God's kingdom&mdash;are results. The one condition is to sell everything and to follow the Lord.</p><p>Moving on to Luke 19:1-10, there is the story of Zaccheus's salvation. As soon as he was saved, he declared that he would give half of his possessions to the poor and restore four times what he had taken from others by false accusation. In chapter eighteen there is a young, moral ruler. In chapter nineteen there is a middle-aged, immoral tax collector. What is seen as a condition for salvation in chapter eighteen becomes a result of salvation in chapter nineteen. In chapter eighteen the condition for salvation is selling one's possessions. But in chapter nineteen, giving up of one's possessions becomes the result of salvation and even salvation itself. Luke 18 and 19 are completely opposite. We know that if something is a condition, it requires work on our part, and that if it is a result, it is God's work. The Lord said that the condition for entering God's kingdom is to sell everything, but He also said that what is impossible with man is possible with God. This means that we cannot sell everything by ourselves; God has to be the One who does this for us. Here we see that the condition of salvation is also salvation itself. We think that the condition is fulfilled by us while the result is accomplished by God. But the Lord said that even the condition of salvation is accomplished by God Himself. If salvation depends on our work, no one will be saved. The Lord said that what is impossible with man is possible with God. This incorporates the condition for salvation into salvation itself. In other words, God does everything. This does not say that what is possible with man should be done by man, and what is impossible with man should be taken up by God. Rather, it says that man does not have to do anything; God does everything.</p>
