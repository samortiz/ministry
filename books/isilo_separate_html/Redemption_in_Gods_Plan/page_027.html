<p>After the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation, He brought the man whom He had redeemed into the new creation through His resurrection. We were the old creation; His death terminated Adam and everything of Adam. It terminated our old man and old life, that is, what we were in the old creation (v. 6). Then the resurrection of the Lord Jesus caused us to partake of Him and receive His life for regeneration. In this way we were made the new creation: &ldquo;The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>Unlike the old creation, the new creation is not another man who has been created by God with His power but is apart from Him. The new creation is man in union with God, created by God with His life in Himself (Eph. 4:24). The old creation does not have the element of God&rsquo;s life and nature; it has only man&rsquo;s element. The new creation, however, has the element of God&rsquo;s life and nature through the mingling of God and man. The new creation is the redeemed creature mingled with the life of the Creator so that creature and Creator are joined as one.</p>
<p>God has not yet made all things new because the new heaven and the new earth have not yet come, and the New Jerusalem has not yet been manifested (Rev. 21:1-5). However, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection has made us a new creation and the firstfruits of His creatures (2 Cor. 5:17; James 1:18). In this new creation we have been given a foretaste of the manifestation of the New Jerusalem that is full of God&rsquo;s light and life, in which the righteousness of God dwells (2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:23&mdash;22:5). Righteousness dwells in the new creation, and the new creation is full of life and light. In the new creation there is no unrighteousness, death, or darkness; there is only righteousness, life, and light. This is the result of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Us His Brothers</h2>
<p>Originally, the Lord Jesus was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son, (John 1:18; 3:16), the One who had God&rsquo;s life and bore God&rsquo;s expression. According to His eternal plan, however, God desires that many would have the life of His Son, become His sons, and receive the sonship. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus fulfilled this purpose in God&rsquo;s plan. Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection God regenerated us so that we would have His life and become His many sons. Originally God had only one Son, the only begotten Son, but through His resurrection Christ became the Firstborn among many brothers, the many sons who were regenerated through His resurrection (Rom. 8:29; 1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus died, He called His disciples friends (John 15:15), but on the morning of His resurrection He called them brothers (Matt. 28:10). This is because His resurrection caused the disciples to receive His life and become His brothers and God&rsquo;s sons. Just as God is the Father of the Lord Jesus, He is also the Father of the Lord&rsquo;s brothers (John 20:17). On the day of His resurrection the life of the Son of God entered into the disciples, and they received the divine life. Thus, they were all of One. This is the reason that He is not ashamed to call them brothers (Heb. 2:11).</p>
<p>At first, the Lord Jesus was the only grain, but now He has borne &ldquo;much fruit&rdquo; (John 12:24). This fruit is the same as He is in life and nature. Originally, He was the only begotten Son of God; now He is the Firstborn among many brothers. Originally, He alone had the life of God and was able to know God (Matt. 11:27); now He can declare the name of God to His many brothers and lead them to know God because they have the same divine life. He has entered into glory (Luke 24:26), and He will lead His many brothers, God&rsquo;s many sons, into glory as well.</p>
<p>The resurrection of the Lord brings us to a point where we are exactly the same as He is, having the life of God in order to express God. We are sons of God with Him; we are His brothers and partners. The sonship that we received in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection is the top blessing in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Us the Church</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:12 says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo; This verse is quoted from Psalm 22:22. In this psalm the Spirit of Christ describes through the mouth of David the sufferings of Christ&rsquo;s death. The words quoted in Hebrews 2:12 from this psalm are spoken in the context of the resurrection of Christ. This verse shows that the brothers, produced by Christ in His resurrection, are the church. Individually speaking, those who were regenerated in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection are His brothers; collectively speaking, they are the church, His Body.</p>
<p>Just as Eve was brought forth when Adam was awakened from his sleep (Gen. 2:21-22), the church was produced when Christ was resurrected from the dead. He is the grain of wheat that died and has grown to become many grains (John 12:24). Collectively, the many grains are the church, the corporate expression of Christ. In incarnation the life of God entered into one person, Jesus the Nazarene, through whom God was expressed. Through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection the life of God entered into many people, through whom God is expressed corporately. This corporate entity is the church, which is composed of those who have received God&rsquo;s life through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. We are the church because of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Christ produced the church with His life through His resurrection. The church was produced in the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST FULFILLING<br />
THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection brought about the positive aspects of God&rsquo;s redemption. Although Christ&rsquo;s death accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption, His death mainly dealt with the negative aspects of our problems before God. The resurrection of Christ, however, allowed God to fulfill His plan and attain His positive goal. The death of Christ is the foundation of His redemption and the basis for His resurrection, but the accomplishments of His death were made effective and real to us through His resurrection. Therefore, a person who desires to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation must believe in His resurrection (Rom. 10:9). When we testify for the Lord, we also must testify concerning His resurrection (Acts 1:22; 2:32; 3:15; 4:33).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
