   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF A RIGHT SPIRIT TO SERVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here we face a problem: What kind of spirit is a right spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What kind of spirit is a wrong spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The above passage tells us that it is not enough to serve the Lord, love Him, and be zealous for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to know how our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize that a man is disapproved not because his conduct is wrong but because his spirit is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The disciples were right in their zeal and love for the Lord; they were very scriptural, but because their spirit was wrong, everything was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man approves others based on conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if a Christian approves others based on conduct, he has lowered the standard of spiritual things to its very lowest point.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With many people the controversy is conduct, but the Lord looks at a man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The disciples might have been zealous for the Lord, but they were rebuked because their spirit was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord pays attention to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man pays attention to conduct, Bible knowledge, zeal, and love, but the standard of the Christian life is based on the spirit, not on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue is the spirit, not events and work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many young people argue about events and work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord's eyes are not on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PAYING ATTENTION TO THE RIGHTNESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that they did not know their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see a strange thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>James and John were speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They were asking on behalf of the Lord for God to send fire from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord did not rebuke them for saying the wrong words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He only rebuked them for having a wrong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among the saints, the most frequent controversy we hear is whose words are right and whose words are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I never argue about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times the brothers and sisters hear me say, "Your words are right, but your spirit is wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord was not concerned about the rightness of the disciples' words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Behind the words, however, was the expression of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Was the spirit right?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not our words are right is a separate issue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our spirit comes out as soon as we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The spirit that comes out of us may be a right spirit or it may be a wrong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not emphasize merely the rightness of our words, but should consider the spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>KNOWING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's words show us that a man can have a wrong spirit yet be completely ignorant of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man may be completely ignorant of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>James and John trusted in themselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They wanted to repeat what Elijah had done.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They did not realize that their spirit was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not surprising for a person to have a wrong spirit, but it is a strange thing for a man to have a wrong spirit yet not know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is easy to recover a person who has erred in his spirit, but it is hard to recover one who does not know that he has erred in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most horrible thing is not to sin but to sin and be ignorant of it, thinking all the while that you are doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is hard to awaken those who are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A child may have a black face without knowing anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he comes into a room and others laugh at him, he may think that others like him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I tremble for those who have a wrong spirit but do not know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The trouble is not the mistake itself, but the absence of revelation and light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words a man speaks tell us the kind of spirit he has.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But often a man does not know what kind of spirit he has.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Solomon said no one knows his own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only foolish ones say that they know their own heart Prov 28:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man cannot say that he does not have a spirit just because he does not know that he has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same way, a man cannot say that there is nothing wrong with his spirit just because he does not know that his spirit is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man's spirit is wrong, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he speaks, his spirit is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The disciples volunteered to vindicate the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the Lord's word shows us that they did not know their spirit, they did not know themselves, and they did not know that their spirit was in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we speak, we may not know our spirit, and we may not know that our spirit is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But those who listen know immediately that our spirit is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The experienced ones who stand next to us know immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A man's word can be very scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He can be zealous for the Lord, but if he does not have a right spirit, those who are in fellowship with the Lord will know immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope our brothers and sisters will learn before the Lord that God's standard for the Christian life is not just something scriptural, moral, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our walk should issue from a right spirit.</S>
