<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LIFE AND TRANSFORMATION<br>OF THE CHURCH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE POSITION OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Matthew 13:45-46 says, "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls; and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it."</P><P>In Matthew 13 the Lord spoke seven parables. The parable concerning the pearl of great value is the sixth. These seven parables give us a full picture of this age until the Lord comes back. In this picture we can see where the church should stand. By these parables we can see the position of the church.</P><P>In order to help us understand the parable of the pearl of great value, we have to read Ephesians 5. Let us begin with verse 25: "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her." That merchant found a pearl and went and sold all that he had. This merchant signifies Christ who loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Verse 26 goes on to say, "That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word." The washing of the water in the word is the washing of life, the divine life, the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Then verses 27 through 32 say, "That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish...because we are members of His Body. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church." This portion of the Word helps us to see the pearl of great value for which the Lord gave all that He had. This pearl of great value refers to the church. In the eyes of the Lord, the church is a pearl of great value.</P><P>Now we want to remind you of the eleven items which we saw in the previous chapter. First, in the Old Testament there are seven items: the man, the wife, the house, the tabernacle, the temple, the city, and the army. Then in the New Testament there are four items: the Body, the fullness, the vessel, and the lampstand. Eventually, the New Jerusalem is the twelfth item. The entire Scripture is a record of these twelve items. Actually, these eleven items added together equal the twelfth item, the last item, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the eleven items; it is the all-inclusive item.</P><P>Of course, the whole Scripture speaks about Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). There is no doubt about this. This divine, heavenly book gives us a full revelation of the Triune God. It tells us that the Father is the source, the Son is the embodiment and the expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the transmission of the Son, the fellowship of the Father in the Son. It reveals to us the Triune God as life and everything to us. We will need our whole life, even all of eternity, to know and experience the Triune God, to experience God in Christ as the Spirit as life and everything to us.</P><P>However, we have to realize that for us to experience the Triune God in a full way, we need the church. This is just like saying a life needs a body, a husband needs a wife, a dweller needs a house, a commander needs an army, a ruler needs a city, the head needs a body, the reality needs the fullness, the content needs a container, and the lamp needs a lampstand. In the universe all things are of two sides. There is heaven and there is earth. There are men and there are women. There is the front and there is the back. There are the head and the body, the masters and the servants, the parents and the children, etc. Everything in the universe is always of two sides.</P><P>My point is this. The problem today is not with the Triune God or with Christ. The problem today is with the church. The problem today is not with the Head but with the Body. With Christ as the divine, eternal, heavenly Husband, there is no problem. But what about the church as the wife? With Christ as the Head, there is no problem. But what about the church as the Body? There is no problem with the Triune God as the Dweller, but what about the church as the house? Even we have to ask, "Where is the house?"</P><P>If you read the Scripture thoroughly, from the beginning to the end, you will realize that the Triune God is trying His best to gain something for Himself. This is like gaining a man for the life, a wife for the husband, a house, a tabernacle, and a temple for the dweller, a city for the ruler, an army for the commander, a body for the head, the fullness for the reality, a vessel, a container, for the content, and a lampstand for the lamp with the light.</P><P>The first chapter of the Scripture deals with man and the second chapter deals with the wife. The section from the third chapter up to the beginning of the second book, Exodus, deals with the house. Then all the books from Exodus to the Chronicles deal with the tabernacle. The section from Chronicles to Malachi deals with the city, including the temple with the army. This covers the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament. If you want to understand the Old Testament, you need to have a thorough realization of these seven things: a man, a wife, a house, a tabernacle, a temple, an army, and a city. Then in the New Testament four things are dealt with: the Body of Christ, the fullness, the vessel, and the lampstand. Eventually, the seven items in the Old Testament plus the four items in the New Testament equal the New Jerusalem. This is the whole Scripture.</P>
