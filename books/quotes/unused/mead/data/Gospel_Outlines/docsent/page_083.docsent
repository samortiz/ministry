   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Receiving Jesus</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people still think Jesus is only a great man, although they have received Jesus and have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Still they do not know who Jesus really is; they will only learn that He is the Lord after He performs a miracle in their home or in their career.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Christians do not know the Lord for their whole life.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only when you meet Jesus do you really see your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s salvation As soon as Peter confessed that he was a sinner, the Lord said, From henceforth thou shalt catch men.</S>
