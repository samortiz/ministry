   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH AS GOD S FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Ephesians also reveals that the church is the family of God Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sonship and the family are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are not in the sonship, you do not belong to the family because the family is based upon the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While sonship indicates source and implies nature, the family denotes our household life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our life should not be an individual life, but a family life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I do not like to see the brothers and sisters get married when they are still teenagers, I like to see them get married at a proper age and then become parents of two or more children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is family life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Family life kills your individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am concerned for some among us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although they are good brothers and sisters, their individualism has never been killed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you know what can kill your individualism?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly, your husband or wife, and then your children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you get married, you gain someone who kills your individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Day by day in the family life of the church we are suffering the killing of our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you ever sensed that, in the church life, you are under someone s killing?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of my children have said, Daddy, you have too many children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I wish I were just by myself and didn t have so many brothers and sisters, because they all bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord that the church life is a family life!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God the Father has no intention of having individual sons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His intention is to have a family, and we are His family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we all belong to the family, some naughty ones do not like to remain with the family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, they prefer to be off somewhere by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of you may still hold to your preference of being away from your brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You enjoy being isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if you consider the human situation, you will see that mankind does not depend upon individuals, but upon the family.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s unit is corporate; it is not the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He does not want you to be an only son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You cannot be His only son, for He already has His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must be a member of His family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Greek, the word for family or household is the same as the word for house, or dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, the church is God s dwelling place, God s house and home 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, the family is different from the house, but in the New Testament the house and the family are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In some cases it is difficult to determine whether to translate the Greek word as house or as household.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both are correct.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God s eyes, the house is the family, and the family is the house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Individually you and I could never be God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s house is a corporate matter, not an individual one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we say that we are the church, then we must examine ourselves to see whether we are God s house, God s dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we say that we are the church of God, then we must be God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many talk about the church, but they do not have the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reality of the church is that it is God s residence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God dwells there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do we have the residence of God among us?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not, then we are not qualified to say that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are a so-called church, but we lack the divine residence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In relation to the Father, the church is the sonship and the household.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we must see what the church is in relation to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All Christians know that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ s Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This term, however, has been used in a very loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After coming to this country, I heard a lot of talk about Body ministry and the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What was described as Body ministry eventually turned out to be something absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others said that they had the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But I wondered where the Head was.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The New Testament clearly says that the Body is one with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not have the Head, we cannot have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without the Head, you would have something similar to the Body, but it would not be the Body it would be a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we claim to be the Body, then we must ask where the Head is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In our church life, do we have the Head?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Head certainly must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In our church life do we truly realize that Christ is here as the Head?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many who claim to be the Body, but who do not have the Head, are like a corpse that is somehow still active a body without a head still acting as if it were alive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a monstrosity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If someone were walking around in the meeting without a head, we would all be terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the situation in today s Christianity is that of many active bodies without the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Are we truly under the headship of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do have the awareness and the application of the headship of Christ among us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many times the brothers are unable to do certain things because of their awareness of Christ s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They realize that only Christ, not any of them, is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We dare not make certain decisions because we realize that only He is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must honor Christ s headship and apply it to the practicality of today s church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the Head is removed, the Body is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But when we have the Head, we have the Body also.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The church as the Body implies life and function.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Body is a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If it does not have life in it, it can no longer be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Without life, it would either be a corpse or an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A body must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A body also implies function.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, the Body of Christ has three things the Head, the life, and the function.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>My body functions even when I am sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A dead body, however, does not function at all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we say that we are the church, then we must realize three things concerning the Body: headship, life, and function.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I hope that you all will take in this word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although we may have the life of the Body, we may not live by that life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The human body has a life, and it certainly lives by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the body does not live by the life in the body, then it must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>For the body to be sick means that a part of the body does not live by the life of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Many Christians are talking about the church as the Body, but they are sick, not living by the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To say that we are the church, the Body of Christ, means that we live by the life of the Body, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Suppose you go to a brother to have some fellowship with him or to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As you do so, you must realize that you are in the Body and that you must live by the life in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You should not fellowship with that brother or deal with him by your own natural life, but by the life in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Perhaps not many among us have the full realization of this.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We need to realize that we must live and act by the life within the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is not for us to be holy, victorious, or spiritual; it is for us to be a part of the church, a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whenever we consider the matter of the functions in the Body, our heart aches.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>So many have been drugged and damaged by the tradition, background, and environment of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When they come to the meetings, they sit there under the influence of Christianity, expecting some hired ones to function for them.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Although this is the practice in Christianity, it is not the church in function.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In the church, every member functions.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>As I am speaking, my whole body is functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If my diaphragm did not function, I would not be able to project my voice very far.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If my legs did not function, my whole body would sense it and suffer because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But many members sit in the meetings without functioning and even without any inner sense regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This proves that they have been drugged by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In our meetings, everyone must function.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>No matter how many come together, even if it be more than a thousand, everyone must function.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Even if you do not bear a large responsibility in the Body, you still must function.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If we are sincere in saying that we are the church, then we all must function as members of the Body.</S>
