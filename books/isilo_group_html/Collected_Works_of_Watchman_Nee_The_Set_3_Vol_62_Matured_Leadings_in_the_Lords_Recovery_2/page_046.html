In order for God to have a way through the church, His children must recognize the authority of the Holy Spirit. Whether or not a man knows the authority of the Holy Spirit depends on his spiritual consciousness. If he is lacking in spiritual consciousness, he will not know anything about the authority of the Holy Spirit. Even if he speaks and acts in the most sincere way, he cannot be truly spiritual. Something may appear spiritual outwardly but not be so in reality. We must learn to discern this matter clearly. We can see men as trees, and we can see a piano as an organ. However, no tree can walk, and no organ will play like a piano.</p><p>If we are lacking in spiritual consciousness, we will never be submissive in our heart. Many people believe too much in their own eyes. They do not see, but they think that they have seen clearly. They cherish their own subjectivity. It is hard to say the same thing twice to such a person. If none of the responsible brothers and sisters have any spiritual discernment and if they merely coordinate by assigning works to the different groups, they may think that they have a spiritual consciousness and that they are sincere in their coordination, but in reality they are in big trouble. Today both Brother Witness and I have the same feeling that there is a lack of spiritual consciousness among the brothers and sisters. I hope that all the brothers and sisters will learn to touch their spirit's feeling. They should learn to know what spiritual consciousness is. We can explain red to a blind man all we want, but he will still not understand it. Even if the entire population of Russia explains red to a blind man, he still would not know it because he has never seen it. There are certain laws in the spiritual pathways. The operation of the Holy Spirit can only be realized by those with spiritual consciousness. This is like saying that the Bible is God's breathing. But the entire Bible can also become letter and form. Once spiritual consciousness is absent, the Bible becomes letter and form.</p><h2 class="head1">DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SPIRIT AND THE LETTER</h2><p>What is spirit, and what is the letter? What is the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the knowledge derived from the mind or from one's judgment? In the Bible the letter is not a good thing. The letter that Paul refers to in 2 Corinthians is the Old Testament Scripture. Although the Old Testament is part of the Bible, it is nothing but letter if one does not touch it in spirit. Something as good as the Bible can become letter. For something to be letter means that it was worked on by the Holy Spirit once, but the Spirit is no longer present when applied again. This makes it letter. For example, yesterday Brother Lee read two verses from the book of Romans. You might have felt the voice of the Holy Spirit in that reading. But when you explain the same verse to another person, it is not under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and it becomes nothing but letter.</p><p>A man can be in the book of Romans every day of the year. He can understand all the objective truths, but he cannot tell you when the Holy Spirit speaks or moves in him. To him, the book of Romans is the letter. He may wake up early every morning to read the Bible. He may set aside time every day to pray. But if these are merely rituals, he possesses nothing but the letter. Although outwardly the spiritual shell is still present, inwardly nothing of the spirit is present. This is the letter. We must have a consciousness of the spirit within before we can release something of the spirit. Only then will our words not be the letter. Suppose Brother Lee read Romans 2:18-19 on the Lord's Day afternoon. There might have been the spirit within Brother Lee, but there was not the consciousness of the spirit within me. I listened with my mind. As a result, I only received the letter. If I want to touch the spirit, I must have the spirit myself. Brother Lee had the spirit and the word. When I listened, I had to have the spirit and the word as well. Only spiritual organs can realize spiritual things. The objective letter that Brother Lee read, when mingled with the spirit, became God's word. Subjectively, I have to understand his word with my mind, but I must also touch the spirit behind Brother Lee's word with my spirit. If I do not touch the spirit behind the word, his word will only be letter to me. Hence, this has nothing to do with whether or not a man's mind understands. It is a matter of whether or not we are touching the Spirit with our spirit. We may expound God's word clearly, and others may understand it perfectly. But if we do not touch the spirit of God's word with our spirit, we have merely the letter. If a doctor operates on a patient in the way of letter, the sick man may turn into a corpse. This is more true in the spiritual realm.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
