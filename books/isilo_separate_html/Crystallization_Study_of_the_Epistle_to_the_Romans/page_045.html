<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="5">
	<li>This compound Spirit, as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), carries out the dynamic salvation of God organically in regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation, as we have seen in the past messages. In all these aspects the all-inclusive Spirit, as the life-giving Spirit, gives, imparts, dispenses, and distributes the divine life into the believers. This becomes the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for the believers to live Christ and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:19-21) and to practice the church life as unveiled in the last five chapters of Romans concerning the Body of Christ and the local churches. This is evidenced by Romans 14:17, which says that the righteousness, peace, and joy of such an all-inclusive Spirit are the reality of the kingdom of God in the church life.</li>
	<li>Such an all-inclusive Spirit, as the Spirit of life, becomes the seven Spirits of God in the dark age of the church in its degradation. The seven Spirits of God are the one Spirit in His sevenfold intensification. The sevenfold Spirit is to make the faithful followers of Jesus Christ the overcomers to overcome the legality of Judaism, the apostasy of Catholicism, the deadness of Protestantism, and the lukewarmness of the Brethren that they may close the present age of the church (Rev. 2&mdash;3).</li>
	<li>This processed Spirit eventually becomes the realization of Christ, the application of the pneumatized Christ, the pneumatic Christ in the believers&rsquo; experience of Him, and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God as the reality of the divine resurrection of Christ in God&rsquo;s new creation.</li>
	<li>This processed all-inclusive Spirit, as the processed and consummated Triune God, marries the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man, and they send a proclamation, as the proclamation of the consummated Triune God with His bride, the church, to the ones who are thirsty for the water of life (Rev. 22:17). The two become a universal couple to be the union of God and man, a mutual habitation of God and man, and the expression of the mingling of God and man in its expansion as the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</li>
	<li>The Nicene Creed is fundamental, but not complete. It does not cover:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;The Spirit was not yet&rdquo; (John 7:39).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit,&rdquo; the transforming Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18).</li>
		<li>The compound Spirit compounded with Christ&rsquo;s divinity and His humanity and with His sweet death, the sweet effectiveness of His death, and His all-conquering resurrection with its repelling power (Exo. 30:23-28).</li>
		<li>The sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</li>
		</ol></li>

<p>In this message we want to see more concerning the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). <em>The Spirit of life</em> is a particular, extraordinary title given to the Spirit of God in the New Testament economy. In the Old Testament economy, the Spirit of God was just the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah. But in the New Testament economy, the Spirit of God has become much more.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
