When as a young Christian I read this chapter, I thought that the woman&rsquo;s love for the Savior was the cause of the forgiveness of her sins. I thought that He forgave her because she loved Him. This understanding is not correct.</p><p>In verse 50 the Lord said to the woman that her faith, not her love, had saved her. Furthermore, regarding the two debtors who were forgiven by the moneylender, the Lord asked, &ldquo;Which of them therefore will love him more?&rdquo; (v. 42). This indicates clearly that love is the issue of forgiveness. Concerning this, we need to pay attention to the word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; in verse 42. This word proves that love comes after forgiveness instead of preceding it.</p><p>What, then, is the cause of the forgiveness of sins? From verse 50 we see that the cause is faith. It was the woman&rsquo;s faith that saved her. Her sins were forgiven not because of her love but because of her faith. Therefore, faith comes before forgiveness, and love follows faith.</p><h2 class="head2">Love Coming out of Faith</h2><p>It is very important for us to see that forgiveness comes before love. We should not think that our love is the cause of the forgiveness of our sins. On the contrary, love is the issue, the outcome, of our faith. When we believe in the Lord, our faith becomes the cause of the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins. Then as a result of having our sins forgiven, we begin to love the Lord. Hence, love comes out of faith.</p><h2 class="head2">Love Issuing in Peace</h2><p>Love issues in peace. First we believe in the Lord Jesus, having faith in Him. Then we are forgiven of all our sins, and this brings in love for the Lord. As we love Him, this love issues in peace. We, then, may walk in peace. To walk in peace means to live in peace, to have a life of peace. When we walk in peace, we have our being in peace and live a peaceful life. This means that when we believe in the Lord, we love Him and live a life in peace. This is the Christian life.</p><p>In 7:36-50 we see faith, love, and peace. We have faith in the Lord, we have love toward Him, and we have peace in following Him. Because we have believed in Him, we have been forgiven of our sins, and now we love Him. This love issues in a life of peace. As those who love the Lord, we live, walk, and have our being in peace.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ATMOSPHERE OF AFFECTION</h2><p>The atmosphere in 7:36-50 is an atmosphere of affection. There is affection both on the side of the Man-Savior and on the side of the sinful woman. The Lord&rsquo;s affection is an aspect of His human virtues. Once again in His human virtues we can see His divine attributes. In particular, we see the attribute of divine authority to forgive a person&rsquo;s sins. According to verse 49, those who were reclining at the table with the Lord said among themselves, &ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&rdquo; This One is the very God, for He alone has the authority to forgive sins.</p><p>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s divine attributes are also shown in His giving peace to the forgiven sinner. Only God can give peace to a forgiven sinner. Are you able to give peace to others? It is not in our hand to give others peace. Peace is in the almighty hand of God. Only He can forgive sins and give peace. Therefore, the forgiving of sins and the giving of peace are two attributes of God. Here these attributes are expressed in the Savior&rsquo;s human virtues.</p><p>In 7:36-50 we see once again that the Man-Savior saves people in the highest standard of morality. According to the emphasis in the Gospel of Luke, the highest standard of morality is a matter of the human virtues of the Man-Savior expressing His divine attributes.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
