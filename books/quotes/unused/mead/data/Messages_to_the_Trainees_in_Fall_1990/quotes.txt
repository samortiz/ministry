[4]  the Experience of Christ as Life CHAPTER ONE DEALING WITH OUR PECULIARITY,
[5]  In this message we want to fellowship about the need to deal with our peculiarity, our self, and our soul.
[6]  At this point we need to consider what the Lord Jesus said in the Gospels concerning the soul and the self.
[7]  Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .
[8]  Since he could declare this, he could also say, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20a , and he could say, "We also should walk in newness of life" Rom 6:4 , in the realm of the newness of the divine life.
[9]  Question: When a brother's peculiarity comes out in a certain situation, is it right to speak to him to expose his peculiarity?
[10]  Answer: As long as we sense others' peculiarity, our sensing is also a peculiarity.
[11]  If we react in this situation, our reaction is in our self.
[12]  CHAPTER THREE EXPERIENCING CHRIST BY FAITH Scripture Reading: Eph 3:17; John 14:19
[13]  The experience of Christ as life revealed in the Bible is not easily understood.
[14]  Because God is so great and holy and we are so small and common, we may hold the concept that the experience of Christ as life must be something spectacular.
[15]  I would like to say again that the physical aspect is very evident and easily realized, but the spiritual aspect is altogether invisible and difficult to apprehend.
[16]  This is also true regarding our experience of Christ.
[17]  We have Christ in us, but none of us can say that we have physically seen Christ.
[18]  Ephesians 5:20 says that we need to give thanks at all times in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Colossians 3:17 says that we need to do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[19]  In Ephesians 5:20 Paul says, "Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father," and in Colossians 3:17 Paul says, "And in everything, whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
[20]  These verses indicate, first of all, that we have been put into a oneness with the Lord.
[21]  To do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus should always remind us that He is one with us, that we are in Him and He in us, that He lives in us, and that we should live in Him.
[22]  Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?
[23]  The Lord concludes His teaching on the mountain by reminding us that as His believers we have His name and that we may use His name.
[24]  Yet He warns us that in using His name, we must be regulated by the Word of God, by the will of God.
[25]  Question: Can you share more concerning how we do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus?
[26]  Answer: First, we always should be reminded that we are in the Lord.
[27]  If in deciding to do a certain thing, we realize that we do not have an adequate knowledge of the Word, we should check with other more mature saints as to whether or not we should do a certain thing.
[28]  Grace in 1 Corinthians 15 is the very resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit v. 45 to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection.
[29]  The very God who was the Word in the beginning, the God who became a man in the flesh, the Son of God given to His believers, the crucified One who took away sin and released the divine life, the resurrected One, is now the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.
[30]  What we have fellowshipped so far shows the line of the dispensing from God's side in the Gospel of John, but there is the subjective experience of the dispensing on our side.
[31]  Regeneration is the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit coming to touch our spirit, to bring the divine life into our spirit to regenerate our spirit.
[32]  When we call "O Lord Jesus," we are breathing the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as our breath.
[33]  The believers who are regenerated, who breathe in Christ, drink Christ, eat Christ, and grow with Christ become the bride of the Bridegroom, Christ 3:29 .
[34]  According to what is revealed in John 15, the bride of Christ, who is His Body, eventually becomes the organism of the processed and dispensed Triune God, to express such a Triune God in a corporate way, until it reaches its peak in expressing and manifesting the processed and dispensed Triune God, as what will be consummated in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.
[35]  We all have to realize that the real Christian life, the real life of the believers in Christ, is not an exchanged life but a mingled life.
[36]  In a previous message, we saw that the Son came in the Father's name John 5:43a and that the Son did things in the name of the Father John 10:25 .
[37]  The Bible says that the flesh, our body, lusts or fights against our spirit which is mingled with the divine Spirit Gal 5:17 .
[38]  The verses in the Scripture reading above span the entire Bible regarding the divine Spirit and the human spirit from the first chapter to the last chapter.
[39]  Revelation 1:4 says, "John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne."
[40]  After the Lord's ascension, the gospel was preached so that we could receive Christ as the life-giving Spirit and be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the consummation of the Triune God, the Spirit Matt 28:19 .
[41]  The New Testament speaks much about love, but we cannot love properly if we are not in our spirit.
[42]  When we remain in the spirit, we can love properly and will also be gentle, godly, and spiritual.
[43]  When we remain in our spirit, we have all the virtues.
[44]  When we are talking too much, we should simply be quiet and turn back to our spirit to meet with the divine Spirit in our human spirit and enjoy His presence, His anointing, and His supplying in every way.
[45]  CHAPTER EIGHT JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 6:17, 19; 3:16; 7:40b; 15:45b; 2:10-13
[46]  Many Christians today emphasize the importance of the Word of God, but they neglect the Spirit.
[47]  I referred him to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which says, "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[48]  In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul spoke definitely, saying, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit," and again in 3:16 he said, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
[49]  We may say that we walk according to spirit, but we need the assurance that within us there is a separate and definite part called the human spirit, which is indwelt by the Spirit of God.
[50]  By faith we know that the Bible is the Word of God, and by faith we know that we have been saved, regenerated, and forgiven by God.
[51]  The more we believe that Christ is in us and is making His home in us, the happier we are and the more living we are, but the less we believe, the deader we are.
[52]  If we say there is no God, then to us there will be no God, but if we say there is a God, then we will experience that there is a God.
[53]  CHAPTER NINE THE MINGLED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 1:9; Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:5; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18; Rom 8:4; Gal 5:16, 25; 2 Tim 4:22
[54]  Throughout the past centuries, the light concerning the mingled spirit has not been as clear as it is today.
[55]  The early church had the teaching concerning the mingling of God with man.
[56]  In dealing with the truth of the mingling of divinity with humanity, we must consider the mingling of the divine Spirit with our human spirit.
[57]  There is such a fact that the divine Spirit, who is God Himself, is mingled with our human spirit, and there is a clear record of this mingling in the New Testament.
[58]  The Bible, however, has much to say about the human spirit.
[59]  Ephesians 1:17 says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him."
[60]  "Spirit" here does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.
[61]  Ephesians 2:22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit," and 3:5 says that God's New Testament economy was "revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit."
[62]  To be proper Christians, we must know that the Lord Jesus today as the embodiment of the Triune God is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 indwelling our spirit and mingled with our spirit as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .
[63]  God Himself, Christ, and even we human beings are mysterious.
[64]  We must simply believe that God created us with a human spirit.
[65]  When we believed in Him, He entered into our spirit as the life-giving Spirit.
[66]  He may not have felt the Spirit, and he had no way to prove that he had the Spirit, but he thought he had the Spirit of God.
[67]  The Bible speaks about our relationship with the Spirit of God in a detailed way.
[68]  John 3:6b says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit"; Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God"; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."
[69]  Incarnation, death, resurrection, and regeneration are all clearly unveiled in the Gospel of John.
[70]  However, this Gospel goes on to show us that Christ gives us Himself as the living water John 4:10, 14 , that He is the bread of life, good for eating 6:35 , and that He has breathed Himself into us as the Holy Breath 20:22 .
[71]  Based upon the accumulation of the good deposit of the holy Word, we have to breathe, drink, and eat the Lord.
[72]  The more we practice this as the root hairs of our experience, the more we will have the dispensing of the divine Trinity.
[73]  As we remain in our spirit, we will call on the name of the Lord, pray, and praise the Lord, and the divine dispensing will constantly supply us with the riches of the divine Trinity.
[74]  CHAPTER ELEVEN BECOMING SPIRITUAL PERSONS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:32, 37; Rom 8:14
[75]  In order to live a proper Christian life, we must know the Spirit of God and our human spirit.
[76]  Romans 8:14 indicates that we should be led by the Spirit, but 1 Corinthians 14:32 indicates that the one who prophesies should direct his own spirit.
[77]  We have been created by God with a human spirit, and God wants us to do everything according to our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, but He does not want us to be spirits.
[78]  In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
[79]  We should live in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, and be spiritual in our whole being, including our mind, emotion, and will.
[80]  CHAPTER TWELVE NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:19
[81]  First Thessalonians 5:19 says, "Do not quench the Spirit."
[82]  We may be cold, but the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, within us is not cold or idle.
[83]  OF THE TRIUNE GOD WITHIN US Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23; 18:20; 28:20; John 14:17; Acts 9:31; Rom 8:14, 16; 9:1; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-5a
[84]  In His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and in His resurrection He resurrected us Eph 2:6 and regenerated us 1 Pet 1:3 .
[85]  The New Testament also tells us that Christ as the Spirit is now in us, and the Spirit who is in us is the very presence of the Triune God.
[86]  Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."
[87]  It is the presence of the Spirit as His leading that designates us as the sons of God.
[88]  Verse 16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God."
[89]  the God-ordained Way CHAPTER FOURTEEN LABORING AND STRUGGLING Scripture Reading: Col 1:27-29; 1 Cor 15:58 THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY ANNULLING
[90]  Although this is a common way in today's Christianity, this is not the way shown in the Bible.
[91]  In Colossians 1:28 Paul said, "Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ."
[92]  The God-ordained way is a way of labor, but the traditional way does not require labor.
[93]  We ourselves have to admit that we are greatly lacking in our practice of the God-ordained way.
[94]  The Lord has shown us the details of His ordained way, but we have not yet come up to His standard in our labor.
[95]  In order to practice the new way in a practical way, we must first budget our time.
[96]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN PRACTICING THE GROUP MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12; 2 Tim 2:2; 1 Tim 3:2
[97]  The matter of Christian service has been a big problem among Christians for many years.
[98]  I have mentioned many points concerning the group meetings, but few have put them into practice.
[99]  I have mentioned that we need to come to the group meetings in a living way, either by singing, praising, or praying.
[100]  The best way to carry out Paul's charge to Timothy of teaching others is by the regular group meetings.
[101]  If a church is large, a number of regular group meetings could be established.
[102]  The first factor of our Christian faith is the one Body for the corporate expression of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[103]  The seventh factor of our Christian faith is the one God and Father, who is overshadowing us, taking care of us, and is always with us.
[104]  With the Body of Christ, the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence.
[105]  As those who are in Him, we are under His overshadowing, under His care, and under His presence to enjoy the Son as our element with the Spirit as our essence.
[106]  The fourth base of the oneness of the church is the oneness the Lord prayed for.
[107]  Now we have seen the base of the oneness of the church in its four aspects: the seven factors of our Christian faith, the oneness of the Spirit, who is the essence of the Body, the oneness of the divine Trinity, and the oneness for which the Lord prayed, which is constituted with the Father's life, His word, and His glory.
[108]  In order for us to practice the oneness of the Body of Christ, we need to realize that division is heretical, sectarian Gal 5:20b-21a .
[109]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:18b-19; 2:9; 1:15b; Acts 2:33a; Eph 1:22b; Phil 2:9b; Col 1:18a; 1:12; 1 Cor 1:2b; Col 3:4a; Gal 2:20a; Phil 1:21a, 20b; Gal 4:19; Eph 4:15b; Col 2:19b; 1:28b; Eph 4:13b; Col 1:27; Eph 1:18b; 4:4b; John 8:12; 6:51, 57b; 1 Cor 10:4; John 20:22; Gal 3:27b; John 15:7a; Col 2:16-17; Matt 11:28; 1 Cor 1:24, 30; 12:12; 3:11; Eph 2:20; Col 3:11; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; John 21:15; Eph 4:12; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:3-5
[110]  In this message we will cover another crucial point in the practice of the Lord's recovery.
[111]  This point that we want to cover is the truth concerning Christ.
[112]  CHRIST TO THE BELIEVERS A. God's Allotted Portion to the Saints
[113]  Christ is the God-allotted portion to the saints.
[114]  Eventually, we have to grow to such an extent so that we can be presented to God full-grown in Christ Col 1:28b; Eph 4:13b .
[115]  Christ is also our dwelling place, our abode John 15:7a .
[116]  Furthermore, as our subjective righteousness, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God.
[117]  If we live Christ, letting Christ live in us, then we live in Him, and we are Christ.
[118]  Section V General Messages CHAPTER NINETEEN GOD'S ECONOMY AND DISPENSING
[119]  In order for God to attain His plan and purpose, a process is needed.
[120]  From God's side, He gives us the Spirit not by measure; on our side, we receive the dispensing of the Holy Spirit in full that we may be inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit.
[121]  Through the divine dispensing, we are filled with the Holy Spirit to become the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ, the church, the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23; 3:19 .
[122]  The Gospel of John is a book on God's dispensing.
[123]  Every time we eat, drink, and breathe the Lord, we absorb the Lord as food, drink, and air into us.
[124]  As we are eating the Lord, drinking the Lord, and growing, we are abiding in Him and He in us.
[125]  When we baptize people into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, we baptize them into all that the Triune God is, so that they may share in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[126]  The enlarged Christ Christ Himself and all those who believe in Him is the vine tree in John 15, which is the organism of the Triune God in His divine economy to be God's corporate expression in the universe for eternity.
[127]  Hymn #1 Hymns is very simple and short but deep in its thought concerning God's purpose:
[128]  Today we have two great gifts, God's written Word and God Himself as the life-giving, indwelling Spirit.
[129]  In our hands, we have the written Word; in our spirit, we have the Spirit Rom 8:16; John 4:24; 1 Cor 6:17 .
