The evil spirits will be released to stir up the people from the Far East, who will come with their horsemen in the number of two hundred million. They will come from the Far East, passing through the Euphrates River to Armageddon. Armageddon is very close to Jerusalem, where the Antichrist and his armies will be. These armies will be killed at Armageddon by fire and smoke and sulphur. In principle these are the same as a modern nuclear bombing. Remember that these are not the armies under the Antichrist, but the armies from the East who have passed through the river Euphrates. These armies from the East will first come to the area of the Euphrates River, today's Iraq and Iran; then they will come to Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Winepress</H2><P>While the Antichrist will be attacking Jerusalem, the two hundred million horsemen from the East will also come to Jerusalem. This means that the armies of the earth will be gathered together at one time just like grapes from the vineyard are gathered into the winepress. Then the Lord Jesus will come to tread the winepress. By His treading the winepress, the Lord Jesus will destroy the armies of the Antichrist and the two hundred million cavalrymen from the Far East.</P><P>According to Revelation 17:12-14, the ten horns, representing the ten kings, will suddenly receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast, the Antichrist. These will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb shall overcome them. Those with Him, His armies, will be those who are chosen and faithful. Who are the chosen and faithful ones? Remember the Lord's words: "Many are called but few are chosen" (Matt. 22:14). The chosen ones are those faithful to the Lord who will become His army.</P><P>According to Revelation 19, His armies will be dressed in fine linen, white and pure. The fine linen garment is the garment for the marriage feast and is also the fighting garment. The marriage garment will be the fighting garment. The Lord will tread the winepress and prepare a feast for all the birds in the heavens. When the wicked one appears, the Lord will destroy him with a sharp sword out of His mouth. Thus, all the verses in the Old Testament and the New Testament are very consistent. The Lord Jesus will come to destroy all the rebellious armies by the breath out of His mouth. This is why the blood will be so deep (Rev. 14:20).</P><P>Then according to Revelation 11:15, the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ. The Gentile armies will be destroyed, and the whole image representing the Gentile age will be smashed.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_202.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_204.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kingdom &nbsp; pg 203</div><br></body></html>
