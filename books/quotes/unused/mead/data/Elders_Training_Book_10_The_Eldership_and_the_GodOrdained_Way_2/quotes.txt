[3]  IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 13:19; Acts 20:30; Eph 4:14 OUTLINE The present turmoil in the Lord's recovery: Instigated by the evil one Matt 13:19.
[4]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your mercy and for the blessing under Your mercy.
[5]  Lord, we thank You for Your abundant grace, which is so sufficient for us.
[6]  Now I would like to point out to you the turmoils among the children of God in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[7]  One among the disciples selected by the Lord Jesus was Judas, who also became a betrayer v. 16 . During the Apostle Paul's lifetime, the church life passed through turmoils that were full of problems.
[8]  The present turmoil among us can be considered a rebellion, a rebellion with a conspiracy.
[9]  Any saint who knows the New Testament teachings logically and reasonably and who is faithful to the Lord according to His holy and unchanging Word would not care for the unbridled speakings in the present turmoil.
[10]  The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery is through the proper and common fellowship of the Body.
[11]  The way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery should also be according to the Scriptures without twisting and without any interpretation out of context, without any mixing in of human ideas, without any element of tradition, but with an open and seeking spirit.
[12]  We can see the difference in capacity with Barnabas and Paul in Acts.
[13]  Barnabas was used by the Lord to bring Saul, who became Paul, into the ministry Acts 9:26-27; 11:22-26 .
[14]  THE LORD'S MOVE TODAY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12; Matt 16:18; Rev 5:6b; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Acts 5:42; John 21:15; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-26, 31; John 15:1, 5, 8a; Eph 3:19; John 3:29-30; Rev 19:7-8; 22:17; 21:1-2, 9b-10; Luke 19:12, 15a; Dan 2:34-35, 44-45; Rev 11:15 OUTLINE Our God is living 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12.
[15]  Since October 1984, I have been burdened to study the need in the Lord's recovery according to the situation that was present among us at that time.
[16]  Thank the Lord that He has given me the environment, the time, the energy, and everything that was needed for me to remain in that study for these five years.
[17]  And I thank Him even more that through this long period of study the Lord has shown me the God-ordained way to serve and work for Him, as revealed in the New Testament.
[18]  To tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, is to preach the gospel, telling people how God has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light through His virtues, such as His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, His washing away of our sins, His justification, and His regeneration.
[19]  2 To recover the home meetings for feeding the new believers.
[20]  In John 21:15 the Lord Jesus charged Peter to feed His lambs, the new believers.
[21]  After we have brought some to the Lord and have baptized them into the Triune God, we should go back as a nursing mother 1 Thes 2:7 to feed them in their homes continually for a period of a few months.
[22]  1 To build up the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and dispensing God in His divine Trinity for His full expression.
[23]  The direction of the Lord's move today is, first, to build up His organic Body Eph 4:12 , a Body full of Himself and built up with Himself Col 3:11 as the life-giving Spirit, who is the essence, the element, and the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ Eph 4:4a .
[24]  Such a Body becomes the organism of the processed Triune God John 15:1, 5, 8a , who is dispensing Himself in His divine Trinity 2 Cor 13:14 to saturate the Body of Christ organically that it might be His full expression in the universe Eph 3:19 .
[25]  The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into His believers in the church age Luke 17:21; Mark 4:3, 8, 26 and spreading in His increasing John 3:30 to be the enlarged, upcoming kingdom of God, which He will bring in at His coming back Luke 19:12, 15a; Rev 11:15 .
[26]  Both God and Christ are aspiring to see the Body of Christ built up, to see the bride prepared, and to see the kingdom brought in, that Christ may have a Body, that Christ may have His bride, and that God may have a kingdom on this earth for His eternal economy.
[27]  CHAPTER THREE THE GENUINE ONENESS OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: John 17:2, 6, 11, 14-21, 22-24; Eph 4:1-6, 11-16
[28]  Prayer: Thank You, Father, that we have Your name.
[29]  In the last chapter of that book, there is a promise from God to the local churches, that is, that God will crush Satan under the feet of the local churches v. 20 . We need to stand on this promise and believe that our God, the God of peace, will surely crush Satan under our feet.
[30]  One of the most positive items in the New Testament revelation is the genuine oneness of the Body.
[31]  The oneness of the Body is the oneness of all the believers in Christ in the Father's name John 17:2, 6, 11 .
[32]  Before being saved, we were in the world and were mixed with the world.
[33]  To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world.
[34]  This oneness is to express in His fullness the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God, who has mingled Himself with the believers in their humanity.
[35]  This oneness is composed of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God as its four factors vv.
[36]  When we say that Christ is all-inclusive, we mean that He is not only the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit but also the Man; that within Him is His marvelous death and His powerful resurrection; and that He is all that we need salvation, peace, hope, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our spiritual home.
[37]  We all need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding the truth in love and being built up in the organic Body of Christ by each one part, that is, each member, functioning in its measure Eph 4:15-16 .
[38]  IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; Matt 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil 1:27; 1 Cor 1:10; Rev 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; Col 4:16; 1 Cor 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes 2:14; 1 Cor 1:11-13; Phil 1:15, 17 THE ONE ACCORD
[39]  In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, "One church and one Spirit..."; rather, he said, "One Body and one Spirit..."
[40]  To say "Amen" in response to others' prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians.
[41]  In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say "Amen."
[42]  If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard.
[43]  The oneness that we possess in all the churches is not merely the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer.
[44]  When we practice the proper one accord, we must realize the attributes of the church as the unique Body of Christ.
[45]  The New Testament reveals that not only all the saints but even all the churches must be in one accord.
[46]  The seven churches were the same normally in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ.
[47]  These positive things include: in Ephesus, labor, endurance, and the hating of the works of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:2-3, 6 ; in Smyrna, the suffering of tribulation, poverty, and trial, and being faithful 2:9-10 ; in Pergamos, holding fast the Lord's name and not denying the faith of the Lord 2:13 ; in Thyatira, love, faith, service, and endurance 2:19 ; in Sardis, not defiling their garments 3:4 ; and in Philadelphia, keeping the word of the Lord and not denying His name 3:8, 10 .
[48]  These negative things include: in Ephesus, some calling themselves apostles and not being such, and the church leaving its first love Rev 2:1a, 2, 4 ; in Pergamos, the church settling in the world, some holding the teaching of Balaam, and some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans 2:12a, 13-15 ; in Thyatira, the church tolerating the woman Jezebel to teach and lead the Lord's slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices 2:18a, 20 ; in Sardis, the church having a name that it was living but it was dead, and its works not being found by Christ completed before God 3:1-2 ; and in Laodicea, the church being neither cold nor hot, but boasting, "I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing" 3:14-15, 17 .
[49]  In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently.
[50]  This does not mean that in the matter of teaching all the churches should give the same messages and use the same books, even at the same time; it means that all the churches should not teach things that are different from the New Testament revelation of God's New Testament economy.
[51]  We must consider that all these points came sovereignly into existence that we may be one in all things related to God, Christ, and the church, that we may spontaneously be exercised to practice the one accord according to all the attributes of oneness in the divine and spiritual interests.
[52]  Using teachings such as the teaching concerning the headship of Christ, the teaching concerning all the churches being responsible directly to Christ alone, and the teaching concerning not exalting man, all of which seem very scriptural, as reasons for separation from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned.
[53]  The Catholic Church's organization, with the pope as its head and with the bishops in different ranks as subordinates, is a hierarchy, which is not scriptural and is condemned by the Lord.
[54]  CHAPTER FIVE THE TESTS OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY
[55]  In this chapter we will consider all the tests in the New Testament of the genuine oneness of the Body and of the proper one accord in the church.
[56]  I. THE TEST OF THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE ACTS 6:1-6
[57]  The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language.
[58]  THE TEST OF A BROTHER HAVING A CASE AGAINST
[59]  To take care of this case of heresy, we need the experience of abiding in the Lord according to His anointing, and we should charge the believers not to listen to the heretical teaching, but to take care of the inner anointing.
[60]  Jude exhorted the believers also to build up themselves in their most holy faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and keep themselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life v. 20 . This shows that in such a situation of apostasy, the best way for us is to exhort the believers in the positive way that Jude did.
[61]  To deal with such a complicated case as the case of the church in Pergamos being one with the world and some of its members holding the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans requires us to be one with the Lord in standing against the world as the satanic system of darkness, and requires us to hate idolatry, spiritual fornication, and the sin of hierarchy the evil system of organization in religion.
[62]  Hence, the loving and merciful Lord counsels such a church to buy, to obtain at a cost from Him, refined gold the tested faith for partaking of the divine nature , white garments the conduct approvable to the Lord , and anointing eye salve the anointing Spirit, the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit as their remedies v. 18 .
[63]  Among the fifty-one cases listed above, thirty-five, the majority, are of different kinds and were all except case IV taken care of positively by various adequate ways, such as the proper arrangement of the service in case I, testifying according to the truth in case II, and recovering in a spirit of meekness a brother overtaken in an offense in case XVIII, leaving only sixteen, the minority, to be taken care of in the way of quarantine.
[64]  This indicates that, according to His loving concern over His dear redeemed saints, the Lord's intention concerning all the believers who are involved in the tests of the oneness of His Body and of the one accord of His church is to adjust, correct, rescue, recover, and perfect them so that He can carry out the building up of His organic Body.
[65]  In case XXXVIII, the Apostle John sharply and emphatically charged us not to receive into our house a heretic who does not confess Christ's coming in the flesh but goes beyond the teaching of Christ, and even not to greet him, that we may not share in his evil works 2 John 7, 9-11 .
[66]  Concerning case VIII, a case of gross sin, the Apostle Paul took care of it first by judging the sinning one in the name of the Lord and delivering him to Satan for destruction of the flesh 1 Cor 5:3-5 , and then by solemnly charging the saints to exercise to quarantine the sinning one by not eating with him and removing him from the fellowship in the church 1 Cor 5:11, 13 .
[67]  Among all the tests of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord of the church listed above, only three divisions, heresies, and fornication are intolerable and need a quarantine by the churches and the saints according to the apostles' teaching.
[68]  Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ.
[69]  Thus, divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work.
[70]  If these three things are taking place in the church, the Body of Christ would be annulled, the very Christ would be altogether damaged, and the humanity used as the constituents of the Body of Christ would be fully corrupted.
[71]  Concerning the three problems of division, heresy, and gross sin, we need to be very careful in dealing with those involved, in order that the building up of the Body of Christ may proceed in a proper way, not allowing the Body of Christ to be damaged by divisions, Christ to be damaged by heresies, and the humanity that is for the Lord's Body to be damaged by gross sins.
[72]  IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15; 2 John 1-2; 3 John 3-4; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor 5:2, 11-13; 11:19; 4:1-5; 2 Cor 5:10
[73]  Whatever we do preaching the gospel to save the sinners, feeding the new believers that they may grow, perfecting the saints that they may do the work that the gifted persons can do to build up the Body of Christ, teaching the word and expounding the Bible that the saints may be edified both in the truth and life, training the saints that they may be built up in the Lord's service and work, and even establishing the ministry or the work itself is for the building up of the churches.
[74]  In such a practice as ours, we also stress that all the churches with all the saints should cooperate and be one with the ministry, so that the ministry will be strengthened and be more effective, that the churches with all the saints may benefit more in the ultimate goal for the Lord's interest, that is, to have His organic Body fully built up.
[75]  The letter John referred to in this accusation is related to the one accord which I spoke about to the elders in February 1986.
[76]  In principle, according to the Lord's prayer in John 17 that all His believers would be one, the Lord is always pleased when we, the believers, are one in the things that are for His interest, and the Lord is surely offended if in anything that is for His interest we would not be one.
[77]  We do emphasize that all the churches should be one in the Body of Christ, not by the way of forming a federation but in the way of adequate fellowship in the Spirit in the organic union of the divine life.
[78]  In this point John condemns "a pervasive control exercised over the church."
[79]  Is there among us such "a pervasive control exercised over the church," that is, a control that pervades all the churches?
[80]  Our training is to train mainly the young saints to grow in the divine life and in the divine truth, to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, to feed the lambs of the Lord, to perfect the saints, and to build up the organic Body of Christ.
[81]  For keeping such a oneness according to the heart's desire of the Lord and according to the attributes of oneness that characterize the Body of Christ with the elements of the divine Trinity Eph 4:3-6 , there is the need of the proper leadership of the elders in the church life and the genuine leadership of the ministers in the Lord's ministry.
[82]  Thank the Lord that, by His grace, the ministry that He has given me has been greatly blessed by Him in the past years.
[83]  John said that "our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him Witness Lee ."
[84]  A servant of the Lord who ministers the word of God to the saints is very much related to the saints, and the saints are very much related to him.
[85]  And "in our reception of other saints" we are absolutely not narrow; rather, we are as broad as the Lord is in this matter, because we receive, as the Lord and God do Rom 14:3; 15:7 , every kind of genuine Christian who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[86]  In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus showed us clearly in His parables the difference between the wheat the real Christians and the tares the nominal Christians , the difference between meal fine flour Christ as food to God and men and leaven evil things such as heresies, false teachings, and evil practices , the difference between the mustard seed Christ as the seed of life and a big tree the abnormal development of the church Christianity , and the difference between the tares, leaven, and the abnormally developed tree, and the treasure hidden in the field the kingdom of the heavens and the pearl of great value the genuine church .
[87]  John's word here is an accusation against the teaching of deputy authority in the Lord's recovery.
[88]  According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is deputy authority in God's economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church 1 Tim 3:5; 5:17; Heb 13:17 , and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints 2 Cor 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor 4:21 .
[89]  When he is seeking the leading directly from the Lord, he should also take care of the elders in the local church, because he is living and working in the church as a part of the Body.
[90]  When the churches are seeking the leading directly from the Lord, they should also take care of the apostles, because they are all living and working with the apostles in the churches as the Body of Christ.
[91]  Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body.
[92]  If it is due to the saints' independence, then the saints need to learn how to live the Body life; if it is due to the saints' unwillingness to be one with the elders, then they need to learn more concerning how to be in one accord with the elders in the church life; if they are holding a different view than the church's view, then they need to learn more lessons that they may go along with the church or the churches in the Lord's recovery.
[93]  Regardless of what the fear is due to, it is always better to obey the elders in a church or the apostles among the churches at the same time as one obeys the Lord, rather than to obey only the Lord without caring for the elders in the church or the apostles among the churches.
[94]  In 2 John 1-2 and in 3 John 3-4, the aged Apostle John was happy to know that his children kept the truth.
[95]  Today we need to have a complete, thorough knowledge concerning the fellowship of the Body of Christ, and also concerning the fellowship of the local churches.
[96]  As we have seen in this book, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning eight basic and major items: God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the believers, the church, the proper ground of the church, and the practice of the local churches.
[97]  We need to see in a brief way the fellowship of the Body of Christ.
[98]  Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ.
[99]  We always need to remember that we are in the Lord's recovery and that His recovery is unique.
[100]  Some brothers may be afraid for others to come and visit them.
[101]  But what we need today among the churches is more divine circulation, more fellowship.
[102]  There are about fifty churches in California, but there is not much fellowship among them.
[103]  The Body of Christ as the church, the unique universal church, is expressed through the local churches.
[104]  The local churches, which are the expressions of the unique Body of Christ, are scattered on this earth in the localities where the local churches exist to express the Body of Christ.
[105]  Every local church should receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ Rom 14:1-6; 15:1-7 .
[106]  The second thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of the church is being heretical, denying that Christ came in the flesh 2 John 7-11 .
[107]  The title "the church of God" denotes not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church must have the nature of God.
[108]  The genuine oneness of the Body of Christ must be practiced with the unique ground of locality within the limit of the boundary and jurisdiction of the locality in which a church exists, that is, on the ground of locality, as with the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church in Antioch Acts 13:1 , the church in Cenchrea Rom 16:1 , the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , and the seven churches in the seven cities in Asia Rev 1:11 .
[109]  THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION SECT Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42
[110]  THE DISCERNING OF THE ONE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:29-30; 10:17; Eph 4:4
[111]  Suppose, however, that we have a group of believers who originally were meeting with the church, but because of certain reasons, they left the church and keep themselves separate from the church, without having any fellowship with the church.
[112]  Every group of four of the leading ones and the leading seeking ones should bring the two or three who are under their care together to practice the group meeting to learn how to fellowship with one another, how to pray for one another, how to care for one another, how to shepherd one another, and how to teach one another by mutual questions and mutual answers, that they all may be perfected to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .
[113]  We should take the tutoring and coaching way to train all the ones under our care to prophesy first in the group meetings as an exercise and then in the church meetings as a practice.
[114]  Eventually, nearly all the ones under our care will be able to prophesy.
[115]  I would like to present a simple way to bear fruit.
[116]  Whether or not this can be worked out depends upon our endeavoring.
[117]  I would especially like to talk to the elders among us who are full-time.
[118]  Among the saints, you have to be the examples, the living ones who get three to five people saved every six months.
[119]  We have to change our concept concerning having a preacher with a preaching meeting.
[120]  We ourselves need to labor directly to bring one or two into the church life yearly.
[121]  We love the church, but we may not have brought one person into the church in the past five years.
[122]  Eventually Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . The Lord Jesus responded to Peter by telling him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" v. 17 . The Lord was asking the disciples who He was, but eventually what came out was a revelation concerning Christ being the rock.
[123]  The Body of Christ is not directly covered in the four Gospels.
[124]  Of course, in the Gospel of John the church is revealed as the Father's house in chapter fourteen.
[125]  The Lord said that in His Father's house there are many abodes v. 2 . The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ Rom 12:5 , which is God's temple 1 Cor 3:16-17 . This is adequately proven by John 14:23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him.
[126]  The apostles' teaching includes two main and crucial items.
[127]  Ephesians 4 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father vv.
[128]  We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity.
[129]  Eventually, the elders among us nearly replaced the saints.
[130]  Now I would like to say a word of love, advice, and warning.
[131]  We should not think that we will abandon the churches which are in the old way.
