   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE SEPARATION AND MOVEMENTS OF THE APOSTLES ANTIOCH THE MODEL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church in Antioch is the model church shown us in God's Word, because it was the first to come into being after the founding of the churches connected with the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 2 we see the church in connection with the Jews established in Jerusalem, and in chapter ten we see the church in connection with the Gentiles established in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was just after the establishment of these churches that the church in Antioch was founded.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In its transition stage the church in Jerusalem was not altogether free from Judaism, but the church in Antioch from the very outset stood on absolutely clear Church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is of no little significance that "the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch" Acts 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was there that the peculiar characteristics of the Christian and the Christian Church were first clearly manifested, for which reason it may be regarded as the pattern church for this dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its prophets and teachers were model prophets and teachers, and the apostles it sent forth were model apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only are the men sent forth an example to us, but the manner of their sending forth is our example too.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the first recorded sending out of apostles by the Holy Spirit was from Antioch, we shall do well to look carefully into its details.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the completion of the New Testament the Holy Spirit has called many of God's children to serve Him throughout the world, but, strictly speaking, none of these can be regarded as our examples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must always look at the first act of the Holy Spirit in any given direction to discover His pattern for us in that particular direction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in order to see what example the Church must follow today in the sending forth of apostles, let us examine carefully the first recorded sending forth of workers from the first church established on absolutely clear Church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE HOLY SPIRIT'S CALL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first two verses of Acts 13 we read, "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us note a few facts here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was a local church in Antioch, there were certain prophets and teachers who were ministers in that church, and it was from among those that the Holy Spirit separated two for another sphere of service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Barnabas and Saul were two ministers of the Lord already engaged in the ministry when the call of the Spirit came.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit only sends to other parts such as are already equipped for the work and are bearing responsibility where they are, not those who are burying their talents and neglecting local needs while they dream of some future day when the call will come to special service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Barnabas and Saul were bearing the burden of the local situation when the Spirit put the burden of other parts upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their hands were full of local work when He thrust them out to work further afield.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us note first that the Holy Spirit chooses apostles from among the prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These prophets and teachers ministered so wholeheartedly to the Lord that when occasion demanded they even ignored the legitimate claims of their physical being and fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What filled the thoughts of those prophets and teachers at Antioch was ministry to the Lord, not work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their devotion was to the Lord Himself, not to His service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one can truly work for the Lord who has not first learned to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was while Barnabas and Saul ministered to the Lord that the voice of the Spirit was heard calling them to special service.</S>
