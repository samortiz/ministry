   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ISSUE NO.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>9 P. O. Box 84, Hankow, July 1938 NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK From Tibet to Sikang,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At present Brother Hsu and I are still conducting evangelistic work around Yeh-Ji.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since January of this year, both rain and snow have been heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even birds have disappeared from the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The route through which we will travel into Sikang and Tibet is blocked, and trade caravans have been halted due to the rebellion of the Yi tribesmen in Deh-Chin County.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Deh-Chin is also called Ah-Dun-Chi; it is a five-day journey from Yeh-Ji in the northernmost county of Yunnan province, with a population consisting entirely of Sikang natives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We dare not advance now because preparations are not fully ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The upper tributary of the Nu River goes through the west side of Yeh-Ji, climbing over the mountain to Gung-Shan County.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was an area where I did some evangelistic work last year, with over a thousand people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one travels upstream along the Nu River for five or six days, he will come to Cha-Wa-Rung, which is under Tibetan jurisdiction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I estimate that we will not be able to cross the snowy mountain ranges until the fifth month of the Chinese calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Hsu and I intend to take this route to enter Tibet first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From there, we will travel to Sikang.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our departure is getting nearer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Presently, my family is at peace through the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The construction of the house will soon be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If other brothers come and visit us, we will have a place to lodge them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hu Yi-min and wife, Yang Shu-jen</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May 9 in Yeh-Ji</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Letter from Brother Hsu Jung-jieh,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It would be wonderful if Brother Chang Tze-jieh could come and work together with us here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that he can come soon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have written him a letter but have not received his reply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am making some progress in learning the Tibetan language.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the time I go with Brother Hu to preach the gospel in Sikang, I believe this labor will reap a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My wife and two children are often sick because of maladjustment to the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may have to go to K'un-ming, or they may go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I look to the Lord for His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I go with Brother Hu on our evangelistic travel, it will take at least two or three months, or even half a year, before we can come back to see our family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, it will be more or less the same for them if they stay here or move to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hsu Jung-jieh and wife, Sien-yun</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May 9</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Experience of Pioneering</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>in the Border Regions, Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Chen Hsi-wen and I left Shi-Ping on May 2, arriving in Mong-Tze on the third.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We conducted outdoor evangelistic work for half a day on the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A shopkeeper, coolie, and railway worker were particularly touched to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the afternoon of the fourth, we traveled from Mong-Tze to Bi-Se-Zhai north of Mong-Tze at the junction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Route and the Ku-Bi-Shi Road .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We unexpectedly met Brother Yin and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Chou Hung-bao and Brother Lin Yau-huei's mother also arrived from Ho-Kou.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We took the train together and arrived in K'un-ming in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our travels, we found many difficulties in the pioneering work in the remote border regions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Except for the Lord's special grace, we would have had no way to start any work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some of the difficulties included:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1 Traveling: There is the danger of robbers and bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The train along Ku-Bi-Shi Road was raided not long ago, and quite a number of people died or were wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Entering into the inland regions is not only difficult but also time consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most of the brothers and sisters living in the villages are poor, and it is advisable to bring more cash when traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a constant threat of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, there is the need for faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>2 Preaching: Other than outdoor evangelistic preaching, it is difficult to gather a congregation because the folks here do not have the habit of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Most of the audience are farmers and illiterate people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They do not understand Mandarin easily.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as we use more sophisticated terms, they become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The meetings of the local church are not conducted on a punctual basis because most of the believers do not have watches or clocks.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are delays from one to two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is difficult to explain the deeper truths unless we find suitable, simple words or parables from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some think that it does not take any great gift to work in the villages or the inland regions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, it takes as much gift and power to preach to illiterate sinners as it does to preach to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to my experience, working in the villages is more difficult than working in the cities.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The co-workers who have been working in the cities should come to the rural areas to learn about rural life and to make friends with the rural folks.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, it will be very difficult to see any result.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This, of course, refers to the practical aspects of human affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>3 The church: Most people are illiterate, and it is difficult for them to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Most of the residents in the inland regions are also prejudiced against outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They often disrupt us using a variety of means.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>4 Outdoor evangelistic meetings: When we pioneered in different places, the Lord gave us the strength to have the boldness to engage ourselves in outdoor evangelistic preaching in the markets and populous places.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>According to our natural constitution, we are shy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people thought that we were native medicine men or street magicians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever we went out, we prayed for the Lord to give us the strength to speak His gospel boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We saw evidence of the Lord's grace every time, proving that the gospel has the power to save all those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We witnessed some immediately receiving the Lord every time.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The following are the advantages of outdoor preaching: 1 It enables sinners to hear the gospel who otherwise could not come or would not have the opportunity to come to the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It affords them a chance to hear and receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>2 Those who are moved can be quickly introduced to the meetings of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>3 It is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Any vacant land under the sky can serve as our preaching ground.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is no need for rent or seating.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>According to our experience, most people can stand for an hour without walking away.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can conduct these meetings any time and in any place; there is no limitation of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This time we prepared many gospel charts and short choruses.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As soon as we hung up the charts and sang the choruses, many sinners were attracted to us and listened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Trumpets, accordions, or bells are also good for attracting the crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Usually two or three of us take turns speaking, and the audience also rotates.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have started this kind of work in K'un-ming already.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The co-workers here had the first co-workers' meeting in my house on the eleventh of last month.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We encouraged and edified each other in the Lord, discussed matters related to the work, considered the problems, and gave ourselves to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have set aside every Wednesday afternoon at two o'clock for this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>K. H. Weigh</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>June 6 in K'un-ming</S>
