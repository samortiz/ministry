   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE READING THE BIBLE THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is not something that comes from man s ideas or thoughts; rather, the Bible contains the thoughts and words of God, which were breathed into men through His Spirit and then written down.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Bible is the word of God breathed out through His Spirit, the words in the Bible do not represent the ideas of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, they are words from God to men who were borne by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These men spoke while being borne by the Holy Spirit, just as a sailboat is blown, borne, and moves with the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who wrote the Bible were inspired by and under the power of the Holy Spirit; they were blown and borne by the Holy Spirit to express the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible did not come only from men nor does it express only the ideas of these men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, these men wrote the word that came out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Spoken to you by God Matt 22:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After referring to reading the word that was spoken to you by God in verse 31, the Lord Jesus quoted a verse from the Old Testament in verse 32.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord s word in verse 31, therefore, proves that the words of the Old Testament were spoken by God and originated from God, even though they were written by prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Old Testament is the word that God spoke in the prophets of old to the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Testament is the speaking of God in His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the words spoken by the prophets in the Old Testament and the words spoken by the Lord Jesus in the New Testament were spoken by God and were out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words of God John 8:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse the Lord Jesus clearly stated that the words He spoke were the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit...will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you John 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus spoke of leaving the disciples, He prophesied that the Holy Spirit would come to teach the disciples and cause them to remember that the things that He had said to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word indicates that the Holy Spirit descended and inspired the disciples to write the books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The books of the New Testament are of the Holy Spirit, and they have divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit...will declare John 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord s word in this verse indicates that the disciples spoke and wrote what the Spirit declared to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The books of the New Testament, which were written by the Lord s disciples after His ascension, come from the Holy Spirit s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is an acknowledgment of their divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible is the word that God commanded man to write Exo 34:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the speaking of the Spirit of God through men who were inspired by the Holy Spirit 2 Sam 23:2; Mark 12:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Old Testament is the word of God spoken by the prophets, according to His command Jer 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the word of God that the priests received Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1:3 , and it is the speaking of the Spirit of God through the prophets Zech 7:7; Acts 3:18; 28:25; Rom 1:2; 1 Pet 1:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The New Testament is the word spoken by God in the Lord Jesus John 14:10 and the word declared by the Holy Spirit and then written by the apostles 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The words of the Holy Spirit to the apostles have the same divine status as the words in the Old Testament 2 Pet 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the words in the entire Bible are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every word and sentence, iota and serif Matt 5:18 , were revealed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must neither add to the Bible nor take away anything from it Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Testify concerning Me John 5:39, see also v. 46; Luke 24:27, 44, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus is the subject and content of the Bible, and the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus is the living Word of God, whereas the Bible is the written Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the written Word, the Bible, did not have the living Word, the Lord Jesus, as its reality, it would be nothing but empty doctrines and letters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the living Word, the Lord Jesus, did not have the written Word, the Bible, as His expression, He would be abstract and vague and difficult to know and touch.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thankfully, we have the distinct and definite explanation of the Bible with its clear revelation so that we can know and understand the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The books of the New Testament reveal the Lord Jesus, and even the books of the Old Testament, including the law of Moses, the books of prophecies, and the psalms and poetry, reveal the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three general sections that comprise the Old Testament Luke 24:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must read and understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Make you wise unto salvation 2 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, the Bible serves the Lord Jesus by testifying concerning Him, and on the other hand, it serves us by causing us to be saved and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first function of the Bible in relation to us is to make us wise unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It reveals God s way of salvation in Christ and our pathway to salvation through faith so that we may know and understand God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Regenerated 1 Pet 1:23; see also James 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible causes us to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible is the word of the eternally living God, and it contains God s eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we receive the word of the Bible through faith, the word is planted like a seed of life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible functions to sow the life of God into us, imparting God s life into us and regenerating us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete 2 Tim 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After being regenerated by the word of God, the Bible teaches, convicts, corrects, and instructs us in righteousness so that we may be complete before God as regenerated men of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For our instruction, in order that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope Rom 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The teachings of the Bible enable us to endure and provide us with encouragement and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many believers are unable to endure when they encounter difficulties or sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They become discouraged and lose hope.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, simply reading a section or even a sentence of the Bible often provides us with the inward strength to endure and supplies encouragement and hope that is beyond our expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we encounter difficulties, we are helped and established by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>An example...written for our admonition 1 Cor 10:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many things are recorded in the Bible as examples for our admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we read the Bible, we can be warned by the experiences of some who went before us, and we can be careful not to follow their example.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is another help that believers find in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A lamp shining in a dark place 2 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Often the Bible is like a lamp shining in a dark place.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are in a dark night because the age in which we live is dark Rom 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In this darkness the Bible is like a shining lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It causes us to know our situation so that we do not become lost and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we want to be enlightened and knowledgeable in this dark age, we must understand the Bible and keep the word of the Bible in our hearts so that it can shine and enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A lamp to my feet / And a light to my path Psa 119:105; see also Prov 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>People walking in the dark need a lamp to shine on the path of their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Bible functions in this capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As we walk in this dark age, we truly need a heavenly lamp to shine on our every step so that we do not leave our path and fall into a deep pit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Bible is a heavenly lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we read the Bible and keep the word of the Bible in our heart, it will become a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It will shine continually on our footsteps according to our need.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Gives light, / Imparting understanding to the simple Psa 119:130 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The light from the Bible not only shines upon our feet and path; it also imparts understanding to the simple.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many who are simple by nature have gained understanding through reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Furthermore, anyone who wants to understand spiritual matters must understand the Bible and be enlightened by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Keep his way pure Psa 119:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In addition to containing the power to enlighten, the word in the Bible has the power to cleanse.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Enlightenment is in contrast to darkness, and purification is in contrast to filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The age in which we live is filthy and dark.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The word of the Bible causes all darkness to vanish when it shines on our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It cleanses our actions by removing everything that is filthy and impure.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is especially important to young people.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If we read the Bible frequently, we will not only be enlightened but also kept pure.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Every time we approach the Bible, its word will pass through us and enlighten and cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The word of the Bible will cleanse us, even if we cannot always remember what we have read.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is like a bamboo basket being dipped in water; it will be cleansed even though the water leaks away.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we want to be pure, we must read the Bible frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>That I might not sin against You Psa 119:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The Bible also prevents us from sinning against God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We were born in sin, have grown up in sin, and easily sin against God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we store the words of the Bible in our heart, they will constantly remind and warn us so that we do not sin against God.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The sword of the Spirit Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The word in the Bible is the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We can apply it by the Holy Spirit to deal with Satan and his messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Through the word of the Bible, we can defeat the devil, the enemy, who tempts and attacks us.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness, He defeated the tempter, the devil, through the word of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Therefore, in order to fight and defeat Satan and the evil spirits, we must read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We must be familiar with the Bible and be able to use it to deal with spiritual enemies at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Sharper than any two-edged sword Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The word of the Bible is as sharp as a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>It can deal with our spiritual enemies, but it can also divide our soul from our spirit and discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>It divides what is of the soul and what is of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>It also enables us to discern the thoughts and intentions that come from ourselves and those that come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The word exposes our entire inward condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Nothing can be hidden in us, and everything is made manifest through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>For example, a brother who preaches the gospel and casts out demons according to his natural zeal can be touched when reading Matthew 7:21-22, which says, Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>As he is reading, the word will pierce him and cause him to see that his preaching of the gospel and his casting out of demons are according to soulish zeal, rather than God s revelation in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This exposes his zealousness as being from himself, according to the power of his soul, rather than from the will of God, according to the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>In this way, the word of the Bible enables him to discern that the source of his gospel preaching and casting out of demons is his soul rather than his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Consequently, in the matters of preaching the gospel and casting out demons, the word separates his soul from his spirit, causing him to reject his soul in these matters and to rely on his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>A sister who plans to marry an unbeliever may be touched when she reads 2 Corinthians 6:14, which says, Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>This word can pierce her heart and cause her to see that her desire to marry an unbeliever is according to her own will, not God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Thus, the word enables her to discern that she is following her will and minding the preferences of her flesh rather than God s will and heart s desire in the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>When the will in her soul is divided from God s will in her spirit, she will be saved from the desires of her flesh in this important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Rather than following her flesh and the desires of her heart, she will obey the peerless will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Then she will please God and be preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>The word of the Bible is always living and operative in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>It is sharper than any two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>There is no amount of mixture within us that cannot be divided and discerned by the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>The word will always expose our real condition, bringing our situation into the shining of the light from His face.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This will empower us to live in our spirit, forsaking our self and the thoughts of the self in order to live in God and in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>I ate Jer 15:16; see also Matt 4:4; Job 23:12; Heb 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The Bible is food for our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Just as our physical life needs nourishment, our spiritual life needs nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>The word is the only thing that can supply nourishment to our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>If we want to be strong and living before God, we cannot live on bread alone; we need the word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, which is the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>We must eat the word of the Bible like food and even esteem the Bible more highly than food.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>We need to eat the word in order for our spiritual life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>We also must exercise to understand the more difficult portions in the Bible in order to be full-grown men, who are able to eat solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Without this eating and exercise, we will not become strong in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>15.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Milk of the word 1 Pet 2:2; see also 1 Cor 3:1-2; Heb 5:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>The Bible is not only solid food but also milk for our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Solid food is for adults; milk is for infants.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>When our spiritual life is mature and we have an understanding of spiritual matters, we can extract the nourishment of solid food from the Bible, strengthening our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>When our spiritual life is immature and we lack an adequate understanding of spiritual matters, there are portions of the word of the Bible that are like milk, which can nourish us and cause our spiritual life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Therefore, newly regenerated believers must love the word of the Bible and as newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>If they do not, they will remain babes in Christ and their spiritual life will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Washing ; Clean Eph 5:26; John 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>The word of the Bible washes our outward actions and removes our outward defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>It also washes us inwardly and frees us from the weaknesses of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>Ephesians 5:26 refers to this kind of washing.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>The Lord uses the water of life within us to wash us through the word of the Bible, eliminating the spots and wrinkles of the old creation.</S>
