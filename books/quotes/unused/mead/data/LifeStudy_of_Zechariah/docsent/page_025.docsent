   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE VISION OF THE EPHAH VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 5 through 11 describe the vision of the ephah vessel, which is the measuring vessel, a container able to hold one ephah, used for purchasing and selling in business.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Its Appearance in All the Land</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And I said, What is it?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And he said, This is the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their appearance in all the land" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A large percentage of the world's population is engaged in business or commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The appearance of business is not that bad; rather, in all the land commerce seems to have a proper appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as we will see, actually today's commerce is totally wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. A Woman Sitting within the Ephah Vessel</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"This is a woman sitting within the ephah vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he said, This is Wickedness" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>7b-8a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This reveals that the woman sitting within the ephah vessel signifies the wickedness contained in commerce, such as covetousness, deceit, and the love of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seller loves money and tries to get money out of the buyer's pocket; the buyer also loves money and tries to obtain the things he wants at a low price, thereby saving money.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The vision in Zechariah 5 corresponds to that of Babylon the Great in Revelation 18.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These visions show us that in the sight of God the wickedness contained in commerce is a kind of idolatry and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Business is an adulterous woman desirous of making money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. A Lead Cover Thrown</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>over the Opening of the Ephah Vessel</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Zechariah 5:7 and 8 we see that a lead cover, a lead weight, is thrown over the opening of the ephah vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This signifies the restriction of the wickedness in commerce by God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wickedness is hidden and concealed in international trade.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If commerce, especially international trade, could be restricted, the whole earth would be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Two Women Going Forth</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Then I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and behold, there were two women going forth" v. 9a . The one woman becoming two women signifies the double effect of commerce once it becomes free of the restriction.</S>
