   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Disciples Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 11:8-16 we see the disciples opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the news came about Lazarus sickness, the Lord s heart was not moved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The disciples must have been puzzled and perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can imagine how disappointed the disciples were.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After two days, the Lord suddenly expressed the desire to see Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may awaken him out of sleep 11:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The disciples immediately said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see the disciples human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord did not want to go, they were puzzled, and when the Lord was about to go, they thought that it was not necessary to go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once the Lord expressed His desire to go and see Lazarus, all of the disciples expressed their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They told the Lord that it was dangerous to go because the Jews sought to stone Him 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is human opinion, which always contradicts the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, once the Lord made up His mind that He was going to see Lazarus, no one could change it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the disciples agreed to go, but with a martyr s attitude fearing the Jews persecution, for one of them said, Let us also go, that we may die with Him 11:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times in every local church the situation is exactly like this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are plenty of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Martha s Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord came, Martha was the first one to meet Him 11:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But before the Lord could say anything, Martha opened her mouth and gave forth another opinion: Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died 11:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She was complaining that the Lord had come too late.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said to her, Your brother shall rise again 11:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the Lord would raise him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, Martha said, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Martha expounded this word of the Lord so as to postpone the present resurrection to the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What an expounding of the divine word!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What devastating knowledge of fundamental teaching that frustrates people from enjoying the Lord s present resurrection life!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Lord Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes in Me shall by no means die forever 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord seemed to be telling her, It is not a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no problem of time with Me. Nothing is too late, and nothing is too early.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as I am here, everything will be all right, for I will raise up your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the Lord asked Martha, Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Martha replied, Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What she answered absolutely was not what the Lord asked.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was not clear about what the Lord was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Her old, preoccupying knowledge prevented her from understanding the Lord s new word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Martha is like many Christians today who have a great deal of knowledge and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Martha said, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This sounds quite scriptural and correct.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then the Lord asked her if she believed that He would raise Lazarus up, and she said, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She believed in a certain kind of doctrine that the Lord is the Christ and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She believed in the doctrine that the Lord will raise up all of the dead saints in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She had all the knowledge, but it was not the living knowledge that the Lord taught.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of her different opinions were due to the fact that she had all the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, many Christians have opinions because they have so many teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When someone talks with them about the inner life, they immediately begin to share their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Too much knowledge and too many doctrines breed endless opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After Martha said that she believed the Lord to be the Christ, the Son of God, she went away and called her sister Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Martha said, The Teacher is here and is calling you 11:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, I cannot find a word saying that the Lord had called for Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That was Martha s suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was her self-assuming opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again we see in Martha a person who was so full of her own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She was so active in her opinion that she could never be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps you also love the Lord very much, but, like Martha, you cannot be silent.</S>
