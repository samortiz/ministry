   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S JUDGMENTS AND HIS LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to 28:29 and 30, the breastplate was not only a memorial before the Lord, but was also a plate of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the Urim and the Thummim were added into the breastplate, it became the breastplate of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 29 and 30 speak of judgment, not of leading or guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The judgments mentioned in Deuteronomy 33:10 are related to the Urim and the Thummim in 33:8, where we are told that the priests, the Levites, would have the Thummim and the Urim.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The judgments in Deuteronomy 33:10 refer to the judgments in Exodus 28:29 and 30.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In both portions of the Word judgment is related to the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In English judgment may mean the action of judging or a decision of judging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is not an accurate understanding of the word judgment as used in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Deuteronomy 33:10 the judgments are part of God s law, which is a totality of God s regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Usually when we think of the law of God, we think of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the law includes more than the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen, the Ten Commandments recorded in Exodus 20 are supplemented by the ordinances and regulations recorded in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these regulations are judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the law not only includes the Ten Commandments, but also includes regulations and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of these ordinances concerned punishment for smiting others, and some were related to making recompense for damage to others property.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All such regulations are judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The English word judgment used to translate Deuteronomy 33:10 and Exodus 28:29 and 30 can be misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It may be regarded as an action of judging or even as an opinion, for our judgment may refer to our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, judgment may also involve evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this is not the meaning of judgment with respect to the breastplate of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word judgment in these verses indicates that God has a regulation concerning everything among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the regulations will issue in judgments, and these judgments become God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the leading of God comes from His judgments, which are based on His regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we were on Exodus 21 through 23, we pointed out that these chapters are supplements to the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First God gave the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He issued many regulations and ordinances as supplements to these commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Ten Commandments are the principles of God s regulations, but the supplements in Exodus 21 through 23 provide the details of these regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these detailed regulations we have God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This judgment leads us to certain decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, we have God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s regulations always include His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, if we would receive the Lord s leading, many things about us need to be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our flesh, our wrongdoings, and our natural life must all be judged by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s regulations require that all these things be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What remains afterward is truly of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way we come to know God s leading.</S>
