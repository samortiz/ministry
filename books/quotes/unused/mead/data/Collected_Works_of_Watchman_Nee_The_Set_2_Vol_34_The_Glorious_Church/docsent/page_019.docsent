   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 3:16 is a verse many of us can quote from memory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps we have known it for ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is this verse the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Certainly it is the Word of God, but it is logos.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There comes a day, however, when we read this verse and it is entirely different to us than it ever was before.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"For God so loved the world..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now, God does not just love the world, He loves me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"...that He gave His only begotten Son..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God did not give His Son just to the world, but to me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"...that every one who believes into Him..."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not that someone believes into Him, but that I believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"...would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is I who will not perish, and it is I who even now have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word is now rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God speaks the word to us, and at the same moment, we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we must ask God, "O God, if You would be gracious to me, I pray that You would always give me rhema."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This does not mean that logos is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Logos has its definite use, for without logos, we could never have rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the rhema of God is based upon logos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot deny that John 3:16 is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when the logos of God becomes the rhema spoken by God to us, we have faith and the whole matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Did the Jews not have the logos of God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, they did.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were very familiar with it and could recite the Old Testament commandments very well, but it was of no use to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only the words which the Lord spoke to them were spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only rhema is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mark 14:72 says, "And immediately a rooster crowed a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And Peter remembered the word, how Jesus had said to him, Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And thinking upon it, he wept."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter recalled the rhema that Jesus had spoken to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The rhema was that which was brought to his remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While Peter was telling a lie, suddenly rhema came.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The very sentence of the Lord came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rhema is the word which the Lord has spoken, and now He speaks it again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Luke 1:38 Mary said, "Behold, the slave of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May it happen to me according to your word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the angel departed from her."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this verse rhema is used.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was not just a word of prophecy in Isaiah 7:14, "Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son," but a word that was spoken specifically to Mary by the angel, "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son" Luke 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because Mary heard this, she received strength and it was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Luke 2:29 Simeon said, "Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Word" in this verse is rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before the Lord Jesus came, God spoke His word to Simeon that he would not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But on the day he saw the Lord Jesus, Simeon said, "Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Simeon had rhema from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was not according to a certain chapter or a certain verse in the Bible, but it was according to the word spoken to him on that day by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Merely having the word from a certain chapter and verse in the Bible is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the word which the Lord speaks to us is of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The rhema reveals something to us personally and directly; it shows us what we need to deal with and what we need to be cleansed from.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must specifically seek after this very matter, because our Christian life is based on this rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What word has God really spoken to us, and how has He spoken to us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must remember that today's Christianity is still the Christianity of personal revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord does not speak within man, it is not Christianity, nor is it the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Luke 3:2 says, "During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Word" in this verse is also rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Luke 5:5 says, "Simon answered and said, Master, through the whole night we toiled and caught nothing; but based on Your word I will let down the nets."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The "word" in this verse was something spoken by the Lord for that occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was the Lord speaking personally to Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord did not speak in a certain chapter and verse of the Scripture that Simon should let down the net.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If someone attempted to walk on the sea because of Matthew 14:29, he would certainly sink.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not the word which the Lord is speaking today, though He did speak it on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is true that the word spoken by God in the past and the word He speaks today carry the same authority; they have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the important thing is this: Is God speaking that very word to us today?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Luke 24:8 says, "They remembered His words rhema ."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In short what is rhema?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rhema is something the Lord has spoken previously which He is now speaking again.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In other words, rhema is the word which the Lord speaks the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is something living.</S>
