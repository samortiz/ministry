The Treasure with the Excellent Power</H2><P>Second Corinthians 4:6-7 says, "Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us." This shows that God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels! Furthermore, out of these vessels the excellency of the divine power will be made manifest. This excellency of the power is of God and not out of us.</P><P>The indwelling Christ as the treasure in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply of the Christian life. By the excellent power of this treasure we are able to experience the killing of the cross so that the resurrection life of Christ may be made manifest. Thus, we manifest the truth for the shining of the gospel. This is Christ as the treasure with the excellent power in the believers.</P>
