Thank the Lord that we can still receive the news concerning the travels of the brothers and sisters and the work, even though we are in an unstable environment. We really gain great comfort from it. By the Lord's grace, the church here has been under His leading. However, the brothers need more growth in spiritual life to stand firm for the Lord. Please pray for this. The locality of Dong-Jang is eleven miles from here. The Lord's servants, Chen Jai-seng, Chai Tze-chung, and Chen Ke-san, have gone there to work, as have other brothers who love the Lord. A meeting has been raised up there. They preach the gospel every Lord's Day afternoon. God has really blessed the work, and the number of saved ones has been increasing. There are many sisters who are especially diligent in serving the Lord. We are sending an offering of X dollars from the brothers and sisters in our locality by postal wire. Please distribute it to the brothers and sisters in need. May the Lord give us more love in our hearts to the glory of His name. Brother Lin Wei-zhe returned from Singapore in February.</p><p>The brothers who meet in the Lord's name in Yu-Si,<br />Lin Wei-zhe, Lin Shao-liang, Tseng Geng-seng, Chai Yi-sung<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Foochow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>We have received every issue of The Open Door which you sent. After returning to Foochow from Amoy, we remained idle at home for six months because of the environment. This year Shao-geng and Shao-fang took up some odd jobs in the provincial capital. The Lord is still giving us peace. We thank Him unceasingly. We are sending X dollars for printing costs and X dollars for the work in the inland regions. Sister Ma Chu-feng sent a letter from Southeast Asia asking us to send another X dollars. X dollars of the amount are for the brothers and sisters in need, and X dollars are to defray the costs of the Gospel Book Room. Please greet the church in Hankow.</p><p>The weak ones in the Lord,<br />Hsu Shao-geng, Shao-hwa, and Shao-fang<br />April 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I am enclosing a bank draft from the Bank of China for distribution to the brothers and sisters in need because of the war.
