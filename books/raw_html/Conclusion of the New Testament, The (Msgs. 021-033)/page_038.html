 <h2 class="head2">4. The One Enthroned for God&rsquo;s Administration</h2>
<p>Another aspect of Christ in ascension is that He is the One enthroned for God&rsquo;s administration. Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ is now &ldquo;seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; For Christ to be seated at the right hand of the throne of God does not mean that He is seated next to the throne of God, at God&rsquo;s right hand. In Revelation we see that there is only one throne of both God and Christ (Rev. 3:21; 22:1, 3), one throne for both God and the Lamb. Christ has been enthroned in His ascension. His ascension was for His enthronement for God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>According to the book of Revelation, the throne on which the ascended Christ is sitting is the throne of the divine administration: &ldquo;I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth&rdquo; (Rev. 5:6). The Lamb, the Redeemer, the One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne carrying out God&rsquo;s administration over the entire universe. The Lord Jesus has been enthroned to execute God&rsquo;s governmental operation in the universe. As the Lamb with the seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God, He is carrying out God&rsquo;s administration for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is also the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). As the Ruler of the kings He is far above all earthly rulers. Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents; actually the Lord Jesus rules the whole earth through the earthly authorities. Even all the kings and presidents are under His rule. Today He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). He is the Ruler of all the ones who are in power. He is the chief Ruler in the divine government for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Leader and Savior</h2>
<p>Acts 5:31 says that God has exalted Christ &ldquo;to His right hand as a Leader and Savior.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; is <em>archegos,</em> meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain. This word is used only four times in the New Testament and always in reference to Christ (Acts 3:15; Heb. 2:10; 12:2). It has been translated a number of different ways in various versions because there is no precise English equivalent to the Greek. The thought is that this One is the origin and Originator, the Author, the Leader, and the Inaugurator. He is above all and spontaneously is the Ruler with authority. God has exalted Jesus, the One rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader. His being the Leader is a matter related to His authority. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God&rsquo;s chosen people to receive His salvation (Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2).</p>
<p>The One God has exalted to His right hand is also the Savior. Jesus&rsquo; incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man&rsquo;s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader so that He might be the Savior.</p>
<p>When Christ was on earth, He saved Peter, John, and many others. However, although the title Savior is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry (John 4:42), He was not officially the Savior until His ascension. We were saved officially by the Christ on the throne, by the One in glory. When we were saved, we were seated with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). Christ has saved us from the throne and to the throne. This is the ascended Christ as our Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. Lord of All</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is Lord of all (Acts 2:36; 10:36). As God, Christ was the Lord all the time (Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28). But as man He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection. In ascension Christ was made the Lord of all to possess all. In Acts 10:36 Peter speaks of Christ as the One who is &ldquo;Lord of all.&rdquo; &ldquo;All&rdquo; refers here to all men, all peoples. Christ in His ascension is the Lord not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. He is the Lord of all the different races and peoples on earth.</p>
<p>Acts 2:36 tells us that Christ was made Lord. As we have seen, He was Lord before His ascension, but He was not officially inaugurated into this office. One of the Old Testament names for God is Lord (Heb., <em>Adonai),</em> meaning master. Christ in the Old Testament was Adonai. Then He became a man, a despised Nazarene. This very One was Lord even when He was on earth. But it was not until His ascension that He was inaugurated into His lordship. Christ in His ascension was inaugurated as Lord of all, not only of all men, but also of all things.</p>
<p>As the Lord, Christ now possesses the whole universe, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons. Christ is the Lord not only of God&rsquo;s chosen people, but also of the angels and of all those who will be in the millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth. Therefore, He is the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything and everyone He has redeemed. In ascension He is the Lord of all to possess all.</p>
