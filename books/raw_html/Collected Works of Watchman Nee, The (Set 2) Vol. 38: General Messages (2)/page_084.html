<h2 class="head1">THE SUBMISSION OF THE WIFE<br />BRINGING IN BLESSING TO THE FAMILY</h2><p>The husband's demands on the wife are not always that pleasant. Once I was a guest at a brother's house. There was a constant difference of opinion in the house. One person wanted to do one thing, and the other person wanted to do another thing. But the wife in the house was very submissive. Although there were differences in opinion, she was very submissive. Although she did not follow her husband's opinion, she was still very submissive and gentle in her attitude. She said to her husband in a very gentle way, "I cannot do this." Although she did not obey, she was very gentle in her attitude, and the family was a very harmonious one. The cushion of a family is the woman. The floor beneath us does not make any noise because the carpet cushions it. The cushion of a family is the gentleness of the woman. Once we have such a cushion, there will not be much noise in the family. It is true that an unsaved husband may not allow you to be baptized or bind up your hair. But sisters, when you have a husband that does not allow you to do these things, what attitude will you take? Will you say in your heart that you wish you could obey his word but that you cannot? I can tell you honestly that after being a Christian for many years, I have often failed to obey God. Yet God disciplines me and shows me something, and I still fear my God. I have not succeeded in doing many things, but I still fear God; I am still fearful before Him. I wish I could obey. Of course it is another thing when God makes us able to obey. I say this to show you God's demand for us today. There is one element that will keep a family in peace: submission in the sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE IN THE BROTHERS</h2><p>On the other hand, the brothers have to love; they have to love their wives. Verse 25 is after verse 24. In a family, after the wife submits, the demand is on the husband to love. A husband's love is something active; it is manifested in making provisions for many things. This is not a passive love but an active love. The husband has to actively assume the headship in the family; he has to make arrangements and provisions, provide protection, and take up the responsibility in the family. The ugliest thing in this world is finding a wife who is not submissive. It is also very ugly finding a husband who does not know how to be the head.</p><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE POSITION THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED</h2><p>During these days, two or three brothers have come to me to ask about marriage. I said that there are four kinds of marriages in this world. Only one of the four is good; the other three are bad. The first kind is for a man to marry a woman, that is, for a proper man to marry a proper woman. This is the best kind. The second kind is not as good, which is for a "woman" to marry a woman, that is, for a submissive man to marry a submissive woman. The third kind is for a man to marry a "man," that is, for a responsible man to marry a responsible woman. The fourth kind is for a submissive man to be married to a responsible woman; it will end up being a terrible family. Such a family is hopeless; nothing can be worse than this kind. I thank the Lord that God's ordination is always wonderful. He ordains a man to be a man. The man has to love and actively take up the responsibility of the family. He has to make arrangements for everything in the house. God loves to see a man be a man. He hates to see a man looking like a woman. The woman should submit. God wants the woman to submit. Submission is in a woman's nature; it is the woman's nature to submit. This is very important. Brother Yang, you can never say to your wife, "Why can't I do what you can do?" You can say this anywhere else, but you cannot say this in the family. You can never say to your wife, "Why can't I do what you can do?" You have to remember that you cannot do what she can do. Similarly, she cannot do what you can do. A wife cannot say to the husband, "Why can't I do what you can do?", and the husband cannot say this to the wife. If you can do what your wife can do, you have become a woman already, and you have not stood on the position that God has ordained for you. A wife cannot say this to her husband, and a husband cannot say this to his wife. This is God's ordination.</p><p>May the Lord bless our brother and our sister and show them their responsibilities. You may say, "If I had known that it would be that troublesome, I would not have come this far." This is why I told you earlier that you cannot have a family unless you are spiritual; you will not be able to make it. Many people think that it is a simple thing to have a family. But I must tell you that a family will be an acid test to you. It will show what you can and cannot do. May the Lord bless our brother so that he can love his wife and take up his responsibility to protect, arrange, provide, supply, and be the head of the family. At the same time, may the Lord bless our sister so that she can become a genuine wife and submit in a genuine way. If we all do this, many of the problems in our families will be eliminated, and many blessings will be ushered in.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENCES<br />BETWEEN THE HUSBAND AND THE WIFE</h2><p>There is one final word. Today is the first day for you to begin to deal with your problems together. Do not misunderstand, this is not the first day for you to take a nice walk in the park. If you learn your lesson well, perhaps in five years you will have a wonderful family. What is a honeymoon? A honeymoon is the beginning of days of suffering. When will you begin to have some sweet days? If you deal with the differences between the husband and the wife properly, you may have sweet days after five years. But you have to begin to learn before you can expect those days to come. You have to put in some effort before you learn.</p><p>Once again, may the Lord bless the two of you and pour down His blessings upon you, and may you be dealt with and learn your lessons day by day. May the Lord bless both of you.</p>
