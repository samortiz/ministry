[2]  In previous messages we covered the initial stage of God's full salvation, the stage of regeneration.
[3]  This stage begins with God's calling; it includes the believers' being sanctified, their repenting and believing, and their being baptized, joined to the processed Triune God, redeemed, made a new creation, and saved; and it ends with the clearing of the past.
[4]  a. Experiencing and Enjoying God as the Father in His Love
[5]  In experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we experience and enjoy the Father in His love.
[6]  Whatever the Father does in His dispensing and moving in us is in love and is based on love.
[7]  In Ephesians 4:6 Paul speaks of the "God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[8]  7 Coming, with the Son, to Them and Making an Abode with Them
[9]  God the Father not only gives grace to the believers, but He comes to them with the Son and makes an abode with them.
[10]  In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."
[11]  9 Imparting to Them His Great Power Which He Wrought in Christ
[12]  While God the Father imparts Himself to us, He imparts to us His great power which He wrought in Christ.
[13]  This is "the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies" Eph 1:19-20 .
[14]  The surpassing great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength which He wrought in Christ.
[15]  In this message we shall consider some finer matters related to the believers' experiencing and enjoying God as the Father in His love.
[16]  11 Making Them Live Together with Christ by His Power
[17]  God the Father also makes the believers His righteousness in Christ.
[18]  Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him."
[19]  Eventually, those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will experience and enjoy Him in the triune dispensing to such an extent that they will even become His righteousness in Christ.
[20]  15 Giving Life to Their Mortal Bodies by the Indwelling Spirit
[21]  Romans 8:11 says, "If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."
[22]  Here we see that God the Father gives life to our mortal bodies by the indwelling Spirit.
[23]  As we experience and enjoy God the Father in His love, He gives us growth in life.
[24]  In 1 Corinthians 3:6 and 7 Paul says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God."
[25]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love.
[26]  20 Giving Grace to Them according to the Operation of His Power, to Preach the Unsearchable Riches of Christ as the Gospel, and to Bring to Light What Is His Economy of the Mystery Hidden in Him, That Is, to Have the Church
[27]  21 Making Them Sufficient for the New Testament Ministry
[28]  As the Father dispenses Himself into the believers as grace to enable them to preach the all-inclusive Christ and to make known the mystery hidden in God, He makes them sufficient for the New Testament ministry.
[29]  This sufficiency is of God the Father by His dispensing.
[30]  As the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love, He has mercy on them.
[31]  Philippians 4:7 says, "The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
[32]  28 Disciplining Them That They Might Partake of His Holiness
[33]  The Father disciplines the believers that they might partake of His holiness.
[34]  Referring to the Hebrew believers' suffering of persecution, Hebrews 12:5-11 considers this persecution as God the Father's discipline of the believers, who are God's genuine sons v. 7 . "Whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives" v. 6 , and all the believers as God's sons have become partakers of the Father's discipline v. 8 . As sons of God, we should respect the Father as a discipliner and be much in subjection to Him who is the Father of our spirits, so that we may live v. 9 . The Father disciplines us for our profit that we might partake of His holiness v. 10 , which is the characteristic of His holy nature.
[35]  Romans 16:20 reveals that God crushes Satan under the feet of the believers: "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet."
[36]  35 Raising Them Up and Presenting Them to Himself
[37]  Through the divine dispensing God also raises the believers up and presents them to Himself.
[38]  In 2 Corinthians 4:14 Paul says, "Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you."
[39]  Through His dispensing God the Father is making the believers His inheritance of glory.
[40]  38 Leading Them as His Many Sons into Glory
[41]  Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God is "leading many sons into glory."
[42]  He is God Titus 1:3; 3:4 , the Redeemer Rom 3:24 , the Passover 1 Cor 5:7 , the Savior Titus 1:4 , wisdom 1 Cor 1:30 , righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 , life Col 3:4 , the Sanctifier Heb 2:11; 13:12a , sanctification 1 Cor 1:30 , the redemption of our body 1 Cor 1:30 , the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , the freeing and transforming Spirit 2 Cor 3:17-18 , the door to leave the fold John 10:9a , the pasture John 10:9b , the Shepherd John 10:11 , the vine John 15:1 , the abiding place John 15:4a , the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 , spiritual food 1 Cor 10:3; John 6:48, 57b , the rock flowing with the spiritual drink 1 Cor 10:4 , light John 1:4; Eph 5:14 , the way John 14:6 , the reality John 14:6 , the hope of glory Col 1:27 , peace Eph 2:14; John 14:27; 16:33 , joy John 15:11; 17:13; Phil 3:1; 4:4 , rest Matt 11:28-29 , the feast Col 2:16-17 , the new moon Col 2:16-17 , the Sabbath Col 2:16-17 , the armor Eph 6:11, 13-17 , the One living within the believers that they may live Him Gal 2:20; John 6:57b; Phil 1:21 , the One being formed within them Gal 4:19 , the One making His home in their hearts Eph 3:17 , the One magnified in them Phil 1:20 , the One empowering them Phil 4:13 , the treasure of excellent power 2 Cor 4:7 , the depths of God 1 Cor 2:10 , a model 1 Pet 2:21 , the Author and Perfecter of faith Heb 12:2 , the Captain of salvation Heb 2:10 , the Forerunner Heb 6:20 , the Apostle Heb 3:1 , the High Priest Heb 4:14; 7:26 , the Husband 2 Cor 11:2 , the Bridegroom John 3:29 , the Head 1 Cor 11:3 , the Lord Rom 14:8; Eph 1:17 , the Master Lord Eph 6:9 , Master Sovereign Lord 2 Pet 2:1; Jude 4 , the Friend John 15:15 , the Brother Rom 8:29; John 20:17; Heb 2:11 , the Partner Heb 1:9; 3:14 , the Physician Matt 9:12 , the Helper Heb 13:6 , and the Overseer 1 Pet 2:25 .
[43]  Christ is not only our life; He as a person lives in us.
[44]  b For Them to Be Saved in His Life
[45]  Christ's living in us is also for us to be saved in His life.
[46]  "If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life" Rom 5:10 .
[47]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers' experiencing and enjoying Christ as the One living in them. f For Them to Have Him Formed in Them
[48]  Christ lives in the believers also that they may boast in Him.
[49]  In Philippians 3:3 Paul says, "We are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
[50]  j For Them to Gain Him by Counting All Things Loss and Refuse
[51]  Christ lives in us for us to gain Him by counting all things loss and refuse.
[52]  In Philippians 3:7 and 8 Paul says, "What things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.
[53]  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ."
[54]  k For Them to Know Him and the Power of His Resurrection and the Fellowship of His Sufferings
[55]  Philippians 3:10a indicates that Christ lives in us for us "to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings."
[56]  To know Christ means to experience Him, to enjoy Him, to participate in Him, and to partake of Him.
[57]  In a very real sense, Christ's sufferings have not yet been completed.
[58]  Consider Paul's word in Colossians 1:24: "Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church."
[59]  As the Head, Christ's sufferings for the accomplishment of redemption are complete, but the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body are not yet finished.
[60]  We have seen that, in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, Christ lives in the believers for them to walk in Him, to be saved in His life, to live through Him by eating Him as the bread of life, to live with Him, to live Him, to have Him formed in them, to magnify Him, to boast in Him, to be found in Him, to gain Him by counting all things loss and refuse, and to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.
[61]  Now we need to see that Christ lives in us for us to be conformed to His death. l For Them to Be Conformed to His Death
[62]  m For Them to Be Delivered from Every Evil Work
[63]  In 2 Timothy 4:18a Paul says, "The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom."
[64]  o For Them to Be Able to Do All Things in Him Who Empowers Them
[65]  Christ lives in the believers for them to be able to do all things in Him who empowers them.
[66]  p For Them to Have Him Making His Home in Their Hearts
[67]  Ephesians 3:17a indicates that Christ lives in the believers for them to have Him making His home in their hearts.
[68]  In previous messages we covered many aspects of the believers' experiencing and enjoying Christ as the Son in His grace.
[69]  In this message we shall cover four other matters related to this and then go on to consider the believers' experiencing and enjoying the Spirit as the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship. r For Them to Apprehend His Breadth, Length, Height, and Depth
[70]  s For Them to Know His Knowledge-surpassing Love
[71]  In Ephesians 3:19a Paul says, "To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ."
[72]  u For Them to Be Built Up in Him
[73]  The last aspect of the believers' experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in His grace is that He lives in them for them to be built up in Him.
[74]  1 As the Reality of Christ for Their Enjoyment
[75]  John 14:17-20 indicates that the Spirit is the reality of Christ for the believers' enjoyment.
[76]  Because Christ Himself is reality John 14:6 , when He was with the disciples, reality was with them.
[77]  With respect to His person, the Spirit is the Holy Spirit Luke 1:15b, 35; Matt 1:18, 20; John 20:22; Rom 15:16 , the Spirit of God Matt 3:16; Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of the Father Matt 10:20 , the Spirit of the Lord Luke 4:18; 2 Cor 3:17 , the Spirit of the Son of God Gal 4:6 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9; 1 Pet 1:11 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 , the Spirit of the living God 2 Cor 3:3 , the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of grace Heb 10:29 , the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6 , the Comforter the Paraclete, John 14:16 , the Spirit of power Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8 , the Spirit of glory and of God 1 Pet 4:14 , the eternal Spirit Heb 9:14 , the seven Spirits Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 , and the Spirit John 7:39; Acts 6:3; Gal 3:2; Rev 2:7; 22:17 .
[78]  In the progressing stage of God's full salvation the believers not only experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing but also experience God's redemption continuously.
[79]  The believers experience God's redemption in being forgiven of their sins through their confessing of sins.
[80]  First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[81]  First John 1:7 says, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin."
[82]  When we live in the divine life, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God's nature, all our sin, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness.
[83]  At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins so that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained.
[84]  1 In the Holy Spirit as the Sanctifying Power
[85]  First Corinthians 6:11 tells us that we are sanctified in the Spirit of our God.
[86]  A number of verses in the New Testament speak of pursuing holiness.
[87]  We have seen that in the progressing stage of God's full salvation the believers experience God's redemption continuously in being forgiven of their sins, washed, and sanctified.
[88]  Now we shall see that the believers experience God's redemption also in being justified and in being reconciled to God in the second step. d.
[89]  a Christ Living Out of Them to Be Their Righteousness
[90]  The righteousness which is the condition for the believers to be found in Christ is actually Christ Himself living out of them to be their righteousness.
[91]  Christ is the righteousness by which we are justified by God 1 Cor 1:30 .
[92]  Then we shall not simply be found in Christ in a general way, but we shall be found in the very righteousness which is Christ Himself lived out of us. b Christ Living a Righteous Life in Them
[93]  Second Corinthians 5:19 and 20 indicate that there are two steps for the believers to be fully reconciled to God.
[94]  The first step is as sinners to be reconciled to God from sin v. 19 . For this purpose Christ died for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 that they may be forgiven by God.
[95]  2 Through the Death for the Believers Themselves of Christ Who Was Made Sin for Them
[96]  The believers are reconciled to God in the second step through the death of Christ not for the believers' sins but for the believers themselves.
[97]  The New Testament reveals that Christ died for our sins and for us.
[98]  According to the revelation in the New Testament, the first matter in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, is experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing.
[99]  We experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love, Christ as the Son in His grace, and the Spirit as the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship 2 Cor 13:14 .
[100]  The enjoyment of the Father in His love, of the Son in His grace, and of the Spirit in His fellowship is a matter of God's dispensing 2 Cor 13:14 .
[101]  Second Corinthians 3:18 speaks of beholding and reflecting "with unveiled face."
[102]  This indicates that our heart has turned to the Lord so that the veil has been taken away v. 16 , and the Lord as the Spirit has freed us from the bondage, the veiling, of the law so that there is no longer any insulation between us and the Lord.
[103]  In 3:18 Paul tells us that we are in the process of being transformed into "the same image."
[104]  In the foregoing message we saw that the believers are being transformed, having been freed from the bondage of the law by the Spirit of the Lord.
[105]  Now, with unveiled face, we are transformed by beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord into the image of Christ from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[106]  The believers are being transformed in the spirit of their mind Eph 4:23 .
[107]  Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.
[108]  For the believers to bear the cross is for them to identify themselves with the crucified Christ.
[109]  Christ underwent death by crucifixion, and we must be one with Him.
[110]  This is to identify ourselves not with the glorified Christ but with a crucified Christ. b To Stay in the Death of Christ
[111]  3 Crucifying Their Flesh with the Passions and the Lusts
[112]  "They who are of Christ Jesus" refers to those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Him.
[113]  b To Experience the Death of Christ Practically, Not Living Habitually according to the Flesh
[114]  If we would be conformed to the death of Christ and thereby conformed to His image, we should not live habitually, that is, we should not live according to our habits.
[115]  We deny the self by experiencing the death of Christ subjectively in a particular way.
[116]  The experience of the cross of Christ has three steps: first, the crucifying of our old man, which is an objective fact accomplished by Christ; second, our acknowledging and receiving this fact and declaring, "I have been crucified with Christ"; third, our going on to experience this fact subjectively.
[117]  a The Reality of the Denying of Their Self and the Bearing of the Cross
[118]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 34
[119]  3 To the Throne of Grace within the Veil to Receive Mercy and Find Grace from the Ascended Christ in the Heavens
[120]  After indicating by what kind of death Peter would glorify God, the Lord Jesus said to him, "Follow Me!"
[121]  As the believers follow Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach, they follow in His steps 1 Pet 2:21 .
[122]  Second Corinthians 5:14 and 15 say, "The love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and has been raised."
[123]  In 2 Corinthians 5:15 Paul says that the Lord Jesus "died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him."
[124]  By Walking according to Spirit Walking by the Spirit
[125]  Romans 8:6 says, "The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[126]  The spirit in this verse refers to the mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.
[127]  5 Not Fulfilling the Lusts of the Flesh, but Bringing Forth the Fruit of the Spirit
[128]  As the believers walk by the Spirit, they do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh but instead bring forth the fruit of the Spirit Gal 5:22-23 .
[129]  When we live to Christ and walk according to spirit, we have no interest or willingness to fulfill the lusts of our flesh.
[130]  b Concerning Righteousness in Christ Because of the Son's Going to the Father in Resurrection and Ascension
[131]  In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus says that the Spirit will convict the world "concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me."
[132]  a Through Christ's Going and Coming Death and Resurrection
[133]  The believers have been brought forth as a new child through Christ's going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection.
[134]  3 Abiding in the Son the Vine as the Organism of the Divine Trinity with the Father as the Expression of the Father
[135]  In the foregoing message we saw that, as those living in the organism of the divine Trinity, the believers have been convicted by the Spirit of reality, they have been brought forth as the new child, and they abide in the Son with the Father to bear fruit for the Father's glorification.
[136]  Now we shall go on to see that the believers are indwelt by the Spirit and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity.
[137]  The Spirit dwells within us as the reality of the Son John 14:18-20 .
[138]  When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit as the reality of Christ, and this Christ, the Son of God, is the embodiment of the Father Col 2:9 .
[139]  John 16:13-15 say, "When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
[140]  d For the Father to Be Glorified in the Glorification of the Son
[141]  Our participation in the dispensing of the divine Trinity is for the Father to be glorified in the glorification of the Son.
[142]  In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."
[143]  In previous messages we have seen that, in the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed, by being conformed to Christ's image and conformed to the death of Christ, by entering into the Holy of Holies, by following Jesus, by living to Christ, by walking according to spirit, by sowing unto the Spirit, by walking by faith, and by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity.
[144]  It is very difficult for the believers to be completely emptied in order to give the indwelling Spirit all the room in our spirit and in our mind, emotion, and will.
[145]  The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God indwells us and desires to fill us.
[146]  Therefore, if we would be filled in our spirit with the Spirit, we need to clear away all preoccupations from our spirit and allow the indwelling Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God to occupy us in full.
[147]  If we compare Ephesians 5:18-20 with Colossians 3:16 and 17, we shall see that, as the New Testament reveals, the word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the word.
[148]  Here the Lord Jesus says, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life."
[149]  Concerning the Spirit, there are two extremes, one found among fundamentalists and the other among Pentecostalists.
[150]  Because they are afraid of the experience of the Spirit, certain fundamental Christians care primarily for Bible doctrine.
[151]  In the foregoing message we saw that the believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being filled in their spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in them richly Eph 5:18b; Col 3:16a .
[152]  If we are filled with grace, then in place of bitterness, wrath, anger, and clamor, we shall have kindness, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and grace.
[153]  These qualities come not from self-effort but from Christ as our enjoyment.
[154]  When Christ is our enjoyment, we have no appetite for bitterness, wrath, anger, or clamor.
[155]  2 To Live a Life That Matches the Wife of Christ in Love and Light
[156]  A second issue of being filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly is that we live a life that matches the wife of Christ Eph 5:22-25 in love and light.
[157]  When we are filled in our spirit with the Spirit and allow the word of Christ to make home in us, we automatically live a life that matches the new man in grace and truth and that matches the wife of Christ in love and light.
[158]  In this message we shall see that as the result of being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and of being saturated with the word of Christ, we shall also speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.
[159]  When we are filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we speak to one another, teaching, admonishing, in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing, psalming to the Lord, and giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.
[160]  4 Being Subject to One Another in the Fear of Christ to Live a Proper Human Life
[161]  Finally, by being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and by allowing the word of Christ to dwell in us richly, we are subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.
[162]  b Husbands Loving Their Own Wives as Christ Loving the Church
[163]  Ephesians 5:25 says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."
[164]  d Fathers Not Provoking Their Children to Anger, but Nurturing Them in the Discipline and Admonition of the Lord
[165]  Ephesians 6:4 says, "The fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord."
[166]  f Masters Doing the Same Things toward the Slaves, Giving Up Threatening
[167]  In Ephesians 6:9 Paul says, "The masters, do the same things toward them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him."
