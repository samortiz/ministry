   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE SIX DEALING WITH A FACTIOUS ONE Scripture Reading: Titus 3:9-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we consider 3:9-15, we need a further word on verses 4 through 7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 7 Paul says, "That, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Becoming heirs of God is the goal of His eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 4 through 6 we see some crucial matters needed to reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verses 4 and 5 we read of certain divine attributes: kindness, love, and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When these attributes are put together, we have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has exercised His love, mercy, kindness, and grace in order to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we are about to do something of great importance, we exercise our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our mind, will, emotion, heart, and even our disposition are exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner, God exercised His being in order to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He exercised His love, kindness, mercy, and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By means of these divine attributes God has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These attributes, however, are the source; they are not the activity or the process.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 3:5 and 6 we have activity, an action, constituting the process through which God saved us: "He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, Whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's salvation is based upon the exercise of His attributes and through the process of the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The goal is that we become God's heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul certainly was an excellent writer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Knowing that in verses 4 through 6 he had not written anything concerning justification, he inserts the words "having been justified by the grace of that One."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although justification is somewhat implied by the matters of salvation and washing, Paul mentions it explicitly in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been saved, washed, and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The grace by which we are justified is the totality of God's kindness, love, and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These attributes are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when they become a totality in our experience, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Kindness, love, and mercy are of the Father, whereas grace is of Christ, of "that One."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, in 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul speaks of the grace of Christ and of the love of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 3:7 Paul says that we become heirs according to the hope of eternal life, whereas in 1:1 and 2 he says that he became an apostle in the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This eternal life meant a great deal to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It also means a great deal to us as believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul became an apostle in the hope of eternal life, and we become heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why does Paul use the word "in" when speaking of himself and the word "according to" when speaking of us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fact that he used the word "in" with respect to himself indicates that he was already experiencing the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But because we have not yet entered into this experience to a very great extent, he says that we are heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a very matured believer, Paul was experiencing the hope already.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was in it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, for the most part, this experience lies ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we are heirs according to this hope.</S>
