the First Step in the Growth of Life</h2>
<p>Verses 20 and 21 say, &ldquo;God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven. And God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.&rdquo; Since there were light-bearers, God began to create animal life on the fifth day. This signifies that when the shining that we receive within is intensified and when the separation in our walk is more evident, the life of God in us will grow to a higher level.</p>
<p>The animal life is a higher life, possessing feeling and consciousness. The animal life can be divided into a few levels. The first level involves the animals in the water, such as fish. Although fish are the lowest form of animal life, their life is much higher than the plant life. The fish life is higher than the plant life because fish have more consciousness and feeling than plants and because fish can live in water. Trees and vegetables can grow on land, but fish can swim around and live in water. Therefore, the animal life in water is higher than the plant life.</p>
<p>This also applies to the growth of our spiritual life. The more life grows, the richer and stronger our feelings and consciousness becomes. Those who know the Bible know that the land symbolizes life and that water symbolizes death. When our spiritual life is young, we can grow only in an environment of life. We are unable to stand when we encounter an environment of death, because our spiritual life is not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the authority of death. However, as our spiritual life grows, our inner strength increases so that we are able to move around in an environment that is full of the power of death.</p>
<p>For example, even though many brothers and sisters have a heart to serve God, new believers are young and tender in their desire to serve; hence, they cannot bear any difficulties. If they are admired and encouraged, they serve energetically and are willing to give everything to the Lord. However, if they suffer difficulties, they immediately lose heart and can even stop coming to the meetings. Experienced brothers and sisters, however, serve whether they are praised, suffer difficulties, or are misunderstood. They are not affected by their environment but are able to stand firm.</p>
<p>These differences between young believers and experienced believers can be seen in the bread-breaking meeting. When the atmosphere of the bread-breaking meeting is fresh, lively, and full of the Spirit&rsquo;s operation, the young praise loudly; but when the atmosphere of the meeting is a little down, they are silent and do not know what to say. The experienced brothers and sisters, however, can still exercise their spirit in a deadened and down meeting, breaking through the pressing atmosphere and enlivening others from within.</p>
<p>These examples show that those who are young in the divine life grow only in an environment of life, but those who are experienced in life can move about in an environment of death. Such experienced brothers and sisters have the higher &ldquo;fish&rdquo; life.</p>

the Second Step in the Growth of Life</h2>
<p>On the fifth day God also created the second level of animal life, the bird life. This level of life is higher than the fish life, because it can transcend the encumbrances of the earth and is not limited by the earth; rather, it lives in a heavenly realm. Even in terms of consciousness, the bird life is higher than the fish life.</p>
<p>The steps of our spiritual growth in life develop in the same way. Our initial life is young, vague, and indefinite; it lacks consciousness and feeling and can live only in an environment of life. As the light of God&rsquo;s life becomes more solid and intensified in us, our spiritual life is uplifted and grows. It can be likened to the fish life that can grow even in an environment of death.</p>
<p>As our spiritual life continues to grow, we will manifest a transcendent condition that can be likened to the bird life. This means that although we are living on the earth, we are not of the earth and are not usurped by the things of the earth. Instead, we seek the things that are above. At this time, we have more growth in life.</p>

the Third Step in the Growth of Life</h2>
<p>Verses 24 and 25 say, &ldquo;God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so. And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.&rdquo; On the sixth day God created the third level of animal life, the animals of the earth. The animals of the earth have a higher level of life because they have a higher level of consciousness. This level of life also symbolizes further growth in our spiritual life, a growth that enables us to move on the earth, to serve God, and to work for God.</p>
<p>When our spiritual life grows to this level, we can truly work by life for God. Even though believers can and should serve God as soon as they are saved, their initial serving derives mainly from their abilities and methods. Believers who grow to the extent of being transcendent often only live an individual transcendent spiritual life. They are not able to work for God or to labor and serve others in harsh environments. It is easy for them to touch the Lord, to feel free, and to be at ease in personal prayer, but it is difficult for them to maintain this transcendent condition when things are busy outwardly. Such believers can only be Marys, not Marthas (Luke 10:38-40; John 12:2-3). In other words, they have only the bird life, not the life of the animals of the earth. Believers who have the life of the animals of the earth have both a personal spiritual life and a spiritual work before God. They can outwardly be as busy as Martha but inwardly be as quiet as Mary at the Lord&rsquo;s feet. Whether they are still or drawn about, alone or busy serving with others, they can live by life before God. Such believers have an even higher growth in life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
