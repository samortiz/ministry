   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If a person is narrow, his heart is narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to be a large person?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It means to be a person whose heart is large.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He may accomplish much without feeling anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He may enjoy much without undue concern about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason for this is that such a person is large.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For someone to feel all the time that he has accomplished something is a characteristic of smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A person who oversees God's people needs much wisdom, but the secret of wisdom is to have a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do want to spend quite a bit of time here with the brothers and sisters on the question of largeness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have no idea how much this matter affects those serving as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many of your inaccurate judgments are caused by your narrow heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the surface it appears that you lack wisdom, but actually, the problem comes because your heart is narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When many matters are poorly managed, you may attribute the cause to your foolishness, but actually your foolishness comes from your narrow heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you would only enlarge your heart, immediately you would become a person of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, brothers, learn to enlarge your heart in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For anyone to pretend to be large is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For anyone to strive to be large is presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should never behave in that way, but in dealing with any matter, we must learn to enlarge ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether in learning the truth, in seeking to be spiritual, in contacting the brothers and sisters, in discerning others, or in managing affairs, we must learn to be large.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we touch the affairs of the church and whenever we touch any spiritual matter, we have to learn to be large in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to continue to be large.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Largeness can solve many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose today everyone else in the church knows about a certain matter, but this matter is concealed from you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In your heart would you blame others?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If your heart is large, you will not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, you will surely complain about it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps a brother offends you today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are you able to let the matter go?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It depends on whether your heart is large or small.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely, if your heart is small, you will not be able to let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it is large, you will be able to let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything in the church can be governed by this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Between 1936 and 1937, for a year or two I worked frequently in a certain place in North China.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time there was a group of brothers who were all lovable ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Almost all of them loved the Lord, but the strange thing was that there was always trouble in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ones who stirred up the trouble were not other brothers and sisters, but the few responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During that period I visited there once nearly every three or four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each time I went, I would release a few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After releasing the messages, I would call the responsible brothers together to fellowship and pray, and to solve the problem among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But not too long after I left, trouble would arise again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I remember clearly that it was there that I first spoke on David being the typical example of one who had experienced the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord really gave me the light at that time, and I released some very strong words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The theme of the message that time touched on the point that a leading one must learn to choose and experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the message was given, these few leading brothers all praised and thanked the Lord, and they thought their problem was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They all prayed together and shook hands with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I left there with much joy, feeling very happy that the problem in their midst was over.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in less than two or three weeks, news came that they were having trouble again.</S>
