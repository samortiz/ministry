<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. Treasuring It</H2><P>The psalmist also treasured the word of God. He treasured it as much as all riches (v. 14), as great spoil (v. 162), better than gold and silver (vv. 72, 127), and as a heritage forever (v. 111).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>S. Treasuring It Up in Their Heart</H2><P>In verse 11 we are told that the psalmist treasured up God's word in his heart. Paul charged us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). We should not only memorize the word and keep it within us&#151;we should treasure it up in our heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>T. Remembering It and Not Forgetting It</H2><P>In Psalm 119:52 the psalmist indicates that he remembered God's word. If we treasure up the word in our heart, we will remember it; we will call back, or recall, our enjoyment of it. In verse 16b the writer declared, "I will not forget Your word," and in verse 93 he said, "I will never forget Your precepts,/For by them You have enlivened me."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>U. Standing in Awe of It</H2><P>In verse 161b the psalmist said, "My heart stands in awe of Your words." The psalmist also said that he was afraid of God's judgments (v. 120). Like the psalmist, we also should stand in awe of the word of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>V. Clinging to It</H2><P>In verse 31 the psalmist said to God, "I cling to Your testimonies." We also need to cling to the word of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>W. Not Forsaking It,<br>Not Swerving from It, Not Turning Aside from It,<br>and Not Going Astray from It</H2><P>Furthermore, the psalmist said that he did not forsake God's word, did not swerve from it, did not turn aside from it, and did not go astray from it (vv. 87, 51, 157, 102, 110).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>X. Turning Their Feet toward It</H2><P>"I considered my ways/And turned my feet toward Your testimonies" (v. 59). Instead of turning aside from the law, we, like the psalmist, should turn our feet toward it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Y. Keeping, Observing, and Doing It</H2><P>The psalmist kept, observed, and did the word of God (vv. 33, 69). All these different words show how he regarded the word of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Z. Walking in It and Running the Way of It</H2><P>Verse 1 says, "Blessed are those whose way is perfect,/Who walk in the law of Jehovah." Verse 32a says, "I run the way of Your commandments." The psalmist walked in the word of God and ran the way of the word of God. This indicates that he lived according to the word of God.</P><P>These twenty-six items reveal the attitude of the God-seekers toward God's law as God's testimony and as God's word.</P>
