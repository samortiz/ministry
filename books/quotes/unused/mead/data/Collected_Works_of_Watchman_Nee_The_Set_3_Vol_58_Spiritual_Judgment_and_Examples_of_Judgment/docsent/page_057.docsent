   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 37 Date:August 14, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER H. G.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In my youth I considered Christianity to be a cultural invasion by the Western world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the age of sixteen I went to Shanghai to study and began to attend the Apostolic Faith Church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There I saw many people healed of their sicknesses, and demons were cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I began to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1925 I was baptized, but I did not know that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After I believed in the Lord, I immediately went to the streets to pass out gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was the happiest thing I had done in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I also enjoyed visiting various places and listening to different preachings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later I went to Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, in Shanghai and attended meetings there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Spiritual things became real to me, and I stopped going to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I also saw that denominationalism is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After I met Sister Peace Wang, I became clear concerning the matter of the breaking of bread for the remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once in my prayer, the Lord rebuked me for loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although I said in my prayer that I did not love the world, I still loved it in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had beautiful clothes in my room which I could not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I prayed to the Lord to deliver me from the love for beautiful clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was merciful to me and heard my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was able to free myself from it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I am no longer bothered by such things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once, I read in Acts 9 about God's selection of His own vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words of that chapter suddenly enlarged before my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seemed as if the Lord had chosen me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet I was not willing to answer His choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was afraid, and I told Him, "I am satisfied to be an ordinary believer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not want to be a preacher."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once, I passed through a trial.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was wrongly accused and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that time forward, God began to strip me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He dealt with my playing of the piano and my love for food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Last summer I became weak, and by fall I was laid up in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As I lay on my bed one day, I realized that everything was vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I began to let go of everything, and I was willing to go along with the discipline of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I dropped all my spiritual plans and told God, "If You want me to be weak, I am willing to be weak."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After that I was at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time I felt that I could never be one with God, but now I believe that I will be one with Him one day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After resting on my bed for a few months, I heard that there was going to be a special conference on April 9 of this year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I wrote to Brother Nee and told him that I would get out of bed to attend this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I told him, "I will be the first one to hand myself over."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That night I was so overjoyed that I could not sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After that I continued to attend meetings until I came to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the mountain I saw that I have none of the things that I should have, and I am full of all the things that I should not have.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am extremely sad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have shed more tears during the past two weeks than in my entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day as I was praying, I saw my failures as well as the failures of the brothers and sisters and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I became very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In my fellowship with the Lord, I heard one word: "God has put Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is the only vessel that expresses Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I saw this, my tears began to dry up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man can fail, but the church can never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our sister is on the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God wants us to know who is doing all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today there are many mixtures in the Lord's work, and sometimes we cannot tell which work is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God Himself wants to do all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only then will He get all the results and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whoever does the work will get the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God cannot say, "It is My work, yet the glory goes to you."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is like one fighting the battle, while another receives the medal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is just as jealous for His work as He is for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Any possibility of misunderstanding in the work will produce a possibility of misunderstanding in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unless God does all the work, He cannot get all the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God does not allow a little of man's hand in His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, He has to bring us to the point where His work has nothing more to do with you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must learn to see that no work belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once we relax, we become proud and give glory to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Lord's work, all artificial props have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have to fall so utterly that we do not have any strength to even lift a finger.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A brother once said, "I have to ask the Lord to cleanse with His blood the tears which I shed for my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This shows us that even our tears for sins can be impure in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before a man has fallen completely, the Lord cannot have a way through him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A Christian must have clear knowledge and discernment about one thing: Who is doing the work?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are not careful, we will end up being the one who does the work, and we will become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The cross in 2 Corinthians 13 has to do with weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In His work God requires that we become weak with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to be so weakened that we could not be proud even if we tried.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is a good sign when God's children are led to such weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is good when they cannot even stand up on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the wound a man suffers is deep enough, he will not need to try to remember anything; the Holy Spirit will remind him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we still need the help of our memory in practicing such things as humility, patience, and obedience, it proves that the dealings we have received are not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we need to exercise our memory to remember to love, that love is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we need to exercise our memory to remember to be patient, that patience is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we need our memory for our humility, that humility is not reliable as well.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Peter became so fallen and defeated that he dared not even confess his love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He had no confidence in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When the Lord tested him, he failed completely.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His fall was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>His stubbornness, confidence, and everything fell.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He became truly weak.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Such a weakness is kept in the memory of the Holy Spirit; Peter no longer had to rely on his own memory.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A big wound was there.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He had truly become weak.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>His fall was a fall of his very life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After this he could only work by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Not even an ounce of energy could come from him; from that point forward, every work belonged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to be so weakened in the work that no one will be confused as to who is working.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Even if the work is very small, it will be apparent to everyone that this work is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We will no longer have the slightest thought that we are doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have to be enlightened by the Lord to see our total uselessness and to see that not even the slightest work originates from us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have to acknowledge wholeheartedly, "I am like a dead dog in the Lord's work."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The principle of work is the principle of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Without death there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Man always wants the Lord to make up his lack.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But this principle is basically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord's principle is first death, then resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We have to know that we are dead already and that we need the Lord to resurrect us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Resurrection comes only when we see our utter uselessness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only then will we give glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When this happens, humility will be a spontaneous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If our humility is something that we can forget, it proves that there is still self effort in our humility and that we have not fallen enough.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The goal of humility is that we give all the glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We must forever be conscious that we are totally useless.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Our sister has to pay attention to another thing: Your prayer must be like your speaking, which means that the words must match the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is different from what I said about the other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>With him, his speaking should be the same as his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>With you, your prayer should be as restricted as your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When we speak, we know how to restrict ourselves; we know how to hold ourselves back.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>You should learn to hold back yourself in prayer and to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If you do, you will touch reality, and you will touch something powerful in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Your spirit will match your word.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I believe the Lord will be gracious to you.</S>
