<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OUTPOURING OF THE SEVEN BOWLS<br>(Revelation 15:1—16:21)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LAST SEVEN PLAGUES<br>(REVELATION 15:1)</H2><P>"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished." </P><P>In 12:1 there was "a great sign." Here in 15:1 there is a "great and wonderful" sign.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. PRAISE<br>(REVELATION 15:2-4)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 15:2</H2><P>"And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire and those who come away victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God."</P><P>A "glassy sea" was mentioned before in 4:6; however, neither the people nor the fire were mentioned there. In 4:6 the glassy sea is before the throne; that is, it is in the heavens. Hence, "standing on the glassy sea" in 15:2 indicates that these people have been raptured to the throne in heaven. This portion of the Bible tells us that these people have passed through the great tribulation and have encountered the beast, the image of the beast, and the number of the beast. Revelation 14:4-16 shows us a perspective of the rapture by God as seen from the earth. Revelation 15:2 shows us the perspective as seen from heaven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 15:3</H2><P>"And they sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!"</P><P>Why does it not say, "They sing the song of the Lamb," and then, "the song of Moses"? Why do they sing "the song of Moses...and the song of the Lamb"? If they had worshipped the image of the beast, they would have broken the law of Moses and violated the commandment of God. But they did not do this; therefore, they sing the song of Moses. The one who gave the commandment not to worship idols was Moses; hence, they sing the song of Moses. The one who empowered them so that they would not worship the idols was the Lamb (13:8); hence, they sing the song of the Lamb. What they sing is clearly recorded in Revelation 15:3-4. This is not the song sung by Moses in Exodus 15. (Since 15:3 clearly mentions the name of Moses, this seems to indicate that Moses is not one of the witnesses in 11:3.)</P><P>The first phrase of this song is concerning God's works. The second is concerning God's ways. "Works" are only outward, but "ways" are inward principles. "Lord God" is the name used for God when He has a relationship with man. "Righteous" is related to His principles. "True" is related to His promises.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 15:4</H2><P>"Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous judgments have been manifested." </P><P>"Holy" pertains to God's nature. "Righteous judgments" are the principles of God's work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE TEMPLE OF THE TABERNACLE<br>(REVELATION 15:5-8)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 15:5</H2><P>"And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened."</P><P>"The temple of the tabernacle," though in the heavens, is still not eternal because it is the temple of the tabernacle. Moses built the tabernacle according to the heavenly pattern (Heb. 8:5), but when the temple was built, the tabernacle was done away with. Similarly, in eternity, when the Lamb becomes the temple, this temple of the tabernacle in the heavens will also be annulled. Revelation 15:5—16:18 and 16:21 are the amplification of 11:18.</P>
