   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Stewardship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In dispensing anything, you need a steward to take care of the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This taking care of the dispensing is a stewardship, a kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God is dispensing Himself into His chosen people, He uses the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of the apostles are stewards, but they are not taking care of U.S. dollars, British pound sterling, or French francs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are taking care of God in Christ as a mystery dispensed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostles are stewards dispensing Christ as the mystery of God to the Jews and to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The stewardship is just one aspect, the dispensing service, of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Administration</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first aspect of God's economy is dispensing, the second is stewardship, and the third is administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you dispense anything, you need the service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To carry out the service, you need a kind of administration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The one word economy in Greek implies dispensing, stewardship, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of us were saved in an accidental way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our feeling, our conversion might have been an accident, but it was actually part of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's economy He wanted to dispense Himself into His called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that we are one of the many!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our conversion was a part of God's dispensing, and this dispensing was carried out by the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has given this stewardship to some of His chosen ones, such as the apostles who have been much used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through their kind of ministry, this dispensing got into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, our conversion was a part of God's dispensing, and this was carried out by the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Right after our being converted, we were under the administration of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This administration is a part of the economy, and now we all are in this wonderful administration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every meeting there is the dispensing, the stewardship, and the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we meet together, the more we fellowship, the more dispensing we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, the more that we are in the stewardship, the more we are under the administration to carry out God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This mystery eventually is just the very embodiment, reality, and expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah, we are the mystery of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among us we have God's economy, and God's economy is just to carry out God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we meet together we have God's dispensing, we have the stewardship, and we are under the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then, the reality of God, the embodiment of God, and the expression of God will be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think that one day when we get into the New Jerusalem we will be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we get there, we will have been in this for years and years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even now we are in the foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Jerusalem is just God's expression, God's administration, God's stewardship, and God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is altogether God's economy, and this economy is the economy of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are here enjoying the dispensing of God, the stewardship of God, and the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we are the reality, the embodiment, and the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise Him!</S>
