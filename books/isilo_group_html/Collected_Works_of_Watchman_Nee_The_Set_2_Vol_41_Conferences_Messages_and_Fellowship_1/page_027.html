Once I am changed, everything will be fine." I said, "Your hope can never be realized." He said, "You do not know me. How do you know that there is no hope in me?" I said, "I knew you long ago. Before you were born, I knew you already. What are you? You are hopelessness itself. God has said in the Bible that there is no hope in you. If there were some hope in you, God would not have crucified you. The cross is God's valuation of you. It means that you only deserve to die. You are worthy of nothing but death. You should die, and you must die. You are absolutely useless. God was not mistreating you when He crucified you. You say that you want to change, but I say that you can never change for the better. You can never improve. This hope can never be realized. It does not matter how much a cow changes; it will still be a cow. It does not matter how much a pig changes; it will still be a pig. No matter how much you change, you will still be yourself. You want to change. But let me say something to you. Add the letters e and x to the word change and make it exchange. What you need is not a change, but an exchange."</p><p>No matter how much I, Watchman Nee, change, the life within me will always be the life of a sinner. God's way of salvation and His method of deliverance is not changing what is evil and weak within me into something that is good and powerful. God's way of salvation is to set me aside. Henceforth, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me. God has exchanged my life for the life of Christ. It is not a change, but an exchange. God put Christ within us so that He would live instead of us. This is victory. A man may have a bad temper, but God's way of salvation is not to change his bad temper. His way of salvation is to put Christ within him so that Christ becomes his patience and meekness. God intends that Christ be our sanctification, righteousness, humility, patience, etc. This means that everything is Christ. It is Christ who is everything to us. This is the meaning of victory.</p><p>Victory is something that God gives to us; it is not something we strive to attain. Many people read only the letter of the Bible but do not understand the reality behind the letter of the Word. They do not understand what Galatians 2:20 means. Over ten years ago, when I was first saved, someone read me a story about a little eight-year-old girl. She was saved and had the excellent experience of overcoming sin, and she knew what victory meant to her. During a meeting at the Keswick Convention, someone asked how she would overcome when temptation came. She answered, "Every time temptation comes, I will not speak to it, I will not fight against it, and I will not ask it to go away. When Satan knocks on my door, I tell the Lord, `Lord, You open the door for me.' When Satan hears the Lord opening the door, he will say, `Sir, sorry, I have knocked on the wrong door,' and he will turn and run away immediately." The first time I heard this story, I smiled like you do today. At that time, even though I knew that the little girl was right, I did not know how right she was because I did not have the experience yet. During the past few years, I have learned this secret of overcoming sin. The secret is for Christ to deal with the sins instead of dealing with them myself. I do not need to resist sins; Christ resists them for me. I do not have to fight against temptations; Christ fights against them for me. I do not have to reject Satan; Christ rejects him for me. I do not have to overcome sin; Christ overcomes it for me. I do not have to exercise patience; Christ becomes my patience for me. I do not have to be pure and humble; Christ is my purity and humility.</p><p>The Son of God is in me; Christ is in me. This is my victory, and this is my everything. I cannot help but praise Him. The Son of God was willing to die on the cross for me. Today He is willing to live within me. He is sitting on the throne in heaven, but at the same time, He is also living within me. God has given His Son's life to us for this very purpose. He has set aside man's life and put His Son's life within us. Our living and our everything depends on Christ. Many people think that as long as they receive a package of patience, humility, or love from heaven everything will be solved. But we have to realize that God's salvation in Christ is a wholesale transaction instead of a retail transaction. We do not need to ask for a little today and a little tomorrow. He has put everything within us once and for all.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT BEING CHRIST</h2><p>Many people say that there are nine kinds of fruit of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5:22 and 23. They think that the Holy Spirit has nine different kinds of fruit and that we take in this fruit one by one. This is like saying that we first take in a fruit called love. Now love is within us, but we do not have joy yet. So we move on and take in another fruit called joy. After we have joy, we move on to take in peace. But there is not such a thing. We have to realize that the word fruit in the phrase the fruit of the Spirit is singular in the original language. There is only one fruit of the Holy Spirit. Love, joy, peace, endurance, etc. are all part of the one fruit of the Spirit. Once we have the fruit of the Spirit, we have all nine virtues. If we do not have the fruit of the Spirit, we do not have any of the nine virtues. We cannot say that we have one kind but are short of the other eight. If we have one, we have all. If we are short of one, we are short of all. Christ is the fruit of the Spirit. When we receive Christ into us, we have the entire fruit of the Spirit.</p><p>We often ask what the fruit of the Spirit is. But God asks who the fruit of the Spirit is. The fruit of the Spirit is just Christ Himself. When we have Christ, we have the fruit of the Spirit. If we have Christ, we have everything. In the eyes of God, we do not obtain these things item by item. Rather, we obtain the whole Christ once for all. Once we have Christ, we have the fruit of the Spirit. Many people have tried to buy a little grace from God here and there. The result is nothing but failure. Let me ask: You have been praying for patience for a long time, but have you received it yet? Christ is in us as our life, and He is living for us. What else do we need? Once we see that Christ is our life and that He is living for us, we will immediately have all the grace that we need. The Chinese have an expression: "As long as the green mountain remains, there is no fear that one will run out of wood for fire." Christ is our "green mountain," and the nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are the trees growing on this "mountain." If we want to be overcoming in our lives, our eyes have to be set continually on Christ.</p><p>The kind of Christians that God is after are not those who imitate Christ or those who have received a little power here and there. The kind of Christians that God is after are those who will set aside themselves and allow Christ to live instead of them. With this replacement, there will be the proper walk. When Christ lives for us and within us, we become Christ, and we can overcome. Otherwise, we will not live Christ, and we will not overcome no matter how we live. Victory is Christ becoming everything within us and living for us. This is the overcoming life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
