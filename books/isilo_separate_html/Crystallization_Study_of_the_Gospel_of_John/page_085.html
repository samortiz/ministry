Verse 17b shows that the Spirit of reality is in us, and verse 20 says that the Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, and the Son is in us. We have said that these four ins show the Triune God coinhering with us, and this coinhering is an incorporation.</P><P>We also need to see that the in in verse 17 is the consummation of the three ins in verse 20. The all-inclusive, compounded, life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. The word consummation means the totality. The life-giving Spirit is the totality of the Triune God. Therefore, His being in us equals the Triune God's being in us, and the Triune God's being in us is in verse 20. Christ is in the Father and we are in Christ, so we also are in the Father. Christ is in us and because He is in the Father, the Father is also in us. Christ is the centrality and universality of the Divine Trinity because He is the embodiment of the Father and He is realized as the Spirit. The Spirit of reality is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. His being in us equals the Triune God's being in us. Actually, there are only three ins, because the Spirit being in us is the totality of the three ins in verse 20. The Spirit enters into us as the reality of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. In other words, He enters into us as the totality of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SKETCH OF JOHN 1 THROUGH 16</H2><P>Now I would like to give another short, simple sketch of the first sixteen chapters of John. The beginning of the Gospel of John unveils that God is the Word (1:1). This means that God speaks, and speaking means definition, explanation, and expression. Expression includes spreading and dispensing. The more someone speaks, the more he is spreading and dispensing himself into others. Speaking spreads and dispenses.</P><P>In the Word there is life and the life is the light (v. 4). Life is hidden but light expresses. The light shining equals the Word speaking for spreading and dispensing. Chapter one of John also mentions the Spirit (v. 32). The Spirit is for speaking and for shining, so the Spirit is the totality of God's spreading and dispensing. God's spreading and dispensing are through His being the Word and the light. The Word and the light added together equal the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> </body></html>
