Bearing the Cross in the Steps of Christ</H2><P>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me." This is to live a life of bearing the cross in the steps of Christ (1 Pet. 2:21b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Dying to Themselves and Living to God</H2><P>Both 2 Corinthians 5:15 and Galatians 2:19 show that the believers in Christ should die to themselves and live to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Crucified with Christ to Be Conformed<br>to His Death by the Power of His Resurrection</H2><P>Paul said that he was crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20) to be conformed to His death by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Putting to Death the Practices of the Body<br>by the Spirit in Resurrection</H2><P>Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live." You have to put to death by the Spirit in His resurrection whatever your body does. This is to be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection. No one in his natural life can put everything that his body does to death. But we, the God-men, who are the reproduction of the prototype, can. We can know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. For Christ, the First God-man,<br>to Be Formed in His Many Brothers</H2><P>Such a life of dying to ourselves and living to God is for Christ, the first God-man, to be formed in His many brothers, the many God-men, for the building up of His organic Body that the eternal economy of God might be carried out. The Christian life is not a matter of outwardly loving people or of being meek or patient in our human ethics. We need to die every day (1 Cor. 15:31). The married saints need to die to their spouse. The students need to die to their classmates and teachers. We need to die to live so that the many God-men can become the building material for the building up of the Body of Christ to carry out God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Constituted to Be His Overcomers</H2><P>Thus, a number (not all) of His brothers, the many God-men, through His death and in His resurrection may be constituted to be His overcomers to close this age and to bring in His kingdom age. This is the real meaning of our being a Christian. It is a life of dying every day. We must admit that we have not been that absolute or faithful in practicing this dying-to-live life. God has opened up to us the high peak of His divine revelation. He also puts us in an environment of sufferings to force us to die to live. I hope we all would be brought into the reality of Philippians 3:10: "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
