   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Never Having God's Appearing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lot never had God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I read through the verses about Lot again and again, I could not find a hint that God ever appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although God and the two angels visited Abraham, only the two angels came to Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does this mean that God is unfair or a respecter of persons?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is fair and is no respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not follow God in a direct way but in an indirect way and did not walk in the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unlike Abraham, Lot had no direct relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not respect persons, but He does respect behavior, respecting whether or not we are active or passive in seeking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you seek Him, He will appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you do not seek Him, He will not waste His time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That God did not appear to Lot was not God's fault; it was Lot's. God wants to appear to you, but are you seeking Him and walking in His way? Do you have a heart to seek God positively and actively and walk in the way of God? If you do, God will not fail you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will certainly appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>c Never Taking the Initiative</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>in Taking God's Way</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lot never took the initiative in taking God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been unable to find a verse which indicates that Lot ever took the initiative in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible says that Lot's grandfather took him to Haran; it does not say that Lot followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am somewhat concerned for the young people among us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of them are in the church life because someone brought them here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They did not take the initiative to come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As I look back upon the past fifty years, I can testify that those who showed initiative in taking the way of the church are still strong today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, those who took no initiative but who were passively brought into the way of the church have gradually fallen away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can give you a hundred names of those who were intimate with me and who were helped by my ministry who gradually fell away because they did not have a strong start by actively taking the initiative to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lot should have said to Abraham, "Uncle Abraham, whether or not you take God's way, I will take it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though I am younger than you, I would be the leader in following God and would ask you to follow me."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To say this is not to be proud; it is to be active.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>d His Relationship with God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being under the Influence of Others</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lot's relationship with God was under the influence of others 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When others were up, he was up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they were down, he was down.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lot was like a piece of driftwood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When his spiritual leader drifted into Egypt, he drifted there after him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was altogether under the influence of others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Abraham was drifting southward toward Egypt and the world, Lot should have withstood him and said, "Abraham, if you go downward, I'll go upward."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we see no such tendency in Lot's life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am concerned that in the church life today there is this kind of driftwood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Is your relationship with God under His direct appearing or under others' influence?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not think that Lot suddenly drifted into Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, it was a gradual development starting from a very weak beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If as you read this message you feel that you have not had a strong beginning, be encouraged for it is still not too late to lay a solid foundation.</S>
