[1]  How we thank the Lord that He has afforded us this training, a training that will cover the normal Christian life with the proper church life.
[2]  We will pay our full attention to this matter of life the Christian life and the church life.
[3]  This means that our purpose is not to have a training in doctrines, although we still need to know the basic truths and the principles from the divine Word.
[4]  God as the Husband and His People as the Wife
[5]  Many times the prophets spoke of God as the Husband and of His people as His wife.
[6]  Now we need to consider this romance as it is portrayed in the New Testament.
[7]  There is no doubt that the gospels give us a full record of Christ as our Savior.
[8]  As we have pointed out on previous occasions, in chapter 1 of Matthew we see that Christ is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, and also Emmanuel, God with us.
[9]  At this point we need to consider the sections of the book of Romans.
[10]  The Lord has given us eight words to denote the eight sections of this book: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, transformation, and conclusion.
[11]  The next section in the book of Romans is glorification Rom 8:14-39 , unveiling the purpose of God s salvation.
[12]  The little Jesus has been processed and designated as the Son of God, and we also are in the same process to be designated as the many sons of God.
[13]  Christians are accustomed to saying that there are four gospels, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[14]  The gospel in the first four books of the New Testament concerns Christ in the flesh as He lived among His disciples before His death and resurrection.
[15]  This is a clear reference to Christ s divinity.
[16]  Paul mentions Christ s humanity first because he maintains the sequence of Christ s process.
[17]  As a divine Person Christ was the Son of God before His incarnation, but that part of Him which was Jesus with the flesh, the human nature, born of Mary, was not the Son of God.
[18]  In the book of Romans Paul argues that whatever we do toward God must be done in our spirit, that whatever we are must be in spirit, and that whatever we have must be in spirit.
[19]  The called ones receive the gospel of God through the obedience of faith 1:5 .
[20]  Under the law of Moses, God gave people ten commandments to obey.
[21]  In this age of grace, God has given us one, unique commandment to believe in Jesus.
[22]  Grace is God in Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment, and peace is the issue of the enjoyment of God s grace.
[23]  The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel out of faith and to faith 1:17 , meaning that as long as we have the faith, we have the righteousness of God.
[24]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THREE THE SOURCE OF WICKEDNESS
[25]  In this message we will cover the source of wickedness shown in the condemnation of mankind and the way of restriction shown in the condemnation of the self-righteous.
[26]  In the ancient times man knew God, but did not glorify Him as God.
[27]  Next, we need to do things according to our nature 2:14 .
[28]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FOUR THE VANITY OF RELIGION
[29]  In this message we will cover the vanity of religion shown in the condemnation on the religious 2:17 3:8 and the totality of hopelessness shown in the condemnation of all the world 3:9-20 .
[30]  As we have pointed out, Paul deals with condemnation in four aspects: on mankind in general, on the self-righteous in particular, on the religious specifically, and on all the world totally.
[31]  From these aspects of God s condemnation we can see four things: the source of wickedness, the way of restriction, the vanity of religion, and the totality of hopelessness.
[32]  Now we need to consider a few matters about the vanity of religion.
[33]  Religion is vanity because it lacks inward reality in spirit 2:29 .
[34]  Romans 2:29 says that whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must all be in spirit.
[35]  If you are a Jew and are circumcised, your circumcision must be in spirit.
[36]  Now we come to the section on justification, a most significant doctrine 3:21-5:11 .
[37]  Martin Luther was raised up by God to wage a fierce battle over justification because it is such a great doctrine in the Bible.
[38]  However, we first need to consider the righteousness of God.
[39]  Justification is God s action in approving people according to His standard of righteousness.
[40]  The expiation in the Old Testament was a type of the propitiation in the New Testament.
[41]  In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 we are told that Christ, the Son of God, is Himself the propitiation for our sins.
[42]  Bible students have great difficulty with the phrase faith of Jesus Christ 3:22 .
[43]  Some say that it means our act of believing in Jesus Christ.
[44]  Others argue that it refers to the faith of Jesus, that the faith of Jesus becomes ours.
[45]  We believe in Jesus Christ by His faith, for we have no faith of our own.
[46]  The exposing and condemning law signified the requirements of God s righteousness according to the law, and the observing cherubim signified the requirements of God s glory according to the expression of God.
[47]  Although many Christians love the Lord Jesus and realize that He is so much to them, they may not know that Christ is a propitiation place where God can meet with us and where we can contact God.
[48]  HAVING BEEN SHOWN A. To the Old Testament Saints
[49]  The righteousness of God was shown to the Old Testament saints in God s passing by their sins.
[50]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIX THE EXAMPLE OF JUSTIFICATION
[51]  I love the book of Romans because it was written in a solid and substantial way.
[52]  Although this book covers many doctrines, it was actually written according to facts and experiences.
[53]  He had abandoned everything and had no way to go on except to trust in God.
[54]  His resurrection is a proof that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death and in Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God.
[55]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SEVEN THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
[56]  If we enter into the depths of this chapter, we will see it reveals that adequate, living justification is God s deeper work in calling fallen people out of everything other than God and bringing them back to Himself.
[57]  The meaning of the fall of man is to be kept from God by anything that is not God.
[58]  The common understanding of justification among most Christians is this: we are sinful, God is righteous and holy, and there is no way for us to contact Him or for Him to contact us.
[59]  Thus, Christ died on the cross and accomplished redemption by shedding His blood.
[60]  Under His blood we are redeemed, and God has a righteous position to justify us.
[61]  In Romans 3 we see redemption bringing forth God s justification, but we do not see God s purpose.
[62]  According to Genesis 15:6, Abraham believed God s word about his seed being as the stars of heaven, and God reckoned Abraham s faith as righteousness.
[63]  Although Abraham received God s righteousness at that time, he did not realize very much about it.
[64]  When Paul wrote the book of Romans, he must have had the Old Testament in view.
[65]  God, as the heavenly electricity, comes to His chosen ones.
[66]  For example, God came to Abraham by appearing to him.
[67]  If we study Genesis 11 through 24, including the record in Acts 7, we find that God appeared to Abraham several times.
[68]  This divine word in the Bible is deep, and we are unable to understand it if we only read superficially.
[69]  Although righteousness had been reckoned to Abraham, he had not yet experienced that righteousness in a solid, concrete way.
[70]  Likewise, we may have Christ as our righteousness without actually experiencing Him in a substantial way.
[71]  At the moment we called on Him, we received Christ, and Christ was made our righteousness.
[72]  We may summarize the process this way: in His appearing and transfusion Christ became our faith to God, and in return Christ became God s righteousness to us.
[73]  Then God may appear again and ask, Are you willing to go on with Me?
[74]  Do not cast Isaac away, but offer him up to Me. Bring the very Christ whom you have experienced, lay Him on My altar, and offer Him to Me that I may be satisfied.
[75]  At the end of Romans 3, Paul gives the definition of justification in God s way and in chapter four he presents Abraham as the example of this justification.
[76]  The love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit v. 5 . We have access into this grace in which we stand v. 2 . Since we have been justified by faith we have peace toward God v. 1 . Following this, we boast, exult, and glory in hope v. 2 . Verse 10 tells us that we shall be saved in His life.
[77]  Finally, we expect to share the glory of God v. 2 . These six items are part of the result of God s justification.
[78]  Romans 5:2 says, We have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand.
[79]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TEN THE GIFT IN CHRIST SURPASSING
[80]  If we read the book of Romans carefully, we will observe that the section on justification ends with Romans 5:11.
[81]  This means that in the first part of Romans we mainly have two sections, condemnation and justification.
[82]  Originally, we were full of sin and needed the redemption of Christ as a base upon which God can justify us.
[83]  As a result of justification, we have love, grace, peace, hope, life, glory, God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit.
[84]  These two men have two acts, and the two acts have brought forth two results.
[85]  Romans 5:19 tells us, through the obedience of the One shall the many be constituted righteous.
[86]  We are not only righteous; we are constituted righteous.
[87]  We have seen two men, two acts, and two results.
[88]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE ELEVEN IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST
[89]  Romans 5:12 marks a major turn in Paul s writing in the book of Romans.
[90]  As we have already pointed out, this turn is a turn from sins to sin, from position to disposition, and from justification to sanctification, or we may say from salvation to life.
[91]  We have been brought out of that fallen state into the realm of grace, where we may enjoy God.
[92]  When we come to Romans 6, we must use our spiritual mathematics to do some accounting work v. 11 . Since we have been crucified with Christ and resurrected with Him, we must make an entry of this fact into our accounting book, that is, we must reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God.
[93]  Since we all were born in Adam, how can we say that we are now in Christ?
[94]  In Romans 6:3 Paul says, Are you ignorant that as many of us as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
[95]  In Romans 5 we were born in Adam and were constituted sinners.
[96]  In Romans 6 we have been baptized into Christ and we have been identified with His death and resurrection.
[97]  If we have seen these two aspects of the fact of our identification with Christ, we know that we are dead to sin and alive to God.
[98]  As we reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God, we need to present our members as weapons of righteousness to God 6:13 .
[99]  This is the order of our experience: we see, we reckon, we present ourselves to God, we reject sin, and we cooperate with God.
[100]  At the same time, by taking sides with Christ, we present ourselves and our members as slaves to God that the divine life may work within us to sanctify us, not only positionally, but also dispositionally, with the holy nature of God.
[101]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWELVE THE BONDAGE OF THE LAW IN OUR FLESH 1
[102]  In Romans 5:12-21 we saw that the gift in Christ surpasses the heritage in Adam.
[103]  In order to have a genuine experience of our identification with Christ, we must pay attention to two negative items found in Romans 7 the law and the flesh.
[104]  Although we have been identified with Christ through baptism, and although we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death and are now growing together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, the law and the flesh continue to exist.
[105]  We may present ourselves as slaves and our members as weapons of righteousness to God that we may be sanctified and enjoy the riches of the divine life, yet the law of God outside of us and our flesh within us still exist.
[106]  Since fallen man wanted to be the husband, God gave him the law.
[107]  The law is not intended for the wife, but for the fallen husband.
[108]  However, God did not intend that the old man keep the law, because the old man cannot keep it.
[109]  The regenerated man, having the old man crucified, is now free from the law of the old man Rom 7:3, 4, 6; Gal 2:19 .
[110]  When we were in the flesh that is, when we were the old husband everything related to us was death.
[111]  Therefore, in these verses we see a vivid contrast between death and God, between bearing fruit to death and bearing fruit to God.
[112]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE BONDAGE OF THE LAW IN OUR FLESH 2 II.
[113]  In the previous message we saw the two husbands revealed in Romans 7:1-6.
[114]  But I had not known sin except through the law; for I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet v. 7 . This verse makes it quite clear that the law gives us the knowledge of sin, for the law exposes sin and identifies it as sin.
[115]  However, in our members is a third law, the law of sin, which wars against the law of good.
[116]  As we have seen, the law of sin is in the members of our fallen body, the flesh vv.
[117]  It constantly wars against the law of good and makes man a captive v. 23 . Whenever the law of good responds to the law of God and attempts to fulfill the requirements of the law of God, the evil law in our flesh is aroused.
[118]  However, when the evil law learns that the good law is responding, the evil law seems to say, Are you going to practice good according to the law of God?
[119]  In Romans 7 we see three laws: the first law, the law of God, demands and makes requirements; the second law, the law of good in our mind, is quick to respond; the third law, the law of sin in our members, is always on the alert to war against the law of good in our minds and to defeat us, capture us, and imprison us.
[120]  The body of death means that the body is poisoned, weakened, paralyzed, and deadened, unable to keep the law and to do good to please God.
[121]  We need to realize that we, as the old man, have been crucified with Christ and that, as the new man, we are freed from the old man s law and have been married to our new husband, the resurrected Christ, that we might bear fruit to God and serve the Lord in newness of spirit.
[122]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE FREEDOM OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT 1 I. THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE
[123]  In chapter five of Romans we saw that the gift in Christ surpasses the heritage in Adam, in chapter six we were shown our identification with Christ, and in chapter seven we found the bondage of the law in our flesh.
[124]  In Romans 7 we have bondage; in Romans 8 we have freedom.
[125]  The word life is used four times in chapter eight.
[126]  Romans 8:2 mentions the law of the Spirit of life.
[127]  Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life.
[128]  In Romans 8:9, 10 we are told that if Christ is in us our spirit is life because of righteousness.
[129]  The first time life is mentioned in this chapter it is connected to the Holy Spirit, the second time it is related to our mind, the third time it is associated with our spirit, and the fourth time it is a matter of our body.
[130]  Paul shows us that outside of us is the law of God with its demands, that in our soul is the law of good responding to God s law, and that in the members of our body is another law that wars against the good law in our soul.
[131]  We are complicated people, for we have four laws related to us.
[132]  In our mind is the law of good responding to the law of God.
[133]  We have three parts to our being, and each part has a person: in our body, sin, that is, Satan dwells; in our soul, our self dwells; and in our spirit, the processed God as the Spirit of life dwells.
[134]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE FREEDOM OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT 2
[135]  In this message we shall continue our consideration of Romans 8:1-6.
[136]  As we have seen, Romans 8 is a sharp contrast to Romans 7.
[137]  In Romans 7 we see the bondage of the law in our flesh, and in Romans 8 we see the freedom of the Spirit in our spirit.
[138]  As we come to chapter eight, we turn from bondage in the flesh to freedom in the Spirit.
[139]  We see the objective condemnation of God in the early chapters of Romans, for example in 3:19 which says that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become subject to the judgment of God.
[140]  Without Christ, or outside of Christ, he struggled according to the law in his mind to keep the law of God in order that he might please God, but he was totally defeated by the law of sin.
[141]  Paul had no condemnation because in Christ he did not need to keep the law of God by himself, an effort which produced self-condemnation; no condemnation because in Christ he had the law of the Spirit of life which is more powerful than the law of sin and which set him free from the law of sin; no condemnation now, not because of the redeeming blood of Christ which removed the objective condemnation of God, but because of the law of the Spirit of life which brought in the freedom of the Spirit in his spirit and which broke through all his subjective condemnation; and no condemnation because he was freed from both the law of God and the law of sin.
[142]  B. The Freedom of the Law of the Spirit of Life
[143]  In Romans 8 Paul does not say, There is no condemnation in Christ Jesus because the blood of Jesus has cleansed me.
[144]  This kind of condemnation is not dealt with by the blood.
[145]  We are freed from subjective condemnation, not because of the blood which cleanses us, but because of the law which liberates us.
[146]  Although we have the law of God outside of us demanding, the law of good in our mind agreeing with the law of God, and the law of sin in our body warring against and defeating the law of good, we must nevertheless praise the Lord that in our spirit is the law of the Spirit of life.
[147]  Romans 8:3 says, For what is impossible to the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.
[148]  This verse says that there is an impossibility related to the law, referring not to the law of the Spirit of life, with which there is no impossibility, but to the law of God outside of us.
[149]  There is an impossibility associated with the law of God because that law is weak through the flesh.
[150]  Romans 8:4 says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.
[151]  The fact that 8:3 ends with a comma indicates that what was accomplished in that verse is for the following verse.
[152]  God condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us.
[153]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE FREEDOM OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT 3 III.
[154]  Although in Romans 8:1-6 we clearly see the freedom of the law of the Spirit of life, it is difficult to see the central point of the next seven verses.
[155]  However, if we enter deep into the thought of this portion, we will see that in it Paul is trying to tell us that something other than sin has its lodging within us.
[156]  In 7:20 Paul said, But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.
[157]  Christ not only imparts life to our spirit v. 10 , but also to our minds v. 6 and to our mortal bodies v. 11 . Therefore, Christ is now life in the Holy Spirit v. 2 , life in our spirit v. 10 , life in our mind v. 6 , and life in our mortal body v. 11 . Christ is life with fourfold riches.
[158]  But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him v. 9 . Many verses in the epistles begin with the wonderful word but.
[159]  Though Christ is in us, our body still remains dead because of sin.
[160]  Although Christ is in us, our body is still dead because of sin.
[161]  However, we should not be troubled by our dead body since our regenerated spirit is life because of righteousness.
[162]  He was not yet clothed with the proper garment, the best robe, which typifies Christ, the righteousness of God, as the covering that qualifies us to sit with the Father and to enjoy Christ as life.
[163]  Paul continues, For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live 8:13 .
[164]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN SANCTIFICATION IN LIFE
[165]  Before we come to the section on glorification, I have a burden to give an additional message on the matter of sanctification in life.
[166]  As God deals with us, He always cares for three of His divine attributes His righteousness, holiness, and glory.
[167]  In the first seven and a half chapters of Romans the word life is used many times.
[168]  It is by this life that Christ permeates us, saturates us, and infuses the holy nature of God into us, making us holy dispositionally.
[169]  In other books of the Bible we find mention of sanctification by the blood and are told that the blood of Christ has sanctified us Heb 13:12 .
[170]  The purpose is that God may produce many sons Rom 8:29 .
[171]  John 1:12 tells us that we have become the children of God, that we have been born as children of God.
[172]  Nevertheless, let me ask you a question: do you believe that you actually look like a son of God?
[173]  Yes, all real Christians have been born as children of God, but they need to grow into sanctification that they may look like the sons of God.
[174]  In this message we come to the matter of glorification.
[175]  The goal of glorification is the full sonship of the children of God.
[176]  Condemnation requires justification, justification is for sanctification, sanctification is for glorification, and glorification is for the full sonship of the children of God.
[177]  For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.
[178]  Galatians 4:6, a sister verse to Romans 8:15, says, And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
[179]  Many Christians have a mistaken, natural concept regarding the leading of the Spirit.
[180]  People invariably think that the leading of the Spirit comes suddenly from the third heaven or elsewhere.
[181]  Some ask the Lord for a sign saying, O Lord, give me a sign, an indicator, whether or not I should buy this thing.
[182]  Lord, if there s transportation available, it will be a sign that You want me to buy it, but if there s no transportation, it means that You don t want me to buy it.
[183]  As we obey the inward sense of life, we spontaneously display a mark which tells people that we are different from the devil s children, that we have the life of God within us which makes us sons of God.
[184]  If we do not live and walk according to this leading of the Spirit, we may be the children of God concerning which the Spirit witnesses with our spirit in crying, Abba, Father, but we do not have the mark that designates us as the sons of God.
[185]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE NINETEEN HEIRS OF GLORY 2 D. The Firstfruit of the Spirit
[186]  Romans 8:17 says And if children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.
[187]  In verse 17 we see that we have progressed from children to heirs.
[188]  And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[189]  This groaning apparently is our groaning, but in our groaning is the groaning of the Spirit.
[190]  In this portion of Romans we are told that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God v. 16 . In verse 16 it does not say sons or heirs, for in the first stage of sonship we are simply little children who have been regenerated by the life of God.
[191]  We were born the children of God, we are growing up as the sons of God, and we are waiting for the time when we will be fully matured and legally declared to be the rightful heirs of God.
[192]  HEIRS CONFORMED FOR GLORIFICATION A. Many Brothers of the Firstborn
[193]  In the past two messages we considered the blessings of sonship.
[194]  In this message we shall see that the heirs are conformed for glorification.
[195]  As God s firstborn Son, Christ is the model, example, pattern, and prototype for all His brothers, the many sons of God, who will be conformed to His image.
[196]  From here on we need to read more verses from Romans 8 and comment on them, including some of the verses which we have covered in the two previous messages.
[197]  Even if we do understand we still say, How am I going to handle this?
[198]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE HEIRS OF GLORY 4 2.
[199]  We cannot avoid the process mentioned in the previous message, for it is the purpose of the Holy Spirit s intercession with groanings.
[200]  God the Father knows the purpose of the Spirit s groaning and thus He causes all things to work together v. 28 . Following verses 26 and 27 which speak of the Spirit s intercession, we have verse 28 which says, And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose.
[201]  For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God.
[202]  The creation is eagerly expecting and anxiously watching to see this revelation of the sons of God, because the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him Who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God vv.
[203]  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[204]  As it is written, For Your sake we are being put to death all day long, we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter vv.
[205]  For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord vv.
[206]  We may consider chapters nine through eleven as a parenthesis and chapter twelve as a continuation of chapter eight.
[207]  In the sense of the life process or life practice it is correct to say this; however, I do not think that in Paul s concept these chapters were parenthetical, for in them are some elements which are a continuation between chapters one through eight and twelve through sixteen.
[208]  For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion v. 15 . When God says, I will, we should not argue with Him.
[209]  Paul continues, You will say to me then, Why does He still find fault?
[210]  But, O man, who are you that replies against God?
[211]  God created us in such a way that we are able to take Him into us and contain Him as our life and life supply, to the end that we be one with Him to express what He is and that He be glorified in us and with us.
[212]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE GOD S SELECTION, OUR DESTINY 2 V. THROUGH CHRIST A. Christ, the End of the Law
[213]  Romans 10:4 says, For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes.
[214]  The result of Christ s terminating the law is that God s righteousness is given to everyone who believes in Christ.
[215]  That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation.
[216]  If we want to be justified, that is, to have the righteousness of God, we must believe in the Lord Jesus.
[217]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR GOD S ECONOMY IN HIS SELECTION
[218]  God s economy in His selection is firstly with the remnant reserved by grace and secondly with the nations, the Gentiles saved through Israel s stumbling.
[219]  And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
[220]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE TRANSFORMATION IN PRACTICING
[221]  In this message we come to the most practical section in the book of Romans, the section on transformation 12:1-15:13 .
[222]  Before we consider 12:1-2 I want to give a definition of transformation.
[223]  BY THE PRESENTING OF OUR BODIES A. The Begging of the Apostle
[224]  Romans 12:1 says, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.
[225]  In 12:1 Paul speaks in a begging way, revealing the importance of the matter concerning which he is about to charge us.
[226]  For centuries and ages God has had a particular desire to have a body for Christ.
[227]  BY THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND A. Do Not Be Conformed to This Age
[228]  Romans 12:2 says, And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.
[229]  In the previous message we have considered the matters of transformation for the Body life, presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice for God s satisfaction, and the renewing of our mind that we may prove the will of God, which is to have the church life.
[230]  Romans 12:3 says, For I say through the grace given to me to everyone among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.
[231]  And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly: whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith; or service, in the service; or he who teaches, in teaching; or he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.
[232]  In verse 6 Paul says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.
[233]  As we saw in a previous message, grace is simply God in Christ as our enjoyment.
[234]  The word service in verse 7 denotes the service of the deacons and the deaconesses in the local churches See Rom 16:1; 1 Tim 3:8-13; and Phil 1:1 .
[235]  Verse 11 describes the way we should be toward God: Not slothful in zeal; burning in spirit; serving the Lord as a slave.
[236]  We must also live a normal life in relation to our persecutors and enemies.
[237]  We should bless those who persecute us and not curse them v. 14 . Regardless of how bad people may be toward us, our mouth should only express blessing, not cursing.
[238]  Romans 13:1 says, Let every person be subject to the authorities over them.
[239]  For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are appointed by God.
[240]  If we are submissive to God s appointed authorities, it is an indicator that we have a certain amount of transformation, because our natural character and disposition are rebellious.
[241]  If we read these four main sections, we shall see that God has accomplished nearly all that He intended to do.
[242]  Furthermore, Paul has unveiled to us God s identification, the life process of sanctification, and glorification.
[243]  Paul also has led us into the secret chamber of God s selection where we have seen His economy.
[244]  Whomever God has received, we are compelled to receive.
[245]  We believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He was incarnated as a man and lived on this earth, that He died upon the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected physically, and spiritually, that He has ascended to the heavens and is the Lord of all at the right hand of God, and that He dwells within us.
[246]  In 14:1 Paul says, Now him who is weak in faith receive.
[247]  Some believers are weak in faith because they have not yet received much of the transfusing and infusing of the element of God into them.
[248]  Furthermore, we must also receive the saints in the light of the judgment seat.
[249]  Here is Paul s thought: we should not argue with others or criticize them, but take care of ourselves, because one day we shall stand before the judgment seat of God to give an account of our life and work after we were saved.
[250]  In this message we need to consider some more points concerning the matter of transformation in receiving the believers.
[251]  The church is a matter of grace and life, whereas the kingdom is a matter of exercise in this age and discipline in the coming age Matt 25:15-30; 1 Cor 3:13-15 .
[252]  If you look at the back of my head, you do not see any holes; however, if you look at the front, you will see seven of them.
[253]  From one angle we see the church as a matter of grace and life; from another angle we see it as the kingdom of God with exercise and discipline.
[254]  In verse 18 Paul says, For he who in this serves Christ as a slave is well-pleasing to God and approved by men.
[255]  By this word we can see that what is mentioned in verse 17 is for us to serve Christ.
[256]  We have to do this as in the kingdom of God and in the way of serving Christ as a slave, in the way of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, not in the way of taking care of doctrinal concepts.
[257]  Let each of us please his neighbor unto what is good for building.
[258]  For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me vv.
[259]  In receiving the weaker believers, we have to realize that our God is the God of endurance and encouragement who can cause us to endure others weaknesses and to be encouraged with what He can do in others by His grace.
[260]  Verse 7 says, Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
[261]  This verse, when taken along with 14:3, proves that Christ s receiving is God s receiving.
[262]  Our receiving of the believers must be according to God s and Christ s receiving, not according to anything else.
[263]  Whomever God and Christ have received we have to receive, regardless of how much they differ from us in doctrinal concepts or religious practices.
[264]  For I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers, and for the nations to glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, Therefore I will confess to You among the nations and I will sing praise to Your name.
[265]  Therefore, Paul concluded this portion of Romans with the words, Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit v. 13 . In receiving the believers in the way as instructed in this section of Romans, we experience the God of endurance and encouragement and the God of hope.
[266]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY THE CONSUMMATION OF THE GOSPEL
[267]  In all of the foregoing messages we have covered seven sections of the book of Romans: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, and transformation.
[268]  Now we come to the last section, the conclusion 15:14-16:27 .
[269]  Although Paul has covered so much, in this section of Romans he shows us some experiential and practical matters.
[270]  I. THE OFFERING OF THE NATIONS A. Through the Ministering of Christ
[271]  That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.
[272]  Paul was a minister of Christ, a public servant serving people with Christ, ministering Christ into the Gentile believers.
[273]  We have seen Paul s relationship with two parties: with the Gentiles, to whom he ministered Christ, and with the Jews, to whom he brought material possessions.
[274]  However, 15:29 unfolds Paul s relationship with a third party: the believers in Rome whom he hoped to see on his way to Spain.
[275]  After the greeting which shows the fellowship of concern among the saints and between the churches, the Apostle declared that the God of peace would crush Satan, and would crush him soon under the feet of the saints who are in the church life 16:20 .
[276]  If we are not in the church and do not practice the church life, it will be difficult for us to have Satan crushed under our feet by God.
[277]  The church life is the strongest means by which God overcomes Satan.
[278]  But, praise the Lord, that when we are in the church and are one with the Body, Satan is under our feet, and we enjoy God as the God of peace in the church life.
[279]  When he is crushed under our feet in the church life, we have the peace of God as a token of our victory over him.
[280]  Now to Him Who is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times of the ages, but now has been manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations unto obedience of faith, to the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever!
[281]  This mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages, and has not been revealed, is mainly of two aspects: one is the mystery of God Col 2:2 ASV , which is Christ, who is in the believers Col 1:26-27 as their life and their everything that they may become the members of His Body; another is the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4-6 , which is the church as His Body to express His fullness Eph 1:22-23 .
[282]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE A CLOSING WORD I. THE GOD IN ROMANS
[283]  We have seen that God is revealed progressively throughout the book of Romans.
[284]  First of all, Romans shows us God in His creation 1:19-20 .
[285]  God is invisible; yet the invisible things of God, such as His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen, being apprehended by means of the things created by Him.
[286]  Hence, the redemption of Christ not only affords God the righteous ground upon which to justify those who believe in Christ s redemption, but also God Himself is bound by His righteousness to do so.
[287]  In Romans 1 we find the word creation ; in Romans 16 we find the word churches.
[288]  It is quite easy to say how God created: He spoke the word and creation came into being.
[289]  Now we must consider the view from our side.
[290]  In chapter one we saw that we were sinners and that neither culture nor religion could help us.
[291]  Regardless of the kind of people we were, we were all under God s condemnation.
[292]  In the book of Romans we see several stations.
[293]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO THE BASIC CONCEPT OF ROMANS
[294]  We have covered the book of Romans in a general way in the thirty-one foregoing messages.
[295]  But there are still a number of crucial points concerning the matter of life that need to be covered in detail.
[296]  Beginning with this message, we shall consider these points one by one, not taking care of the sequence of the chapters of the book of Romans, but of the important aspects of life.
[297]  The last section of Romans, chapters twelve through sixteen, covers the Body, the church life.
[298]  The many brothers in chapter eight become the members of the Body in chapter twelve.
[299]  This is not a matter of life life is fully covered in the first section but a matter of function.
[300]  The Body of Christ is the expression of Christ, and Christ is the expression of God.
[301]  How can God make sons out of such sinners?
[302]  He can do it only by three things by His righteousness, holiness, and glory.
[303]  In Romans Paul tells us that God has put His righteousness upon us and that He has reckoned His righteousness to be ours 4:22-24 .
[304]  Because we are clothed with God s righteousness, we can say, I am righteous because I am in God s righteousness.
[305]  God s righteousness has been reckoned to us through the redeeming death of Christ, and now God s holiness is being wrought into us through Christ s living in us.
[306]  Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will eventually become a glorified son of God bearing the righteousness of God outwardly, being saturated with the holiness of God inwardly, and shining in the realm of His full glory as one of His sons.
[307]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE BASIC POINTS IN CHAPTERS
[308]  In this message we shall consider some of the basic points in Romans 5 through 8.
[309]  After we realize that we have died with Christ, we must also see that we no longer have anything to do with the law.
[310]  Because we are dead, we are freed, discharged, from the law 7:6 .
[311]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR BEING FREED FROM SIN,
[312]  In the previous message we saw that the central thought of the book of Romans is that God is transforming sinners into sons to form the Body of Christ.
[313]  If we do not have this view, we shall have a very superficial understanding of Romans.
[314]  In order to accomplish the task of making sons out of sinners to form the Body of Christ, God firstly had to take care of our past deeds.
[315]  Do you still remember the things you did before you were saved?
[316]  His death has gained the righteousness of God for us, His living is working the holiness of God into our being, and His coming back will bring us into the divine glory so that we may have the full sonship.
[317]  Romans 5:19 says, Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners.
[318]  You may think that because you are saved, you are no longer a sinner.
[319]  At the time of the fall, sin came into man.
[320]  However, man did not realize how sinful he was.
[321]  This made it necessary for God to give man the law that man s sinfulness might be exposed.
[322]  God s intention in giving man the law was to expose him and to convince him of his sinfulness.
[323]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE BEING FREED FROM DEATH 1
[324]  As we have seen, the focal point of the revelation in this book is that God is transforming sinners into sons to form the Body of Christ.
[325]  God is expressed in the Son, the Son is expressed in the Body, and the Body is expressed in the local churches.
[326]  Before we became sons, we were constituted sinners 5:19 , not only in name and in position, but in constitution.
[327]  But now we must face another problem, the problem of how we can be freed from death.
[328]  If we would know this, we need to understand what death is.
[329]  THE BODY OF SIN AND THE BODY OF DEATH
[330]  The body of sin is very active and energetic in doing sinful things.
[331]  In doing the things of God we often feel tired, sleepy, and in need of rest.
[332]  In this message we need to consider several verses in chapters five through eight of Romans that cover the matter of death.
[333]  Romans 5:12 says, Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.
[334]  Romans 6:23 says, For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[335]  From 7:24 we go on to the matter of the law of sin and of death in 8:2.
[336]  Although it is difficult to find terminology to express what this law is, it is easy to understand it according to experience.
[337]  In Romans 8:10 Paul says, And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.
[338]  Because Christ, who is life, is in our spirit, our spirit is life.
[339]  However, because Christ is confined in our spirit, our body remains dead.
[340]  The death described in Romans 5 through 8 is not mainly the death that causes people to die physically, but the death that kills them today.
[341]  Death is not only God s last enemy; it is our last enemy too.
[342]  The last enemy is not sin, the law, or the flesh; it is death.
[343]  In the eyes of God nothing is as abominable as death.
[344]  Sin is against what God does, but death insults what God is.
[345]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN LAW IN ROMANS SEVEN AND EIGHT
[346]  Three crucial words in Romans 7 and 8 are law, life, and death.
[347]  It is difficult even for scientists to define life and death.
[348]  In chapter seven, however, there is still another law: I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me v. 21 . Before we can know the law covered in this verse, we need to understand the law of God, the law of the mind, the law of sin and death which is the law of sin in our members , and the law of the Spirit of life.
[349]  Now we need to consider the law of good in our mind, the law of sin in our members, and the law of life in our spirit.
[350]  In the garden of Eden there were two trees the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life.
[351]  In these two trees we see good, evil, and life.
[352]  We are a miniature garden of Eden because the triangular situation involving God, man, and Satan is now within us.
[353]  A law denotes a natural power with a certain tendency and activity.
[354]  As long as we have life, the law of this life causes us to breathe.
[355]  What we do in our daily living depends upon the law we are living by.
[356]  To do good is a law, to do evil is another law, and to live by life is still another law.
[357]  Do not think that you can do anything without a law.
[358]  In Romans 5 through 8, which we may call the kernel of the Bible, two key words are used repeatedly.
[359]  In Genesis 2 life is represented by the tree of life, and death, by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil v. 9 . The issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is actually death, not knowledge.
[360]  Romans 6:4 says, Even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[361]  Instead of remaining under the reign of death, we should walk in newness of life and stay on the line of life.
[362]  As we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, that is, in the baptism mentioned in verse 4, so we shall also grow together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, in the newness of life as mentioned in verse 4.
[363]  Then verse 11 tells us to reckon ourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[364]  LIFE IN OUR SPIRIT AND DEATH IN OUR FLESH
[365]  It is easy to move from death to life or from life to death.
[366]  In other words it is difficult not to move from one realm to another.
[367]  For example, we can just as easily switch on an electric light as we can switch it off.
[368]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE ABIDING IN CHRIST
[369]  Romans 8 is the kernel not only of the book of Romans but also of the whole Bible.
[370]  For this reason, the experience in this portion of the Word must become our daily life.
[371]  In this chapter the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of life and the Spirit of Christ, terms not used in the Old Testament, the Gospels, nor the Acts.
[372]  Firstly, in Romans 8 we find the answer to the question concerning where Christ is today.
[373]  This chapter reveals that Christ is not only in the heavens but also in us.
[374]  Romans 8:6 points the way: For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
[375]  Because the divine Spirit is mingled with our spirit, it is difficult to say whether the spirit in this verse refers to our spirit or to the divine Spirit.
[376]  In order to be deeply impressed with the need to abide in Christ by minding the spirit, we need to see even more clearly just what dwells in our flesh and what dwells in our spirit.
[377]  The word dwells is used in 7:17, 18, and 20.
[378]  In verses 17 and 20 Paul says that sin dwells in him, and in verse 18 he says that in him, that is, in his flesh, nothing good dwells.
[379]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY SAVED IN LIFE FROM SIN AND WORLDLINESS
[380]  With this message we begin a series of messages on the saving life of Christ.
[381]  Christians have devoted a great deal of attention to the death of Christ, but not much attention to Christ s life.
[382]  We may know the term the life of Christ, and we may be familiar with the verses in the Gospel of John where the Lord says that He is life and that He has come that we might have life more abundantly John 11:25; 10:10 .
[383]  In 5:10 Paul says that while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.
[384]  The death of Christ is for redemption, justification, and reconciliation.
[385]  As Paul goes on to say in this verse, Much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.
[386]  We have enjoyed the benefits of Christ s death; now we need to enjoy His life.
[387]  Just as we participate in the death of Christ, so we also need to experience the life of Christ.
[388]  It is not the life of Christ, however, that saves us from hell or from God s judgment, because we have already been saved from these things through the death of Christ on the cross for our sins.
[389]  The law of the bird life is to fly, the law of the dog life is to bark, the law of the cat life is to catch mice, the law of the chicken life is to lay eggs, and the law of the apple tree life is to produce apples.
[390]  As believers in Christ, we have the eternal life, the divine life, the life which is actually God Himself.
[391]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE SAVED IN LIFE FROM NATURALNESS
[392]  The book of Romans may be summarized in three words: redemption, life, and building.
[393]  The first chapters cover redemption, the middle portion covers life, and the last part deals with the building, which is the issue of redemption and life.
[394]  In the foregoing message we saw that after being saved, justified, and reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ s life 5:10 .
[395]  God s purpose is not merely to save us from hell or from His judgment; His purpose in the universe is to build up the Body as the corporate expression of His Son.
[396]  This organic transformation has very much to do with the building up of the Body.
[397]  Although we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, we still are very natural.
[398]  However, if we remain in our natural status, we cannot be the Body of Christ.
[399]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO SAVED IN LIFE FROM INDIVIDUALISM
[400]  Romans 5:10 is a key verse, for it concludes one section and opens another.
[401]  This verse covers both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ.
[402]  Christ died on the cross for our redemption; through redemption we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him.
[403]  Do you realize that we ourselves are the greatest hindrance to the building?
[404]  This is the reason Paul does not speak of the Body until chapter twelve, after he has covered redemption, justification, sanctification, and transformation.
[405]  If we want Christ s life to save us, we must allow Him to live in us.
[406]  Yes, we have Christ as life within us, but our mind, emotion, and will are very strong.
[407]  Most of the time, we do not give Christ the liberty to live in us.
[408]  This is why we need to lay ourselves on the altar, pray that the Lord will keep us open to Him, and allow Him to deal with the various parts of our being.
[409]  The problems in married life and in the church life are caused by this I. We may know the doctrine that the I has been crucified with Christ and may proclaim this boldly, but we may still remain strong in our mind, emotion, and will.
[410]  Romans 5:10 speaks of both the death of Christ and the life of Christ.
[411]  Although we have already been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God through the death of Christ, we still need to be saved in His life from many negative things.
[412]  In the Old Testament God commanded His people to eat only that which was regarded as clean.
[413]  They were not to eat anything that was unclean.
[414]  However, most of God s people did not realize that these dietary regulations were related to Christ.
[415]  What a mercy it is to be in the church life!
[416]  Many say that it is impossible to have the oneness today and that it is idealistic to try to have the church life in genuine oneness.
[417]  Apart from the Lord s mercy, we cannot be one with others.
[418]  If the Lord had not been merciful to us in China, we brothers could not have been brought into oneness and kept in oneness.
[419]  According to God s economy, as human beings we must believe in the Lord Jesus and be Christians.
[420]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR SAVED IN LIFE FROM SELF-LIKENESS 1
[421]  The key verse in the book of Romans is 5:10; For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.
[422]  Reconciliation to God through Christ has been accomplished already, but salvation in His life from so many negative things is still a daily matter.
[423]  The death of Christ on the cross has already dealt with all negative things.
[424]  This is the reason we refer to Christ s death as the all-inclusive death.
[425]  Since Christ s death has already dealt with the negative things, why do we still need to be saved in His life?
[426]  We have pointed out in some of the foregoing messages that the central concept of the book of Romans is not justification by faith, but that God is making sons out of sinners in order to form the Body to express Christ.
[427]  How I worship God that He is working all things together!
[428]  Because of His working, eventually we all shall be conformed to the image of the Son of God.
[429]  Everyone in the New Jerusalem will be in the image of the Son of God.
[430]  Romans 1:4 says that Jesus Christ was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[431]  Christ s divinity and glory as the Son of God were concealed in His flesh.
[432]  No one had vision that could penetrate through His flesh to see that He was the glorious Son of God.
[433]  But after He had passed through the process of death and resurrection, He was designated the Son of God, that is, He was marked out and manifested to be the Son of God.
[434]  As the flesh in verse 3 refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the Person of the Holy Spirit of God, but to the divine essence of Christ, which is the fulness of the Godhead Col 2:9 .
[435]  Before His death and resurrection the holiness of God was in Christ s spirit, but this holy essence had not been manifested in His flesh.
[436]  The concept of outward change is ethical and religious.
[437]  The divine concept is not to correct us outwardly; it is to transform us inwardly and organically with Christ Himself as the holy essence.
[438]  In the same principle, we are all undergoing the process of God s sanctification, whether we are conscious of it or not.
[439]  In the foregoing messages we have covered a number of negative things from which we need to be saved in the life of Christ: the law of sin, worldliness, naturalness, individualism, divisiveness, and self-likeness.
[440]  Now we proceed to the matter of reigning in life.
[441]  Romans 5:17 says, For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
[442]  Going along with verse 17, verse 21 says, That as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[443]  As kings reigning in life, we must subdue the enemies and rule over them.
[444]  Do not regard your wife or husband as an enemy over whom you must rule.
[445]  According to both the Gospel of John and the book of Romans, our major enemies are sin, death, and Satan.
[446]  MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE MEANING OF REIGNING IN LIFE
[447]  God s intention in His creation of man was that man would express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion or authority.
[448]  This means that God intends that man enjoy Him as life and reign in this life.
[449]  Genesis 1:28 says that God commissioned man to subdue the earth, to conquer it.
[450]  Romans 8:2 says, For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
[451]  In this verse we have law, sin, and death in contrast to law, Spirit, and life.
[452]  Life is opposed to death, and the Spirit is opposed to sin.
[453]  Sin is Satan embodied in us, and the Spirit is God living in us.
[454]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT REIGNING IN LIFE OVER DEATH
[455]  In this message we shall consider the matter of reigning in life over death.
[456]  Before we do this, however, let us review the difference between sin and evil and that between grace and the Spirit.
[457]  Romans 8:2, putting the Spirit and life together, speaks of the Spirit of life.
[458]  In the same principle, we may speak of the evil of death.
[459]  But when this very God comes to live in us in a practical way, He is the Spirit.
[460]  In our experience, we may find that the law of the Spirit of life does not always work as effectively as Paul indicates in this verse.
[461]  The reason for this is that we want the law of life to overcome certain things such as our temper, but we may not give the law of life opportunity to do whatever it chooses in us.
[462]  In order to experience life as the Spirit living in us, we need to come to the source of life, God, the Lord, under the cleansing of the redeeming blood of Christ with an open heart and spirit.
[463]  To reign in life is to subdue three main enemies: Satan, sin, and death.
[464]  First John 5:4 says, For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.
[465]  This verse does not say whosoever, referring to a person; it says whatsoever, referring to a thing.
[466]  In contrast to 1 John 3:9, which speaks of whosoever, or every one who is born of God, 1 John 5:4 speaks of whatsoever, or every thing that is born of God.
[467]  If we understand 1 John 5:4 in the light of John 3:6, we shall realize that what is born of God is the human spirit.
[468]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT
[469]  In the foregoing messages we have seen that we need to reign in life over sin, death, and Satan, our three main enemies.
[470]  In chapters five through eight sin and death are covered in a full way.
[471]  In 16:20 Paul speaks of Satan; he says that the God of peace will soon crush Satan under our feet.
[472]  We need to emphasize that there is nothing good in the flesh in order to help seeking Christians who often become disappointed with their spiritual progress.
[473]  The more they desire to be holy, the less holy they seem to become.
[474]  They long to be one with the Lord, but end up doing many things that are not of the Lord.
[475]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE SERVING IN THE GOSPEL OF HIS SON
[476]  In Romans 1:9 Paul says, For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.
[477]  Many Christians think that the gospel is simply the good news of how Christ is the Savior who died that sinners may be forgiven and one day go to heaven.
[478]  In the very first verse of Romans Paul says that as a slave of Christ and a called apostle, he was separated to the gospel of God.
[479]  The main concern of the gospel is not forgiveness nor the winning of souls nor the saving of sinners for heaven; it is the very Person of Christ, the Son of God.
[480]  In 1:16 Paul says that the gospel is the power of God.
[481]  The reason the gospel is so powerful is that the righteousness of God is revealed in it.
[482]  Many expositions of Romans do not give an adequate definition of the righteousness of God.
[483]  It is correct to say that the righteousness of God is simply Christ.
[484]  But in Romans Paul does not say that the power of the gospel is the Holy Spirit or the love of God or the grace of God.
[485]  One day I saw that I was saved not only by the love of God and by the grace of God, but by the righteousness of God.
[486]  In our reading of Romans we may pay attention to condemnation, justification, sanctification, and glorification, but neglect the matters of sonship, transformation, conformation, and the Body life.
[487]  The central thought of Romans is not condemnation nor justification; it is not even sanctification nor glorification.
[488]  Many of us were taught that we were sinners, that God loved us, and that God sent His Son to die on the cross for our redemption.
[489]  God does not intend that we lose our humanity.
[490]  On the contrary, we shall bear our humanity for eternity.
[491]  He enjoys it when we declare the fact that God no longer has just one Son, the only begotten Son, but many sons, Christ as the Firstborn and us as the many sons of God.
[492]  In this process of resurrection there are four aspects: sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.
[493]  In 6:22 Paul says, But now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.
[494]  Sanctification, the process of being made holy, brings us into the enjoyment of eternal life.
[495]  In 12:2 Paul speaks of transformation, saying that we should not be conformed to this age, but that we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind.
[496]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE SONSHIP IN ROMANS
[497]  In order to do this, however, we need to know what the gospel is.
[498]  Verse 4 says that this designation was according to the Spirit of holiness.
[499]  The illustration of a carnation seed will help us understand the meaning of this.
[500]  As the Son of God with both divinity and humanity, Christ is now the pattern and model for the mass production of the many sons of God.
[501]  On the one hand, to be resurrected means to put everything negative to death; on the other hand, it means to release all the positive things, to uplift what has been put to death and resurrected.
[502]  Strictly speaking, in God s economy there is no outward correction, adjustment, or improvement.
[503]  We have seen that in 1:1 Paul said that he was separated to the gospel of God, and then he goes on to say that the gospel of God concerns God s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord 1:3 .
[504]  The goal of this gospel is to transform sinners into sons of God for the formation of the Body of Christ.
[505]  But on the day of our glorification, no one will need to ask us whether or not we are Christians, for we shall be manifested as sons of God.
[506]  Apart from God Himself, the most powerful thing in the universe is death.
[507]  As believers, we have Christ within us as resurrection, and this resurrection is our life-power.
[508]  Day by day this power functions to conquer death.
[509]  The universe is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God 8:19 .
[510]  This manifestation will not come as an accident, but it will come as the consummation of the process of designation, just as a carnation flower blossoms as the consummation of a long process of growth and change.
[511]  The more we grow, the more we are designated by resurrection.
[512]  One day, at the time of our glorification, we shall fully blossom and manifestly be the sons of God.
[513]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE DESIGNATION BY THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS
[514]  In the foregoing message we considered seven significant words: designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation.
[515]  God designates us and causes us to undergo the process of resurrection by means of His Spirit and with life.
[516]  Also, God sanctifies us, transforms us, conforms us, glorifies us, and brings us into the full manifestation of sonship by the Spirit with life.
[517]  The New Testament clearly reveals that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[518]  This understanding may differ from traditional theology, but it corresponds to the pure Word of God.
[519]  The New Testament reveals that Christ, God incarnated as a man, died on the cross for our sins, was resurrected from among the dead, ascended to the heavens, and has been glorified and enthroned as the King, the Head, and the Lord over all.
[520]  Satan, the subtle enemy of God, may allow people to know that Christ is the Son of God who was incarnated as a man, who died on the cross for our redemption, who was resurrected, and who has ascended to the right hand of God.
[521]  The way to use this switch is given in 10:12.
[522]  There it says, The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.
[523]  This divine electricity is rich to all who switch on, and the way to switch on is to call on the name of the Lord.
[524]  If we simply think about what the Lord is to us, we do not have any practical contact with Him.
[525]  The mind set upon the spirit is not only life, but peace as well.
[526]  God is rich and all His riches are for us; but there is the need of the Spirit as the current for the application of the riches of God to our experience.
[527]  In the last message we considered ten matters related to the Spirit: holiness, life, law, peace, joy, love, hope, power, service, and preaching.
[528]  Now we shall consider another ten items to impress us with the richness of the indwelling Spirit.
[529]  In 8:26 and 27 we have the interceding of the Spirit.
[530]  Often the Spirit intercedes with sighs or groanings, especially when we are about to do something displeasing to the Lord.
[531]  The purpose of the Spirit s intercession is that we would be conformed to the image of Christ.
[532]  For this reason, verse 27 says that the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God.
[533]  When we do something that does not help to conform us to the image of Christ, the Spirit groans within us.
[534]  Because of the Spirit s groaning, the Christian life is not always a life of joy, for we are inwardly troubled when we do certain things.
[535]  Translators have a difficult time deciding whether or not to use a capital letter for the word for Spirit in chapter eight.
[536]  The reason is that the Spirit in this chapter is the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit.
[537]  Therefore, to walk according to the spirit in chapter eight is to walk according to the mingled spirit.
[538]  We have seen that the book of Romans is the gospel of sonship.
[539]  However, in this book another important matter is covered, and that is the matter of righteousness.
[540]  Now that Christ has died and has been raised from among the dead, it is impossible for God to change His mind about forgiving us.
[541]  Rather, we have the ground to say to Him, O God, whether You love me or not, You must forgive me.
[542]  Before Christ died on the cross, You could have changed Your mind.
[543]  Now that Christ has died to fulfill God s righteous requirements, God has put Himself into a position where He is legally bound.
[544]  We should not look at ourselves, but look at the ascended Christ.
[545]  Hebrews 1:3 says that after Christ made purification for sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[546]  The ascended Christ seated at the right hand of God is the receipt for the payment for our forgiveness.
[547]  Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God s righteousness.
[548]  Whenever we claim the blood of Jesus and appeal to God s righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us 1 John 1:9 .
[549]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT THE SELECTION OF GRACE
[550]  This gospel includes many wonderful items: sonship, designation, resurrection, justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation.
[551]  In this message we shall consider a further item the selection of grace.
[552]  Ephesians 1:4 and 5 prove that God s selection and predestination took place in eternity past: According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[553]  I do not wish to enter into the theological debate concerning man s responsibility in relation to God s sovereignty.
[554]  I simply desire to emphasize the fact of God s selection.
[555]  Because of God s mercy in His selection of grace, we responded to the gospel when others did not respond; we received a word about Christ as our life when others refused to receive it; and we took the way of the Lord s recovery today when others drew back from taking this way.
[556]  If we would serve the Lord, we must know the Spirit, the life in the Spirit, and the righteousness of God.
[557]  Furthermore, we must know God s mercy in the selection of grace.
[558]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY LIFE
[559]  In this message we shall consider the practice of the Body life as it is presented in the closing chapters of Romans.
[560]  In order to be members of the Body of Christ, we must be sons of God.
[561]  Chapter twelve is important concerning the doctrine of the Body life, whereas chapter fourteen is important concerning the practice of the Body life.
[562]  In chapter fourteen Paul addresses the problem of receiving believers whose opinions and practices differ from ours.
[563]  There may be differences not only among believers in a local church but also between local churches themselves.
[564]  For example, the church in one locality may practice pray-reading, but the church in another locality may not practice it.
[565]  Romans is an all-inclusive book, a summary both of the Christian life and of the church life.
[566]  When we speak of the dispensation of the Triune God, we mean that God distributes Himself to us and then dispenses Himself into our being just as the juice is dispensed from the container into those who drink it.
[567]  This verse indicates that the Son of God once died.
[568]  However, it speaks of the death of God s Son.
[569]  In order for Christ to be in us, God must be the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God must be the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ must be Christ.
[570]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE DISPENSATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[571]  It is very important that we get into the depths of the book of Romans and not read it in a superficial way.
[572]  God s righteousness, holiness, and glory form the basic structure of the book of Romans.
[573]  We have laid stress on the fact that God s righteousness requires the death both of Christ and of ourselves.
[574]  Because God s righteousness has been satisfied, God is justified in dispensing Himself into His redeemed and crucified people.
[575]  Only the death of Christ and your death with Christ fulfills the requirement of His righteousness and gives God the ground righteously to impart Himself into you.
[576]  Romans covers not only the attributes of righteousness and holiness, but also the attribute of glory.
[577]  Glorification began at the time of Christ s ascension, and it will consummate at His coming back.
[578]  The whole creation is eagerly expecting to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God v. 21 . In verse 30 Paul says that those whom God has predestinated, called, and justified, He has also glorified.
[579]  Before we consider the life of the Triune God dispensed into the tripartite man, we need to say a further word about the dispensation of the Triune God according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory.
[580]  God s dispensation, therefore, is according to His righteous way, through His holy nature, and unto the expression of Himself.
[581]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that God s righteousness is related to the death of Christ, which terminated all negative things.
[582]  This means that not only the death of Christ Himself is righteous, but also our death in Christ is righteous in God s eyes.
[583]  The glorification of the church that began at Pentecost has not yet reached its consummation.
[584]  On the contrary, the process of glorification is still taking place.
[585]  The more we are sanctified through Christ s saturating our being with His holy nature, the more we shall express God when we come together as the church.
[586]  The Spirit and Christ, the Son, are mentioned explicitly, whereas God the Father is implied by the fact that the Spirit is the Spirit of God.
[587]  In order for the divine life to be dispensed into us, this life first had to pass through a long process involving incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, and descension.
[588]  The life dispensed into us is actually the processed Triune God.
[589]  In Genesis 1:1 this life could not be dispensed into man, for as yet it had not passed through the necessary stages.
[590]  We have emphasized the fact that our spirit has become life because Christ dwells within us.
[591]  Drop the ethical and religious teachings and come back to God s living Word, which reveals that the life of the Triune God is dispensed into our spirit to make our spirit life and also reveals that the mind set on the spirit is life.
[592]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE NOT AN EXCHANGED LIFE,
[593]  God s economy is a matter of the dispensing of the divine life into our being.
[594]  As a result of this dispensation, we, the chosen people of God, have both the human life and the divine life.
[595]  We are gloves in the likeness of the divine hand.
[596]  This means that we do not have the thumb, but the form of the thumb; not the fingers, but the likeness of the fingers.
[597]  Our gentleness is only the form, whereas God s gentleness is the substance, the reality.
[598]  Because we were created according to the likeness of God, we have the capacity to be godly, that is, to be like God.
[599]  Because neither the illustration of the vessel nor that of married life picture anything organic related to God s dispensation, Paul goes on to use a third illustration the grafting of one tree to another.
[600]  In 11:17-24 Paul uses the illustration of branches from a wild olive tree being grafted into a cultivated olive tree.
[601]  In John 14:20 the Lord Jesus said, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
[602]  The day spoken of here is the day of Christ s resurrection.
[603]  In this verse the Lord was saying that on the day of His resurrection His disciples would know that He is in the Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them.
[604]  This is the mingling that comes from the dispensing, the infusing, of the life of the Triune God into us.
[605]  In this message we shall consider the function of the grafted life.
[606]  In order to see this, we need to ask the Lord to remove all the veils that keep us from receiving a true understanding of this book.
[607]  Because many readers of this book are veiled, they do not see the dispensation of the life of the Triune God, the grafted life, nor even the tripartite man in Romans 8.
[608]  From the time God created us in His image and according to His likeness, we were ready to receive Him into us as life.
[609]  We had a spirit to receive Him and a soul to express Him.
[610]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that, according to the principle ordained by God, the lower life cannot subdue the higher life, but the higher life swallows up the negative aspects of the lower life.
[611]  The divine life is like an all-inclusive dose of medicine.
[612]  Included in this dose is the killing power of the crucifixion of Christ that puts to death the negative elements of our human life.
[613]  Furthermore, Christ s resurrection power resurrects and uplifts all the proper elements in our human life, the elements which God created in His image and after His likeness.
[614]  The more we tell the Lord Jesus that we love Him, the more we offer ourselves to Him to contain Him, and the more time we spend with Him in the Word and in fellowship, the more the ingredients of the divine life work to terminate us and to resurrect us.
[615]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE TRANSFORMATION AND CONFORMATION
[616]  As believers in Christ, our relationship with the Lord is wholly a matter of life.
[617]  In this verse he says that we shall be saved in His life, and in 5:17, that we shall reign in life.
[618]  Furthermore, the mind set on the spirit is life 8:6 , and the divine life is imparted into our mortal bodies through the Spirit of Him who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead 8:11 .
[619]  Through the growth and function of the divine life within us, God will reach His goal to produce many sons to form the Body to express Christ.
[620]  They are windows through which we can see into the depths of the revelation implied in the book of Romans.
[621]  Transformation is related to the life process, and conformation is related to the life goal.
[622]  What I intend to share regarding this is the product of more than fifty years of Christian experience considered in the light of God s holy Word.
[623]  But on the other hand, baptism continues until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.
[624]  This means that we are daily under the application of the death of Christ as we experience the effectiveness of Christ s death, which is now one of the ingredients, the elements, in the all-inclusive Spirit.
[625]  If our husband or wife gives us a difficult time, we can experience at that very moment the application of Christ s death.
[626]  Every kind of life has four basic features: the life-essence, the life-power, the life-law, and the life-shape.
[627]  Although the essence of a certain life may be abstract and mysterious, the life itself is powerful in a very substantial way.
[628]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX GOD CONDEMNING SIN IN THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-11 TWO KINDS OF CONDEMNATION
[629]  In 8:1 Paul says, There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[630]  It is easy for us to take this verse for granted and assume that we understand it, perhaps thinking that the condemnation here is the same as that spoken of in chapter three.
[631]  Before we were saved, we probably did not have any realization that in the sight of God we were condemned according to His righteous law.
[632]  Paul begins chapter eight with a word concerning condemnation: There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[633]  Once again I would say that the condemnation here is inward.
[634]  Here the writer can praise and declare that there is no longer any condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[635]  When some read this verse, they may say, I am in Christ Jesus.
[636]  In the universe there are two worlds, two realms, a spiritual world and a physical one.
[637]  In this spiritual world there are demons, evil spirits, and many negative things which bother us.
[638]  According to Colossians 2:15, God the Father came in to clear the way so that Christ s crucifixion would not be frustrated.
[639]  THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-11
[640]  If we read this chapter carefully, we shall see that its subject is not actually the Spirit, but the law of the Spirit of life.
[641]  If we read chapter eight carefully and compare it with chapters five, six, and seven, we shall see that the law of the Spirit of life is the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us.
[642]  The Triune God, who has been processed and who has dispensed Himself into us as tripartite human beings, is Himself the law of the Spirit of life.
[643]  When Paul speaks of law in Romans 8, he uses this term in a scientific way, even though, when the book of Romans was written, science had not yet developed.
[644]  In order to become the law of the Spirit of life operating in us, the Triune God had to be processed and dispensed into us, and then He had to dwell, reside, in us.
[645]  This working of the Triune God as a law within us can be illustrated by the electricity which has been installed in our homes.
[646]  Since electricity has been installed in our homes, there is no need for us to call the power plant when we need electrical energy to operate a certain appliance.
[647]  The expression God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin refers to the incarnation, the first step of the process through which the Triune God has passed.
[648]  Here in verse 3 the subject is not the Son of God; the subject is God.
[649]  We must believe God s word and not consider our situation or look at ourselves.
[650]  When we read these words, we may say, Most of the time I walk according to flesh, not according to spirit.
[651]  If someone asked you if you are walking according to spirit or according to flesh, you probably would not have the boldness to say that you walk according to spirit.
[652]  Do you realize that you are in the spirit?
[653]  Romans 8:9 gives us the boldness to say that we are in spirit: But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[654]  LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE BEING IN THE SPIRIT TO EXPERIENCE
[655]  But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[656]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that to be of Christ is a matter of position, but to be in spirit is a matter of condition.
[657]  Many Christians have received teachings that distract them from the spirit.
[658]  Some have been taught in this way: Now that you are a child of God, you must behave yourself and glorify God.
[659]  Now let us go on to consider from Romans 8 the various aspects of the blessed work of the Spirit.
[660]  But we have someone much higher than the President dwelling in us we have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit!
[661]  Fourth, in verse 14 we have the function of the Spirit s leading: For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
