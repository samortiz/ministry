King David had prepared a tabernacle in Zion, but it was not according to the pattern revealed by God on the mount. It was a tent pitched according to David&#8217;s opinion. Church history is full of such incidents. So many faithful Christians do have the ark-Christ alone. Then, later, they sense the need of the church life to express Christ just as David sensed the need of a tabernacle to contain the ark. So they pitch a tabernacle, they set up a meeting according to their own understanding, according to the same principle practiced by David. Some Christians pitch a tabernacle on their &#8220;Zion,&#8221; while others pitch another tabernacle on the ground of their choosing. Is not this the situation today? There are many, many &#8220;Zions.&#8221; All say that their place is Zion, the highest and the best. Some Christians have even relinquished their family life and their jobs in order to pitch a little tent for the ark. So many have meetings in their homes. &#8220;What is wrong with this?&#8221; you may ask. &#8220;Is this not good?&#8221; Yes, David also did something good with a good heart and good intentions. But it was not according to the Lord&#8217;s revelation; so it did not bring full satisfaction. It was good, but it was inadequate; it fell short of God&#8217;s full purpose.<p>We must be exceedingly clear concerning the principles of these four conditions of history. The first is the normal condition of the church with Christ within it. The second is that of the church without Christ-a completely abnormal situation. The third condition is that of Christ without the church. That is better, but it is still abnormal. There are many people today in this third condition. They are disgusted with the empty church life; so they abandon the thought of having any kind of church life. After a certain time, however, they sense the need of meeting together and begin a certain kind of church according to their own wisdom and choice. This is not proper. This is the fourth condition-Christ in an improper &#8220;church.&#8221; This situation is only half right. Such Christians know deeply within themselves that they do not have full satisfaction. Yes, they are doing good, helping people, and trying to meet together to glorify the Lord, but they do not have full satisfaction in their way of practice. They still have a deep sense that they need something more proper. They have a certain kind of church life, but not the proper church life, the proper tabernacle. Although they do not know the proper way, they sense that what they have is not so proper. They lack the full assurance that what they are practicing is completely right. There is no need of argument or debate concerning this matter: if we feel peaceful concerning the way of our church practice, let us continue; but most people in this poor condition do not have full peace or satisfaction, because in fact they have fallen short of the full purpose of God concerning the church life.<h2 class=head2>(5) Christ with a Proper Church</h2><p>The fifth condition is that of the ark with the proper tabernacle, enlarged and increased. It is in this situation, of Christ with a proper church to express Himself, that you feel completely at home. Praise the Lord, I have been at home for more than thirty years now! People may try to criticize or argue, but I know that most of them have some degree of emptiness within them. I can say with full assurance that I am at home; I know that I am in the church containing Christ, and I know that I have Christ with a proper church life. We will see more concerning the proper church life in the following chapters.<p>We must all be clear concerning these five positions in history. The first is completely right, while the second is completely empty; the third position is good, but abnormal, and the fourth position is one of half-satisfaction; the fifth position is that of Christ as the reality with a proper church as the expression. We will never be fully satisfied until we come to the fifth position. I believe that in these last days the Lord is not only going to recover the original, normal condition, but He is also going to enlarge the church life and make it more solid. There are many attacks from the enemy, but the Lord is faithful; the faithfulness of the Lord will see to it-He cannot deny Himself. He is victorious. He can never be defeated! Eventually He will accomplish whatever is necessary to fulfill His purpose in a more solid and full way. Let us praise Him!<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
