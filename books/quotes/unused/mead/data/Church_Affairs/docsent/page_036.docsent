   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man s Memory Not Reliable</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why do we need a record book?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need it because man s memory is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>People depend on their memory to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a person s memory is not reliable, he will not be able to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he sometimes remembers and sometimes forgets, what shall he do in order to carry out anything?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, I recognize that some brothers and sisters among us have very good memories.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if one day your memory were faulty, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is recorded in the record book is likely to be more accurate than what is in your memory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not Easy to Find People</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, even if one s memory is good, it may be difficult to find him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The one who is taking care of this matter may remember everything, but if he has gone away, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there were a record book, we could open it and read and understand the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Timothy was in the church in Ephesus, he had to take care of the churches in the surrounding area, establishing elders to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Timothy went to Rome and Titus went to Jerusalem, what would have been done concerning the problems of the widows if there had been no record books?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Maybe they would have had to send a person to Rome to ask Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If Timothy had said, I have forgotten what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not know whether I moved one from Pergamos to here or one from Thyatira to there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then what would have been done?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If record books were there, no one would need to remember, and anyone could open them up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we need to see that church records and the keeping of records in the church are important.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You cannot say that you or I will remember.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The whole point is to write it down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It does not matter who it is; once time passes, even the one with the best memory can forget.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the world there are not that many people who can still remember things accurately after many years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if you can remember, if suddenly you cannot be found, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the principle of having the record book comes in. The New Testament does not show us how to write things down in this record book or what kind of records we should keep, but the Lord has shown us that keeping records should be our principle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, many church matters need to be recorded in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, we hope that any church with a considerable number of people would have a business office.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not want to use this name, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can call it whatever name you choose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Shanghai it is called the service office because deacons are the ones taking care of affairs there all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We want to keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not want to be like many Protestants who pay attention to these titles; we only want to do things according to the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church it is acceptable to call it the service office or the business office.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The business office is a secular term; the service office is a name given by us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THINGS HANDLED IN THE SERVICE OFFICE For Contacting One Another</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this office the main work is to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One is to meet the need of the brothers and sisters who wish to discuss matters face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a local church there is not much problem if there are not many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a church is in a large city or the number of brothers and sisters is more than several hundred, it is not easy to find someone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone comes from out of town, he would not know whom to look for.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the deacons in the church should come to the business office to work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There must be a place, and there must be someone available so that when people come, you have a way to make arrangements to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should distribute to each, as anyone has need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should have a place to keep records, knowing what the needs are, how many people there are, how many family units there are, and how many children there are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There should always be someone supervising and arranging.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words there must be a place for making arrangements and for contacting one another in order to take care of matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the first use of the service office: mutual contact of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, if some brother or sister comes to that church to look for other brothers and sisters, he would not know where to go to look for them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There must be a place where he can find them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not know if you have seen this principle or not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such contact with one another requires a business office, or we might call it the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For Keeping Many Records</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The second use of the service office is for keeping many records.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are a considerable number of affairs in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every week there are quite a few letters of recommendation written and sent out, quite a few announcements to be made, quite a few things to pray for, quite a few people to be received, and quite a few people baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All these things need to be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There may be brothers and sisters who have moved; there may be some who are sick and some who have family problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It will not work to have one or two persons trying to remember all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even if you could remember all this, when anyone needed to check the information, he would have to look for you, but even so, he could not look into your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>People need something that they can open up and look into.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not mean that these things need to be kept forever.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that when the spiritual aspects are gone, these things will be gone too.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When there are blessings, these things and these methods are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the blessing is gone, there will be no need for these methods to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, as long as there is blessing, before God we need to seek a way for an arrangement to be made to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a need for a place, for someone to serve, and for the records to be available.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This place is our business office.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Both the place and the personnel must be available; then it will be possible for all the affairs to be handled.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Someone needs to be there to receive people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The records need to be readily available.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There should be no need to ask a certain brother for information, for man s memory is not reliable, and man s life is not reliable either.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Having records available is more stable and more reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I want the brothers and sisters to understand why we need to have the service office.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For what purpose have we had a service office in Shanghai since 1938?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The service office meets the local needs and is able to take good care of the affairs of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not intend to take good care of the affairs of the saints, then you do not need an office.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you remember, you remember; if you do not remember, you just let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>That is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If, however, you want everything to be well taken care of, you must have the service office.</S>
