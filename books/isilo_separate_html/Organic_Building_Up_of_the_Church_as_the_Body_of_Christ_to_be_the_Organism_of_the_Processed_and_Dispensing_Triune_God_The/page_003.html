<p>When we speak of the essence of anything, we are referring to its most intrinsic part. Regarding the church, the most important positive factor is its intrinsic essence. Many in Christianity have made the church something outward. When some speak of the church, they mean a physical building. If they speak of going to church, they mean going to a chapel or cathedral or some kind of sanctuary. These are material things constructed of bricks, stones, steel, or wood. What a mistake this is! While others are somewhat improved in their concept, they still pay too much attention to the outward aspects of the church, such as its organization. Many Christians are experiencing conflicts with each other today because they are in the realm of the outward factors rather than centering on the intrinsic essence of the church. Instead of being one with one another to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy, many Christians are divided and even fighting one another. This is similar to the fighting among the nations of the world. The United Nations was formed with the intention to unite the nations, but throughout the years, there have only been division and fighting among them.</p>
<p>We need to see that the church is one. It is the only church of the unique God. This church is the unique Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of this Body. In John 17 the Lord prayed that we all might be one (John 17:11, 21-23), but if we look at Christian history throughout the past nineteen centuries, we will find that the Christians have been fighting one another. The strange thing is that if we Christians had never come together, we would have no fighting. If there had been no marriage, there would be no divorce. Every divorce had its beginning with a dear, sweet, precious marriage.</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for sixty-four years. From the time that I began to meet with other Christians, I have witnessed much fighting. The closer we are to one another, the more of a tendency we have to fight with one another. Those who love each other can become enemies. Hatred can replace love, and jealousy can replace sympathy. This is today&rsquo;s situation in Christianity. What a shame this is! Why has so much fighting taken place on this earth among Christians for so many centuries? It is because the Christians have turned from the intrinsic essence of the church to something outward.</p>
<p>There are four intrinsic matters of the church. The first of these is the essence of the church. Then the growth of the church is also intrinsic. If a tree grows, it grows in its intrinsic part. Following the growth is the building up of the church. The fourth intrinsic element of the church is its fellowship. The essence, the growth, the building up, and the fellowship are all very intrinsic. If every Christian remained in these four intrinsic matters, we would have no problems. Whenever we turn from the intrinsic matters to something that we can touch outwardly and that we can see outwardly, we are on the way to &ldquo;divorce.&rdquo; This is because all the outward, physical things are dividing factors.</p>
<p>If we learn this lesson and receive the grace of the Lord, we will say, &ldquo;Lord, save me! Rescue me and turn me from the outward to the intrinsic.&rdquo; Then immediately we will be one. This is why I am so burdened to fellowship about these four crucial things: the intrinsic essence, the intrinsic growth, the intrinsic building up, and the intrinsic fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Life, Which Generates the Church</h2>
<p>The divine life, God&rsquo;s life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, the indestructible life, is the very essence of the church, and this divine life generates the church (1 John 1:2; 5:1). Of course, we cannot see this divine life, just as we are not able to see the steel in this meeting hall. This is because the steel is covered by stones and wood, yet the steel is the very essence of this building&rsquo;s structure.</p>
<p>The essence of the church is the divine life, and the divine life is Christ as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God (John 14:6; Col. 2:9). God was just God in eternity past, but one day the entire God, the complete God in the second person of His divine Trinity, became incarnated. Incarnation is a wonderful process whereby God entered into man. The Triune God entered into a human virgin&rsquo;s womb and stayed there for nine months. It was by this wonderful process that He put man upon Himself and that He Himself became a man. God with His divine Trinity was embodied in a man. That man, by the name of Jesus of Nazareth, was a real, perfect, and genuine man, yet His very intrinsic essence was God. He is both God and man, the God-man. This wonderful man lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He lived in a carpenter&rsquo;s home, and He Himself was a carpenter (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3). How wonderful it is that the Triune God in this man sawed wood and did carpentry work! This was His human living for thirty years.</p>
<p>When He was thirty years of age, He came out to minister. In His ministry, He had to deal with &ldquo;troublesome&rdquo; ones like Peter and the sons of thunder, James and John (Mark 3:17). I do not know why the Lord Jesus did not choose disciples who were all wise, rich, and educated. Instead, some of those He chose were fishermen from Galilee. They were peculiar and rough like Peter. The Lord even chose Judas Iscariot, who became His betrayer. After the Lord&rsquo;s betrayal, He was arrested, but actually, He voluntarily entered into death (John 10:17-18). He bore the cross, and He went to the cross to die an all-inclusive death to solve all of our problems and all of God&rsquo;s problems. He resurrected and then ascended to another realm, the third heaven, where He still is today (Eph. 4:10; Heb. 4:14; 1:3; cf. 2 Cor. 12:2).</p>
<p>God passed through all these processes to become someone who can carry out the dispensing. This is why we say that the church is the organism of the processed and dispensing Triune God. The very God whom we worship is a processed God. He has been processed in order to be a dispensing One. Our God is now the processed Triune God to be a dispensing God. Today He does not need to pass through any other process. What He is doing today is dispensing Himself into man. We should not forget that without God being processed, there is no ground for Him to dispense Himself into us. His passing through the processes was for Him to be a dispensing God.</p>
<p>Because He is the dispensing God, He is able to regenerate us, and this regenerating life is the divine life. The term &ldquo;divine life&rdquo; is simple, but the implication of this term is not that simple. The divine life is the dispensing God, who is the very essence of the church. We all can testify that when we were first saved, we were always happy to meet another saved one. Many times we became more intimate with one another than with our fleshly brothers and sisters. We Christians love one another because we have the same essence. It does not matter whether we are American, European, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, white, black, yellow, brown, or red. As long as we are real Christians, we have a loving essence within us. When we turn away from this intrinsic essence to touch other things, we begin to fight one another. After we have been together for a while, problems may begin to arise over outward things. In order to solve the problems between Christians, we must come to the intrinsic matters of the church: first, the intrinsic essence; second, the intrinsic growth; third, the intrinsic building up; and fourth, the intrinsic fellowship. We are safeguarded in these four intrinsic matters.</p>
<p>The intrinsic essence of the church is the divine life that the processed Triune God has dispensed and is now dispensing into us. The divine life generates us by the regeneration of the Spirit in our spirit. The divine Spirit begets the human spirit (John 3:3, 5-6). How wonderful it is that these two spirits are mingled as one (1 Cor. 6:17)! John 3 does not use the term &ldquo;Holy Spirit.&rdquo; It only says &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit is mingled with our spirit as one spirit. The Spirit becomes one with man, and this regenerated man becomes one with God. Is this not wonderful? Within us is a part that is mingled with God. God is so high, yet He has become one with us. I feel honored that I am one with God and that I have God one with me. This is the significance of regeneration. I hope all the new believers could have this kind of uplifted understanding regarding regeneration. As soon as we were saved, we became mingled with God.</p>
<p>When we are regenerated, we are made the children of God as the bride of Christ, who is the Bridegroom, for His increase, as typified by Eve as the counterpart to Adam (John 1:12-13; 3:29-30; Gen. 2:21-23). Regeneration makes the believers the children of God. Because we are God&rsquo;s children, we may say that our last name is &ldquo;God.&rdquo; We all know that our last name is our family name, and we all have become God&rsquo;s family. This is why we call each other brothers and sisters. We are of one Father with one family name.</p>
<p>Individually, we are children of God, but corporately we are one entity, the bride of Christ. In the first part of John 3, the Lord Jesus speaks concerning regeneration. Later in the same chapter, John the Baptist referred to the regenerated ones in totality as the one bride of Christ (John 3:29-30). John seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I am not the Christ. I am not the one who comes to take the bride. Rather, He is the One, and you who are regenerated are the bride for Him. The One who takes the bride is the Bridegroom, and this Bridegroom has to increase, while I, who am not the Bridegroom, have to be reduced to nothing.&rdquo; Eventually, John the Baptist was reduced to nothing, even to the point of his physical death by being beheaded. When the Lord Jesus was put to death, however, He did not remain in death; He resurrected. In His resurrection, He brought many saved ones with Him and brought them forth to become parts of Him. When all these parts are put together, they become a bride as His counterpart.</p>
<p>The church is the bride of Christ, and according to typology, this bride is typified by Eve, who was Adam&rsquo;s counterpart. Eve was first a part of Adam. While Adam was sleeping, God opened his side and took out a rib. Then God built that rib into a woman by the name of Eve and brought her to Adam to be his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-23). Before this, Adam had given names to all the animals, but he had never found his counterpart. When he saw Eve, he declared, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:23). Eve is a picture of the church. The church came out of Christ as a part of Christ. The intrinsic essence of the church is the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ. He is the essence of the church because the church was His part. The church is not only composed of children born of God, but the church is also the bride, the counterpart of Christ, a part of Christ as Christ&rsquo;s increase.</p>
<p>Before Eve came into existence, she was a rib of Adam, a part of Adam. According to this revelation, we can say that before the church came into existence, she was a part of Christ. We may feel that this is too deep and beyond our comprehension, but even our physical body created by God is a wonder that we cannot comprehend. We should not trust in our mere mental comprehension of things. We need a revelation of the divine facts. The fact is that the church was a part of Christ before she came into existence. This is why every believer is a member of the Body of Christ. Just as the members of our physical body are parts of us, the members of Christ are parts of Christ. The divine life, the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ Himself, is the essence of the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
