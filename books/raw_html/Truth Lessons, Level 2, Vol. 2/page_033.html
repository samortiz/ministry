<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Esau and Jacob had the same parents; they were twins born of their father, Isaac, who was chosen by God, and of their mother, Rebekah, who was selected by the Holy Spirit. All that Esau and Jacob were and did are models and symbols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ESAU</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Symbolizing the Natural Man</h2>
<p>Esau was born the oldest son; hence, he was the first. In the Bible, the first, in the present sense, refers to that which is natural, of the old creation, and forsaken by God. For example, the Bible calls Adam &ldquo;the first man&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45, 47), indicating that he was natural and earthy, and that the earthy aspect of his being was rejected by God. In another example, the firstborn sons of the Egyptians were smitten by God (Exo. 12:12-13), signifying again that the first is forsaken by God. Esau, born the oldest son and being the first, symbolizes the natural man, who is hated by God (Rom. 9:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Symbolizing the Preference<br />
of the Natural Man</h2>
<p>Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; hence, he was the one most loved by his father according to the natural man. Isaac loved Esau because he often ate of Esau&rsquo;s venison (Gen. 25:27-28). When Isaac was old, he still asked Esau to go hunting and make him savory meat, which he loved, so that he could bless Esau before he died (Gen. 27:1-4). Isaac&rsquo;s love for Esau was altogether in the natural man and according to the natural taste. This indicates that what the natural man does by his natural strength (typified by Esau&rsquo;s hunting) is the preference of one who lives in the natural life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Despising and Losing the Birthright</h2>
<p>Although Esau was the firstborn, he despised the birthright. One day while Jacob was making pottage, Esau came from the field, and, feeling faint, he asked Jacob to give him some red pottage. However, Jacob demanded that Esau sell him his birthright before he would give him the red pottage. Esau said, &ldquo;Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?&rdquo; Then he swore to Jacob and sold his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29-34). Esau lusted after the enjoyment in the flesh, after the world and its worldly pleasures, and for a morsel of meat he sold his own birthright. Afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing of his father, Isaac, he was rejected, though he earnestly sought it with loud weeping; for he had no ground, no way, to reverse by repentance the result of what he had done (Gen. 27:30-38; Heb. 12:16-17). Thus Esau despised and lost his birthright.</p>
