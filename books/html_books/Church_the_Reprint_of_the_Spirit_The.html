<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This little book is composed of three messages given by Brother Witness Lee at the conclusion of the Hebrews training in the winter of 1975 in Anaheim, California.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAMPSTANDS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:31-39; Zech. 4:2-6, 10; Rev. 1:12-13, 20; 4:5; 5:6</h1>
<p>In this book we want to see the Spirit and the church. In our fellowship we want to focus our attention on the lampstands in Exodus 25, Zechariah 4, and Revelation 1. The first mention of the lampstand in the Bible is related to the tabernacle in the Old Testament (Exo. 25:31-39). The lampstand in the Holy Place, referred to in Hebrews 9:2, is one of the main items in the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE PAIRS OF ITEMS RELATED TO THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>The furniture related to the tabernacle is arranged in pairs. There are three pairs of items related to the tabernacle. First, are the altar (Exo. 27:1-8) and the laver (30:18-21) in the outer court, typifying the redeeming blood and the washing, cleansing Spirit. These two go together as one pair and are the initial experience of Christ. Second, are the showbread table on the north side and the lampstand on the south side in the Holy Place (Exo. 40:22, 24). The food of the showbread table is life, and the light of the lampstand is the light of life. &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). These two items form a pair for the continuing experience of Christ. The third pair of items in the tabernacle is the incense altar in the Holy Place and the ark in the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:4). The incense altar has to be one with the ark. On the ark is the propitiation-cover, which is the oracle where God speaks to man (Heb. 9:4-5; Rom. 3:25). This propitiation-cover is the throne of grace in the New Testament where we may take grace. Hebrews 12:28 says, &ldquo;Let us have grace,&rdquo; which may also be translated, &ldquo;Let us take grace.&rdquo; To take grace we have to come forward to the throne of grace. We take grace at the throne of grace, and the throne of grace is the propitiation-cover where God speaks to us and meets with us. We are accepted by God at the incense altar, and God speaks to us at the propitiation-cover of the ark. This is a picture of the traffic between God and man. Between the ark and the incense altar there is divine traffic, fellowship, communion. The first pair of items is the initial experience of Christ, the second pair is the continuation of the experience of Christ, and the final pair is the ultimate experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMPSTAND SIGNIFYING CHRIST,<br />
THE SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Among all the pieces of furniture in the tabernacle, the lampstand is the most peculiar. The altar, the showbread table, the incense altar, and the ark all have definite measurements, but the lampstand is without measurement. To describe the shape of the lampstand is not a simple matter. The laver is also without measurement, but is not as peculiar as the lampstand in that we can define its shape. The laver is shaped like a bowl so that it can contain water for the priests to wash with. There are no words, however, such as rectangular, square, triangular, or round to describe the shape of the lampstand. Furthermore, among the furniture in the tabernacle only the laver and the lampstand are without measurement. The laver is without measurement because it is a symbol of the life-giving Spirit. With the Spirit, there is no measurement. The Spirit is immeasurable, unlimited.</p>
<p>It is true to say that the lampstand typifies Christ, but we need to realize that Christ is the Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 is a strong verse telling us that the Lord is the Spirit. On one occasion, some of the brothers confronted certain ones who opposed us because we stood for the truth that Christ is the Spirit. One brother asked them if they believed the entire Bible. They said that they did, so the brother referred them to 2 Corinthians 3:17&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The brother asked, &ldquo;Who is the Lord?&rdquo;, and they said, &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; Then he asked, &ldquo;Who is the Spirit?&rdquo;, and they said, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Then the brother said, &ldquo;This means that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; These opposing ones were defeated by this one verse. Christ today is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The lampstand signifies Christ. No one can argue with this. But the lampstand also typifies something further. The &ldquo;nursery&rdquo; for all the seeds of the biblical truths is not only the book of Genesis but also the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch written by Moses. We cannot say that all the seeds of the truths were sown merely in Genesis. The first mention of the lampstand is not in Genesis but in Exodus (25:31-37). Then the lampstand is mentioned in 1 Kings as an item in the temple built by Solomon (7:49). Eventually, the lampstand is mentioned again in Zechariah related to the recovered temple (4:2). Zechariah is a record of the recovery of the destroyed temple. The lampstand in the tabernacle in Exodus signifies Christ Himself. But the lampstand in Zechariah signifies the Spirit. Zechariah 4 tells us that when Zechariah saw the lampstand, he asked the angel what this was. Then the angel answered, &ldquo;This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (v. 6). The Lord told Zechariah that the lampstand was His Spirit. In Exodus the lampstand was Christ. In Zechariah the lampstand was the Spirit.</p>
<p>As the seed of the truth concerning the lampstand in Exodus, the lampstand is Christ. The growth of this seed in Zechariah is that the lampstand is the Spirit. In Revelation is the harvest of the truth concerning the lampstand. The seed was one lampstand and the harvest is seven lampstands. The harvest is always a multiplication of the seed, so the seed has been multiplied from one into seven. The seed is Christ, the growth is the Spirit, and the harvest is the church. Hallelujah for Christ, the Spirit, and the church! The lampstand first signifies Christ, then the Spirit, and ultimately the church. This indicates that the very Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit with the very Christ produces the churches. The lampstand in Exodus, the lampstand in Zechariah, and the lampstands in Revelation are three stages of the truth concerning the lampstand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE REPRODUCTION OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE REPRINT OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many religious people think that the church is a physical building, perhaps with a high tower and a bell. When people say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to church,&rdquo; they are referring to a physical building of bricks, stones, wood, and steel. My impression of the church as a youngster growing up in China was that it was a western bungalow with a high tower and a bell. When the bell would ring, my mother would tell us that it was time to go to church. To say that a physical building is the church is absolutely and thoroughly off from the divine revelation of the church. When John Wesley preached outdoors in England in the eighteenth century, he was opposed by the so-called Anglican Church, the Church of England. They accused him of making the holy Word profane since to them the holy Word should only be taught in a holy place, a sanctuary, a dedicated place. They were appalled that John Wesley would preach the holy Word on the street corners. They considered that the physical building was the church.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century the Brethren were raised up by the Lord. They saw that the church was not a physical building and that the word <em>church</em> in Greek was <em>ekklesia,</em> which means the gathering of the called-out ones. They referred to the church as the assembly. The Assembly of God followed the Brethren in this matter. I also prefer to use the word <em>assembly</em> because the word <em>church</em> has been fully spoiled, damaged, and polluted. But to say that the church as an <em>ekklesia</em> is the gathering of the called-out ones of God is still a definition of the church that is too superficial.</p>
<p>The Brethren also saw the Body of Christ. After the Brethren, some saints were raised up by the Lord who saw something concerning Christ as our inner life. They also saw that the church is the Body of Christ as an organism (Eph. 1:22-23). The church is not merely a gathering but a divine organism, the Body. Based upon this, some began to see that the church is the continuation of Christ, the enlargement of Christ, and the spreading of Christ. The church is also the fullness of Christ (1:22-23) and the fullness of God (3:19).</p>
<p>We need to realize that we have been born of God (John 1:12-13). Those human beings who have been born of God, today are the sons of God. Regeneration means that God has been born into our being. Now we have God&rsquo;s divine life (1 John 5:11-12) and divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). How could we be the continuation of Christ, the enlargement of Christ, or the spreading of Christ unless we have Christ in us (Col. 1:27), unless we are a part of Christ (Eph. 5:30)? It is only possible for us to be Christ&rsquo;s continuation, Christ&rsquo;s Body, if we have Christ within us. The Body of Christ is surely a part of Christ. The church has Christ within. The church has the life of Christ and the nature of Christ, so the church is the Body of Christ, the continuation of Christ, the enlargement of Christ, and the spreading of Christ.</p>
<p>For centuries, however, no one has seen, not even the deeper saints, that the church is the reproduction of Christ. We can say this because the lampstand in Exodus was one, and the lampstands in Revelation are seven. The one lampstand has been reproduced. The unique lampstand in Exodus became a model, out of which came seven lampstands. The seven lampstands are exactly the same as the unique lampstand in nature, essence, shape, and in every respect. Cakes may be made by putting the batter into a mold. By using the mold the same cake may be made again and again. Christ is the mold and the church is the reproduction of Christ. What is the church today? To say that the church is the Body, and the continuation, the enlargement, and the spreading of Christ is not enough. We all have to see that the church is an exact reproduction of Christ. Christ was the unique lampstand, and all the churches are the lampstands in the same nature, essence, model, shape, and function. According to the lampstand in Exodus we can say that the church is the reproduction of Christ, and according to the lampstand in Zechariah the church is the reprint of the Spirit. The ultimate definition of the church is that the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we say that we are the church, we have to realize that the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit. When we say that we are the church, we must realize that we have to be fully in the Spirit. Even if we are only partially in the flesh, we become a poor reproduction, a poor reprint. When we brothers and sisters come together, if we all are in the Spirit, we are the church. If we are outside of the Spirit, we are not the church. Whether or not we are actually the church depends upon whether or not we are in the Spirit. If we are in the Spirit, we are the church. We have to admit that when we are outside of the Spirit, we are merely the fallen race and the descendants of Adam. None of us in our natural being is a dove. The dove is the Spirit. Are we standing as the church in our locality? Then we must be in the Spirit. If we are not in the Spirit, we are through with the church because the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the Lord can be seen in the book of Revelation. He knows that a picture is better than a thousand words. Before He wrote the seven epistles to the seven churches, He showed John a picture of seven golden lampstands (Rev. 1:11-12). What is the church? The church is the lampstand. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we all have to see that the church is so high and so pure. The church is nothing less than Christ and the Spirit because both Christ and the Spirit are the lampstand and the church is also the lampstand. This is a picture of regeneration and transformation. Christ has been regenerated into our being, and we are being fully transformed into His Being (2 Cor. 3:18). He is the lampstand and the church is also the lampstand. We have to see what the church is to such an extent. If we see this vision of the church, we will be afraid to exercise our flesh. We need to see that the church is absolutely something of Christ and in the Spirit. It is the lampstand, a reproduction of Christ and a reprint of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAMPSTANDS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">For God&rsquo;s Building in Three Stages</h2>
<p>The lampstands are for God&rsquo;s building in three stages: for the tabernacle, or temple (Exo. 25:31-39); for the recovered temple (Zech. 4:2-6); and for the church (Rev. 1:12-13, 20). In other words, for God to build the tabernacle, there was the need of the lampstand, for God to rebuild the temple there was the need of the lampstand, and for God to build the church today there is the need of the lampstand. All the lampstands are golden, which means that they are divine, and all are without measure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lamps for Giving Light and<br />
the Light for Moving</h2>
<p>The lamps of the lampstand are for giving light and the light is for moving (John 9:4-5; 8:12). There was no window in the tabernacle. If there had been no lampstand in the tabernacle, the priest would have been in the dark and would have lost his direction. He would not have known what to do, how to do things, or where to go. Thus, the whole move in the tabernacle depended upon the shining lampstand. This indicates that the shining lampstand is not for nourishing, not for strengthening, not for watering, and not for acceptance, but for moving. The showbread table is for nourishing, the incense altar is for acceptance, but only the lampstand is for moving. God&rsquo;s building is God&rsquo;s moving. God has a building. God is moving on. For the moving on there is the need of the shining light. If you stay away from the church life for one month, you will see that you are in the gloom, losing your direction, not knowing what to do, how to do things, or where to go. You will come to a standstill. The church is the lampstand shining for all of us to move. When we came into the church life, we can testify that we began to know how to do things, what to do, and where to go because the church is the lampstand, shining for all of us to move.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Seven Being the Number<br />
for Completion in God&rsquo;s Move</h2>
<p>In Revelation there are seven lampstands, and each lampstand has seven lamps. Twelve is the number for absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&rsquo;s administration, but seven is the number for completion in God&rsquo;s move. There were seven days for creation with its rest (Gen. 1:31&mdash;2:3). Creation was God&rsquo;s first move. There are seven dispensations for God&rsquo;s move with man. These dispensations are the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom. There were seventy years, ten times seven, for the dispersion of Israel in the Old Testament (Jer. 25:11). There are seventy weeks for God&rsquo;s economy with Israel (Dan. 9:24-27). Those seventy weeks are divided into three sections: the first section is seven weeks, the second section is sixty-two weeks, and the third section is the final one week. Each week signifies seven years.</p>
<p>The seven lampstands are the seven churches, indicating that the churches are the completion in God&rsquo;s move. The seven seals in Revelation are for the destiny of the earth (Rev. 5:5), the seven trumpets are for tribulation upon the earth (Rev. 8:2), and the seven bowls are for the wrath of God upon the earth (Rev. 15:7). The destination of the earth, the tribulation of the earth, and the wrath upon the earth are all in seven because they are all items in God&rsquo;s move.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Lamps Being the Seven Eyes</h2>
<p>The seven lamps are the seven eyes (Zech. 4:2, 10). The seven lamps are first seen in Exodus, and the seven eyes are first seen in Zechariah. These seven eyes are of Christ as the Lamb for redemption (Rev. 5:6), of Christ as the stone for God&rsquo;s building (Zech. 3:9), and of Jehovah for the visitation of man (4:10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Lamps and the Seven Eyes<br />
Being the Seven Spirits of God</h2>
<p>The seven lamps and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5; 5:6). The seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God. The lamps are for enlightening. The eyes are for transfusion by looking. You may know whether a person is happy or angry with you by looking at his eyes. The Lord has seven eyes for the purpose of transfusing all that He is into us. The seven Spirits are for moving and working. As seven is the number for completion in God&rsquo;s operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God&rsquo;s move on the earth. In substance and existence, God&rsquo;s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s Spirit is sevenfold. It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2. In existence it is one lampstand, but in function it is seven lamps. Because the church has become degraded and the age is dark, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God is needed for God&rsquo;s move and work on the earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4:24; Matt. 28:19; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Matt. 3:11; John 1:33; Acts 1:5; Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3; 1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:4</h1>
<p>We have seen that there are three categories of the lampstand in Exodus, Zechariah, and Revelation, respectively. These lampstands are all related to God&rsquo;s building, and God&rsquo;s building is God&rsquo;s move. First, God&rsquo;s move was with Christ; then this very Christ became the life-giving Spirit for God&rsquo;s move, for God&rsquo;s building. Eventually, the many reprints of this life-giving Spirit are the churches. The first lampstand in Exodus signifies Christ, the second lampstand in Zechariah symbolizes the Spirit, and eventually in the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the seven lampstands are the seven local churches. A picture is better than a thousand words. This picture of the lampstands in three stages shows us Christ, the Spirit, and the churches. The churches are the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit. No word can be uttered that is so impressive and so meaningful as this picture concerning the church.</p>
<p>We need some further fellowship to help us realize that the church in the New Testament is absolutely a matter in the Spirit. Many people talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but not many realize that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter absolutely related to the church. The baptism in the Spirit is to bring forth the church. In the New Testament the baptism in the Spirit is for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ECONOMY OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The first main item that we need to see is the economy of the divine Spirit. When we refer to the divine Spirit, we mean the all-inclusive, divine Spirit. First, substantially speaking, God is Spirit. God is Spirit, and this Spirit is the substance of God. A wooden table is a table for function, but substantially it is wood. John 4:24 does not say that God is <em>the</em> Spirit but that God is Spirit because Spirit indicates God&rsquo;s substance.</p>
<p>Dispensationally, the third of the Triune God is the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The final One, the ultimate One, of the Triune God is the Spirit. The Trinity of God is not a matter for doctrinal study but is altogether for God to dispense Himself into humanity. Thus, the Trinity of God is a dispensational matter.</p>
<p>For imparting life, the redeeming Christ became the life-giving Spirit (John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). First Corinthians 15:45 tells us that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam refers to Christ, who was incarnated as a man to be our Redeemer. In the beginning was the Word, the Word became flesh, and this One was the Lamb of God (John 1:1, 14, 29). For God to be incarnate as a man is for Him to be the Lamb of God, our Redeemer, to take away sin. After He accomplished redemption on the cross, He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to impart Himself into us as life (1 Cor. 15:45). Christ became two items in two steps. In the step of incarnation He became the flesh for redemption, and in the second step of resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit for life-giving, for imparting life. Sin is gone, and life is here. Two main points in the book of Hebrews are that sin was put away (9:26) and life was brought in (7:16). Now we have the law of life working in us (8:10) to make us His reproduction. He was incarnated to be our Redeemer to take away our sin, and He was resurrected to be the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life. First, God is Spirit; second, the last person of the Trinity is the Spirit; and third, the Redeemer became the life-giving Spirit. Thus, today totally and all-inclusively our God is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZING PEOPLE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The second main item is the matter of baptizing people in the Spirit (Matt. 3:11; John 1:33; Acts 1:5). The Lord has baptized all God&rsquo;s chosen people in the Spirit. Our God today is totally and all-inclusively the Spirit, and He has prepared everything to baptize His chosen people into Himself. Matthew 28:19 tells us clearly that to be baptized is to be baptized into the Triune God. We are charged to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. When a person is baptized in water, he is dipped into the water, put into the water. Thus, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be put into the Triune God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to be put into the Triune God is to be put into Christ. Matthew 28:19 tells us that we are baptized into the Triune God. Galatians 3:27 and Romans 6:3 tell us that we are baptized into Christ. To be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the Triune God.</p>
<p>How we thank the Lord for 1 Corinthians 12:13! This is one of the greatest verses in the Bible. It says that &ldquo;we were all baptized into one body.&rdquo; We have been baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the Body. Into the Triune God means into Christ, and into Christ means into the Body.</p>
<p>We need to know when and where we were baptized. We were baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the Body approximately nineteen and a half centuries ago. If you are a Jew, you were baptized on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2. If you are a Gentile, you were baptized in the house of Cornelius in Acts 10. Baptism is a bequest that is according to God&rsquo;s will. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we <em>were</em> all baptized into one body.&rdquo; Before we were born, we were baptized. We need to take this bequest according to the will and give the Lord thanks. I not only believe this divine fact, but I also am enjoying it. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I am daily and even hourly in the experience of the baptism in the Spirit. We have to enjoy the baptism in the Spirit. We have the bequests of the new testament, the new covenant, and we have to enjoy them. If we had a bequest of ten million dollars in the bank, we would enjoy the fortune we have by spending it. In like manner, we have the new covenant, which is a will with many wonderful bequests. The baptism in the Spirit is one of these marvelous bequests that we can receive and enjoy today. We have been put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the church, the Body.</p>
<p>We need to see that before we came into the church, we were put into the church already. If we had not been put into the church, we could not have come into the church. This is heavenly language. Do you know why you came into the church? Because before you were born, you had already been put into the church. A certain brother may have been born physically in 1941 in the United States. But he actually came to the United States two hundred years before when his great-grandparents immigrated from Scotland. If he had not been brought to the United States two hundred years before, he could not have been born in the United States in 1941. This is the divine way of reckoning things. Hebrews tells us that Levi paid tithes to Melchisedec because he was in the loins of his father, Abraham, when Melchisedec met Abraham (7:9-10). When were we put into the church? We should learn to speak the heavenly language. We were put into the church nineteen and a half centuries ago, and we are enjoying the church today. We were all put into the church at the same time, but you may not have been enjoying the church as long as another brother. I have been enjoying the church for fifty years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT FOR THE BODY</h2>
<p>The third main item we need to see is the Spirit for the Body. The Spirit is for many positive items of the Christian life, but ultimately the Spirit is for the Body. The Spirit is for regeneration, sanctification, transformation, life, power, and so many spiritual items, but all of these items are altogether for one issue&mdash;the Body. Regeneration, sanctification, transformation, life, power, and every positive spiritual blessing are for the Body. If we miss the Body, we miss everything. If we miss the Body, we miss the mark and the goal of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Spirit is for the Body, so 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, and Ephesians 4:4 says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; The one Spirit equals the one Body, and the one Body equals the one Spirit. Thus, it is absolutely correct to say that the church is the reprint of the Spirit. &ldquo;No Spirit, no church. More Spirit, more church.&rdquo; This is because the church is the reprint of the Spirit. The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, and the church is the reprint of the Spirit, the corporate expression of the processed Triune God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
THE REPRINT OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 4:2-6, 10; 3:9; Rev. 1:12-13, 20; 4:5; 5:6; 1:4, 2, 9; 2:7; 3:22; 22:17; 19:10</h1>
<p>The Bible is consistent in God&rsquo;s economy. If we have not seen the significance of God&rsquo;s economy, we will not be able to get into the real significance of the whole Bible. We may read it again and again without realizing its central thought. When the Lord opens our eyes to see God&rsquo;s economy, the economy of God immediately becomes a key for us to open the entire Bible. Without such a key, it is hard for us to understand the holy Word. To open everything in the Bible, we need this constant key.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE REPRINT OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the past we knew something concerning the lampstand in the tabernacle, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, He has shown us something further. The lampstand was sown as a seed in Exodus. Then the growth of this seed can be seen in Zechariah. Eventually, the harvest of the truth concerning the lampstand is in the last book of the Bible, Revelation. There is hardly anything new in the book of Revelation. Most of the items in Revelation were already sown in the Old Testament. Years ago, I saw the lampstand in Exodus and the seven lampstands in Revelation. But for many years I did not see that the lampstands in Revelation are the harvest of the lampstand sown in Exodus as a seed. It was not until 1975 that I saw the relationship between the three categories of lampstands: the lampstand for God&rsquo;s building of the tabernacle and the temple; the lampstand for the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s temple; and the lampstands for the building of the church.</p>
<p>I first saw that in Zechariah the lampstand is presented mainly to signify the need of the Spirit for God&rsquo;s building and especially for God&rsquo;s rebuilding. In a sense, the building of the church today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a kind of rebuilding. That is why we need a recovery. In church history something got lost that needs to be recovered. When I saw that the lampstand in Zechariah signifies the need of the Spirit for the Lord&rsquo;s rebuilding of His temple, I went back to see the lampstand in Exodus, and I went forward to see the lampstands in Revelation. Then I saw that the lampstand in Exodus signifying Christ became the lampstand in Zechariah signifying the Spirit. Eventually, the lampstands in Revelation are the reprint, the reproduction, of this Spirit-Christ.</p>
<p>Years ago I discovered that the lampstand in Exodus 25 was a type of Christ and that Christ bore the lamps shining with oil. I also found out that the oil signifies the Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). As the lampstand, Christ has the oil, which means that He has the Spirit. Later I realized that eventually this Christ who was the lampstand, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Exodus 25 shows us, on the one hand, that the lampstand signifies Christ as the embodiment of God. Zechariah 4, on the other hand, shows us that the lampstand signifies the life-giving Spirit as the reality of Christ. God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the Spirit. Both this Christ, who is the embodiment of God, and this Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, signify the lampstand. Eventually and ultimately in the Bible, the churches are brought forth into existence, or produced, and every church is a lampstand.</p>
<p>We need to look at this picture. By looking at this picture we can understand that every local church is a reprint of the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, who is the embodiment of God. God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is reprinted in the church. Thus, the church is the reprint of the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, who is the embodiment of God.</p>
<p>The way that this vision can be experienced is by regeneration and transformation. We need to be clear about the real significance of regeneration. Regeneration is for human beings to be born of God, to be born of the divine life with the divine nature (John 1:12-13; 1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet. 1:4). Thus, the sons of men become the sons of God. We who have been born of God can say, &ldquo;On the one hand, I am a son of man, and on the other hand, I am a son of God!&rdquo; We have been born of God with His life and His nature. The basic element for us to be the church is the divine life with the divine nature. If we did not have the divine life with the divine nature, we could never be the church. The divine life, of which we have been born again, is nothing less than God Himself in Christ to be our life (John 1:4; 14:6). At the time we were reborn, God came into us, and we now have God in Christ within us as our life and as our nature. Because we have the divine life with the divine nature, we can be the church. The church is a living composition of the divine life with the divine nature.</p>
<p>With our physical body, there should be no foreign element. If some foreign element comes into our body, this will result in sickness. Our physical body will not receive any substance that is foreign to its life and nature. In like manner, the Body of Christ, the church, will not take any foreign substance. Anything that is not born of the divine life with the divine nature is foreign to the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ will not take it. This tells us that our natural man is not good for the Body of Christ. Our natural will, our natural emotion, our natural mind, and anything of ours that is natural is not good for the church, and the church as the Body of Christ will not take it. Our natural mind, our natural thinking, our natural love, our natural attributes, and our natural ability are altogether not acceptable to the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is a living composition of the divine life with the divine nature.</p>
<p>Among all the furniture in the tabernacle, the lamp-stand was unique. Nearly every piece of furniture in the tabernacle had wood, except for the laver, which was made of brass. The altar, the showbread table, the incense altar, and the ark were all made of acacia wood overlaid with brass or gold. But the lampstand had no wood. It was altogether one piece of pure gold. Although the laver had no wood, it also had no gold since it was made of brass. The lampstand was a pure piece of gold, and the church is the reprint of the lampstand. Thus, the wood has to be eliminated. The wood has to be reduced. When the church is seen as the testimony of Jesus in Revelation, all the churches are pure golden lampstands because every local church is a reproduction of Christ, and Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>If our eyes are opened by the Lord, and we see this vision concerning the church, this vision will be better than a thousand messages concerning the church. If you have really seen this vision, you will not exercise your mind to argue with the brothers in your locality. When the sisters are exercising their emotions to do something, this vision will terminate them. Even at the dining table this vision will be shining to govern us. We need a governing vision that terminates, kills, and annuls everything of our natural man. When a brother is about to exchange words with his wife, this vision will terminate him. When you are about to vindicate yourself, the Lord may say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;natural!&rdquo; If this vision is shining so brightly within us, the Lord will have a way to speak to us in our daily life to terminate our natural man. He will be able to say: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;natural love! What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;natural thinking! What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;your natural man! What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;natural, natural, natural!&rdquo; Everything that is natural has to go. Otherwise, we actually are not in the church. Although you were put into the church nineteen and a half centuries ago, actually today you may not be in the church. Where are you? You may be in the natural life. We have to rise up to testify that the church is the reprint of the Spirit. We need to testify, &ldquo;From now on, my natural being has no share in the church, no part in the church, because I have seen that the church is the reprint of the Spirit!&rdquo; The church as the lampstand is pure and without mixture. The church is the embodiment of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit.</p>
<p>There is no comparison between the church and the denominations. The church is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones (Rev. 21:18-21). The church has nothing to do with the materials of wood, hay, and stubble produced by us in the natural man and the flesh (1 Cor. 3:12). We need to be warned in this matter. We should not insult the church by behaving and acting by our natural life. If we are in the church and still behave, act, and move by our natural being, by our natural life, this is an insult to the church life. The &ldquo;good manners&rdquo; for the church life is our reborn, indwelt spirit (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). In our spirit, we have the reprint of the divine Spirit, which is the church in practicality. May the Lord open our eyes to see what the church is!</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAMPSTAND<br />
IN THE TABERNACLE AND THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>The lampstand in the tabernacle emphasizes Christ with the seven Spirits of God for God&rsquo;s building (Exo. 25:31-39). The lampstand for the recovered temple emphasizes the Spirit as the seven Spirits of Jehovah for God&rsquo;s building (Zech. 4:2-6, 10). In Exodus the lampstand emphasizes Christ. In Zechariah the lampstand emphasizes the Spirit. This is because the New Testament tells us that the redeeming Christ has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the redeeming One, He was Christ and as the life-giving One, He is the Spirit. Thus, both Christ and the Spirit are the lampstand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMPSTANDS FOR THE CHURCHES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Seven Lamps, the Seven Eyes, and<br />
the Seven Spirits</h2>
<p>The lampstands for the churches emphasize the church with Christ and with the Spirit (Rev. 1:12-13, 20). The wonderful church is with Christ and with the Spirit. The lampstand in Exodus, which typifies Christ, had seven lamps, and these seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, Jehovah (Zech. 4:10). In Psalm 32:8 the Lord says, &ldquo;I will guide thee with mine eye.&rdquo; I was always taught that God had two eyes, but Revelation and Zechariah tell us that God has seven eyes. God has seven eyes and these seven eyes are mainly for God&rsquo;s moving, for God&rsquo;s working. How needed a person&rsquo;s eyes are! We need eyes so that we can walk properly, move properly, and work properly. God&rsquo;s eyes are for God&rsquo;s move, for God&rsquo;s work. Christ has seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of God.</p>
<p>The seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ as the Lamb and as the stone (Zech. 4:2, 10; Rev. 5:6; Zech. 3:9). Zechariah 3 tells us that Christ as the building stone has seven eyes, and Revelation 5 tells us that Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven eyes. This proves that the Lamb is the stone and the stone is the Lamb. The Lamb is for redemption, and the stone is for building. For the purposes of redemption and building, Christ has seven eyes.</p>
<p>Eventually, the seven lamps and the seven eyes of Christ are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5; 5:6). We have seen that the seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of Christ as the Lamb and as the stone, are also the seven eyes of Jehovah. Thus, the seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of the Lamb, of the stone, and of the Lord Jehovah. The Lamb is the stone, and the stone is the Lord Jehovah. The Lord Jehovah, who is the stone and the Lamb, has the seven Spirits; the seven Spirits are the seven eyes; and the seven eyes are the seven lamps. In other words, the seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of the Lord Jehovah, who is the building stone and the redeeming Lamb. Thus, there are six items related to the lampstand: the seven lamps, the seven eyes, the seven Spirits, the Lord Jehovah, the stone, and the Lamb. The Lord, who is also called the stone and the Lamb, has the seven Spirits, the seven eyes, the seven lamps. When the seven lamps enlighten us, the seven eyes look at us. When the seven eyes look at us, they work in us, move in us, and even move us as the seven Spirits. While the seven Spirits are working in us, the Lamb is there, the stone is there, and the Lord is there.</p>
<p>The church is the totality of the Lamb for redemption, of the stone for building, of the Lord for administration, of the seven Spirits for moving, of the seven eyes for looking at us, and of the seven lamps for enlightening us. While the seven lamps are enlightening us, the seven eyes are looking at us; while the seven eyes are looking at us, the seven Spirits are moving in us. When the seven Spirits are moving in us, the Lamb is here for redemption, the stone is here for building, and the Lord is here for His administration.</p>
<p>This wonderful truth matches our experience in the church life. When we come into the church, the seven lamps are shining within us and enlightening us. At the same time, we have the deep sensation that someone is watching over us. This One who is watching over us has seven eyes. He is watching over us from every side&mdash;not only from the right, left, front, back, top, and bottom, but also from within. We have no way to hide ourselves. Many times in the church life we may want to hide ourselves, but we find that &ldquo;the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good&rdquo; (Prov. 15:3). Wherever we are, the eyes of the Lord are. When we were in the religious world, it might have been easy for us to hide ourselves in the gloom. But now that we have come into the church life, where are we going to hide ourselves? Nowhere! There are always seven eyes watching over us.</p>
<p>We also have the experience that while the seven eyes are watching over us and looking at us, what grace, supply, encouragement, and support are infused into us! The looking of the seven eyes is not mainly for watching but for transfusing. When the seven eyes look at us, the divine element is transfused into us. The divine looking transfuses the divine element! What we are fellowshipping here is not something doctrinal, but is according to our experiences of Christ in the church. When we receive the Lord&rsquo;s transfusion, many times we have to confess our failures, sins, and weaknesses to the Lord. Then we enjoy the Lamb, the redeeming One. Building follows redemption. The more we confess our sins, failures, and weaknesses, the more we will be brought into the building, the practical and actual building in the local church. In this way, we experience the Lamb and the stone. Furthermore, when we are brought into the practical building, we will see that He is Jehovah, the Lord, and everything to us. We will experience all that He is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seven Spirits of God for the Seven Churches</h2>
<p>The seven Spirits of God are for the seven churches (Rev. 1:4). The Spirit is the reality of Christ (John 14:17-20; 16:13-15), and the church is the reprint of the Spirit (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 22:17). The church with the Spirit is the embodiment of Christ, the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9; 19:10). The more Spirit, the more church, the more testimony of Jesus!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE CHURCHES TO BE IDENTICAL</h2>
<p>The lampstands, the churches, as the testimony of Jesus in Revelation are golden and shining (1:12-13). All the seven lampstands are exactly the same. If the seven lampstands were placed together, we would not be able to discern one from another. I hope that the day will come when all the local churches on this earth are identical to each other in reality. Then it would even be hard for Satan to find out which church is which. The church in Anaheim, the church in Frankfurt, the church in New York, and the church in Taipei would all be the same.</p>
<p>There is only one Spirit and one Body (Eph. 4:4), but there are many local churches as the expression of the one Body. Although the lampstands signifying the local churches are many, they are all identical. The seven lampstands in Revelation 1 represent seven cities: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. The localities are different, but the lampstands are the same. Surely London is different from Frankfurt. But the two local churches in these two cities must be identical. The New Testament does not tell us that the local churches should be different. Paul did not teach the churches in Galatia in one way and the church in Colossae in another way. He said that he taught the same thing in every church (1 Cor. 4:17).</p>
<p>I do expect that the day will come when all the local churches look alike, and I believe that when that day comes, the Lord will return. What a lie it is to say that every local church must be unique! If any local church is unique, it is unique in a negative sense. The church in Pergamos was unique with the teaching of Balaam (Rev. 2:14), and the church in Thyatira was unique with Jezebel (2:20). The local churches in Revelation were unique in their negative aspects. But the seven churches as the lampstands are identical to one another in a positive sense. Unless the lampstands were numbered, one would not be able to identify one lampstand from another. The lampstands are all reprints of the same Spirit.</p>
<p>Every printed copy of a certain document is a reprint of the original typeset version of that document. If a thousand copies are made, they are identical to one another. Likewise, the church is the reprint of the Spirit. We can experience the church in this aspect by the enlightening of the seven lamps, the divine looking of the seven eyes, and the moving and working of the seven Spirits. Then we have to make a thorough confession to the Lord to apply His redemption, and then we will be brought into the actual building. Eventually, we are all in the church, and the church is the reprint of the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that the fellowship in this book will be a governing vision to us. This vision needs to be shining over us and within us as the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits. This vision will bring us actually into the building of the church, and eventually all the local churches on this earth will be identical to one another. When this happens on the earth, I believe we will be ready for Him to come back. O Lord Jesus! Come quickly! There is no other way to bring Him back and no other way to get ourselves ready but by seeing, experiencing, and enjoying the church as the reprint of the Spirit.</p></body></html>
