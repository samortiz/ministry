   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MINISTRY OF INSCRIBING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the Spirit and righteousness are the two aspects of the essence which is inscribed into us by the ministry of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The living Spirit is the inward aspect, and the perfect righteousness is the outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The essence of the new covenant ministry includes the two aspects of the Spirit and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our ministry in the local churches must be a ministry of inscribing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It should not be mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we only teach others, the divine essence will not be inscribed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Teaching does not require any essence; however, inscribing does require an essence, just as writing with a pen requires ink.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you try to write with an empty pen, there will be no words on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to write, we must have the ink as the writing essence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then the more we write, the more words will be inscribed on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, we must have the divine essence in order to inscribe it into the being of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ministry of inscribing is unique, and the essence used for inscribing is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter did not do one kind of inscribing with one kind of essence, and Paul a different kind of inscribing with a different kind of essence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, the apostles were not divided; neither were they divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, they all practiced the same inscribing with the same essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, today s preachers have different kinds of inscribing, different kinds of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, the more they teach and preach, the more divisions are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the unique inscribing must be with the unique essence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AS THE UNIQUE ESSENCE INSCRIBED INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the unique essence which needs to be inscribed into the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This unique essence is the Triune God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The term the Spirit as used in the New Testament is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit denotes the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis 1:2 we read of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Elsewhere the Old Testament speaks of the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament the term the Holy Spirit is used.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in Acts 16:7 lit. we read of the Spirit of Jesus; in Romans 8:9, of the Spirit of Christ; and in Philippians 1:19, of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Romans 8 we are charged to walk in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament the emphasis is not on walking in the Holy Spirit or in the Spirit of God; the emphasis is on walking in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, at the end of the Bible, in Revelation 22:17, we read of the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, the Bible ends with a word not about the Spirit of God, nor about the Holy Spirit, but about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit in Revelation 22:17 is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I realize that it is troubling to the religious mind to speak of God being processed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can remember the first time I used the word processed concerning the Triune God in a message.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Afterwards, I wondered if I had been too bold in saying that God is processed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In that message I pointed out that God today is no longer unprocessed, no longer the raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today God is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But after I considered this matter further and prayed regarding it, I had the sense deep within, I believe of the Spirit, that if I did not use the word processed, I had no better term to use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said to myself, If you don t use such words as raw and processed, how will you be able to give messages concerning the Triune God as your enjoyment?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How will you be able to express the truth concerning the steps through which God has passed to become the all-inclusive Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you timid, afraid of being opposed and criticized?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, after much prayer and consideration, I felt confirmed in using this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Recently, we have learned that William Law and Andrew Murray also used this term in their writings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible certain words are not used; however, there are facts which give us reason to use particular words to describe them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, the word Trinity cannot be found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, the Bible reveals the fact of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is one God, but He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this not the Trinity?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Certainly it is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Trinity actually does not mean three in one; it means three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The adjective form of the word trinity is triune, composed of two Latin roots: tri-, meaning three, and -une, meaning one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, triune means three-one, not three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the Bible reveals that God is triune, what is wrong with using the word Trinity to speak of God as the Father, Son, and Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must have some word to express the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same principle, the Bible does not use the word processed with respect to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, the Bible reveals the fact of God s process.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As I was struggling over the use of the word processed, I considered Christ s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ, the eternal God, was conceived in the womb of a virgin and was born in a manger in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He then lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, He was crucified and buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After visiting Hades, He came forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As I considered all this, I said to myself, If this is not a process, then what is it?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since it is a process, you must be bold to use this term in your messages.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is wrong in saying that God today is the processed God, that He is no longer the unprocessed God, the raw God?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you catch a fish and bring it home, that fish is raw.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But after you cook it and serve it on the dining table for a meal, it is no longer a raw fish.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is now a processed fish.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our God is no longer raw.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Genesis 1 He was the raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Actually, throughout the entire Old Testament He was raw.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He had not yet been cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He had not yet been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The incarnation of Christ was part of His process.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His being conceived in the womb of Mary and His being born in Bethlehem were aspects of this process.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For nine months the Lord Jesus was in the womb of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When He was crucified, He was on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He then was in the tomb for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Is not all this a process?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some may say that the Lord s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection were simply procedures, not a process.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>According to this understanding, incarnation was a procedure by which God became a man, and crucifixion was a procedure by which our Redeemer died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But even if you change the word process to procedure, the facts remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Furthermore, this procedure, if you call it that, is actually a process.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the New Testament the Spirit signifies the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Actually the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have seen that Revelation 22:17 says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There is no expression in human language greater than this.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married and become a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This means that the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man become one.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>What a wedding that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It will be the greatest wedding in the universe, and we all are invited to participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Spirit as the processed Triune God is the essence inscribed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Because this essence has been inscribed into us, we cannot remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Transformation is taking place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Perhaps even as you have been reading this message, something of the divine essence has been inscribed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You may not remember the points of the message, but what has been inscribed into you of the divine essence will never be erased.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The divine essence that has been inscribed into us throughout the years in the local churches will have a particular expression, and this expression is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When we have righteousness as the expression of the essence inscribed into us, we become right with God, with others, and with everything in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This means that the indwelling God becomes our righteousness to be our appearance, our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This expression is God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This Spirit and this righteousness are the essence of the new covenant ministry.</S>
