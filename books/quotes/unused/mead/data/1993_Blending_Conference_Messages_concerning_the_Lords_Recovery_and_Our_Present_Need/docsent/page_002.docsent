   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE ONE THE LORD'S RECOVERY OUTLINE The Lord's recovery being the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures the holy Word of God 2 Tim 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's recovery of the truths being of two categories: The category of the major items for the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The category of the minor items for the practices of the believers and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery: The all-inclusive Christ having the preeminence in all things, filling all in all, being the centrality and the universality of God's economy, allotted to the saints as their redemption, life, life-supply, and everything for them to participate in His riches for their enjoyment and be constituted with His divine element that they may become His members to live Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The consummated Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power, to be the life-giving and indwelling Spirit as the reality, the realization, of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The eternal life, the uncreated life, the divine life, incorruptible and indestructible, the very Triune God the Father in the Son as the Spirit to be life to His redeemed children with which they are regenerated, renewed, transformed, conformed to His glorious image, and glorified with Himself as the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church, the called-out assembly, as the house of God composed of all His children and expressed in many localities on the earth as the local churches; and as the universal Body of Christ constituted with Christ as its divine element and composed of all the believers of Christ as its human members in the organic union with Christ in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The oneness of the Body of Christ, the oneness of the one Spirit as the unique essence of the Body, with the one Lord as the unique element of the Body and with the one Father as the unique source of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the oneness of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, undivided and indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ground of the church the oneness of the universal Body of Christ expressed on the ground of each locality of the local churches in which they are located respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the Lord sent me to the United States, I began the ministry here in December 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From that time until the present a little more than thirty years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the first conference I emphasized the term "the Lord's recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I told the dear saints that the Lord sent me to this country for nothing but His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the ministry has continued to stress the matter of the Lord's recovery throughout these years, according to my observation, even some dear saints who have been with us for many years are still not clear concerning what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because there are many new ones and young ones in the recovery, I feel very burdened concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to speak about the Lord's recovery, to fellowship about the recovery, and to make transactions among ourselves concerning the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are here for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The purpose of the seven messages in this book is to make the Lord's recovery clear to all the saints.</S>
