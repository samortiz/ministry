<h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>(Parts omitted.) Brother Tseng Da-guang's wife contracted encephalitis after giving birth to twins on the twenty-second of this month. She passed away on the twenty-sixth. Sister Lie Shi Sai-ho was knocked over by a boy riding a bicycle on the sidewalk last Wednesday. At the time it was very serious, but after a few days of treatment, she recovered completely and has already returned home safely. God saved the boy through her.</p><p>Lin Kwang-biao, Tu Tsoung-chen, Wu Si-you<br />April 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sisters Wang, Lee, and Chang in the Lord:</p><p>Praise and thank God our heavenly Father for separating us from the worldly people through His rich love and mercy. Through The Open Door we have read how all the brothers and sisters have richly received God's grace. Our hearts are full of praise to the Lord. Since our hospital moved to Feng-Lin-Chiao, we have not had many patients because we are too remote, and transportation is inconvenient. We have moved our outpatient clinic to Fu-Hsuin Road and Ch'eng-tu Road. Many people lost their jobs, but the sisters are still here. Sister Lin Meng-bin returned to Foochow, and Sister Zhang Ju-sian went to the Red Cross Hospital. We still do not know where Sister Di Teh-jia is. Sister Wang Mei-lin's elderly mother came to Shanghai from the countryside of Tai-Chang. Her elderly father is more than eighty. His arthritis is so bad that he cannot move, so he is still in the country. May the Lord who bears our burdens enable us to sing new songs to Jehovah in difficult environments. Shi-kwai's mother was released from the hospital on March 20. This was a miracle! He heard our prayers. Thank Him! She is well now, and she is the same as a normal person. Glory to God! Shi-kwai's father met God this time. Sister Chen Shiu-yu and Sister Yeh are both well. The Lord has increased the number of saved ones with Sister Tseng Ji-ai and Sister Chang Ju-hua. There is also a Miss Chu. They all have a heart to pursue the Lord. Please pray for us. We do not hope to do a great work for the Lord, but we do hope that we do not shame the Lord's name. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>All the sisters<br />in the Shanghai Women's and Children's Hospital<br />April 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Thank God for His grace in enabling me to write this letter. Thank you for praying for my illness. When my illness was at its worst, people did not believe that there was any hope. Even I had lost hope in myself. However, God gave me a word through Sister Tso&mdash;Psalm 118:17. This word caught hold of me. I am physically stronger than I was before. I have been back at work at the hospital for almost two months. God showed me that I should live completely for Him when I got encephalitis in Hangchow. This time God gave me the word in Psalm 118:17. Although I have already placed my all into God's hands, my flesh is lazy, so I often live in a state of confusion. May God edify me more.</p><p>The smallest in the Lord,<br />Li Li-ying<br />April 11<br />[Address omitted]</p>
