[1]  Message One The Constitution of the New Covenant Ministry Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6; 4:1; 1:3-22 The ministry is based upon God s covenants the old covenant and the new covenant 3:6: A ministry is to carry out what God has covenanted with His people; without God s covenant, it is impossible to have any ministry, and whatever we do cannot be considered a ministry.
[2]  Message Two How the Ministers of the New Covenant
[3]  and How Their Ministry Is Carried Out 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:16, 18 4:1, 6-7 The ministers of the new covenant are mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image 2 Cor 3:16, 18 4:1: Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away from our heart, and we can behold the Lord of glory with an unveiled face 3:16, 18.
[4]  the Spirit of a New Covenant Minister Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:1-6; 2:13; 6:6; 12:18 The function of the new covenant ministry is to write living letters of Christ with the life-giving Spirit 2 Cor 3:1-6: The believers became the apostles letters of commendation, written by the apostles with Christ as the content in every part of their being vv.
[5]  The heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches; to have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ 2 Cor 3:3; Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:8, 16-17a.
[6]  The only One qualified to do the work of writing living letters of Christ is God 2 Cor 3:5-6: The living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the apostles ministry for God s New Testament economy to dispense Christ into God s chosen people for the building up of the Body v. 5.
[7]  Message Six The Constitution of the New Covenant Ministers Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:12-18 The ministers of the new covenant are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit 2 Cor 3:12-18: The new covenant ministers are persons whose hearts have turned to the Lord, whose faces are unveiled, who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit, freeing them from the bondage of the law, and who are being transformed into the image of the Lord by beholding and reflecting Him vv.
[8]  Message Eight A New Creation in Christ Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:17; 4:16; Gal 6:15 As believers in Christ, we have been made a new creation 2 Cor 5:17: The most crucial matter in God s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation in Christ Gal 6:15.
[9]  We are a new creation through our organic union with Christ v. 17: To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and nature; this is of God through our faith in Christ 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:26-28.
[10]  and the Ministry of Reconciliation Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:16 6:2, 11-13 The ministers of the new covenant are ambassadors of Christ 2 Cor 5:20a; Eph 6:20: An ambassador of Christ is one who represents God, the highest authority in the universe: God has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Christ Matt 28:18.
[11]  Message Ten Working Together with God by an All-fitting Life
[12]  with the Intimate Concern of the Ministering Life Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:1-13; 7:2-3 Every believer who loves the Lord and who wants to come up to God s standard should become a minister of the new covenant Eph 4:11-12; 1 Tim 1:16: The goal of the Lord s recovery is to recover the ministering of Christ by all the believers so that the church as the Body of Christ may be built up.
[13]  We need to work together with God by a life not by any gift that is all-sufficient and all-mature, able to fit all situations, able to endure any kind of treatment, to accept any kind of environment, to work in any kind of condition, and to take any kind of opportunity, for the carrying out of our ministry John 14:6a; Acts 27:22-25; 28:3-6, 8-9: To work together with God means that we are in God; only a person who is in God can bring others into God; our closeness to God is the measure of the result of our work 2 Cor 5:20; 2:10.
[14]  Message Eleven Apostolic Authority Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:1, 24; 10:8; 12:12, 15; 13:4, 10 Apostolic authority, in contrast to people s consideration in their natural concept, is not for ruling over the believers but for building them up 2 Cor 10:8; 13:10; 1:24; cf.
[15]  Our understanding of the word apostle must be biblical, that is, according to the pure Word of God, not according to religious tradition 2 Cor 1:1: The Greek word for apostle means one who is sent : An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches Acts 13:1-4; 14:4, 14-15.
[16]  When Paul refers to himself as an apostle 2 Cor 1:1; 12:12 , he means one sent by God to minister Christ into sinners so that they may become sons of God and members of Christ and then be edified to grow and become the Body of Christ Rom 1:1; 8:14; 12:4-5: Paul did not use this word with the connotation that an apostle is a powerful person authorized by Christ to control and overrule 2 Cor 10:8; 13:10 ; such a concept is despicable.
[17]  of the Grace of God in His Economy Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; 1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9 Grace is the Divine Trinity transmitted into us for our enjoyment, the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects the Father, the Son, and the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14; Num 6:22-27; Psa 36:8-9: The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment John 1:17; 1 Cor 15:10 , the love of God is God Himself 1 John 4:8, 16 as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation 2 Cor 13:14.
