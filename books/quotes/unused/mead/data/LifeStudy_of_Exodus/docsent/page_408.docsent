   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 9 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:15-21; 39:8-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the breastplate was of the same workmanship and material as the ephod and that it was squared and doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The breastplate signifies that the church is of the same formation and constituent as Christ and that it is a perfect testimony held in Christ s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we shall go on to consider the twelve stones on the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ONE ENTITY COMPOSED OF TWELVE STONES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 21 says, And the stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, each according to his name they shall be, for the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The names of the twelve tribes of Israel engraved on the twelve stones signify all the redeemed people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These twelve stones do not signify God s redeemed people in a separate or individualistic way, but in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The stones are separate pieces, but they are not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, they are incorporated, put together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Using a New Testament term, the stones have been built together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The twelve stones have been built together to become one entity, and the name of that entity is the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord bears us in a corporate way, even in an incorporated way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus has built us together; He has incorporated us into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The breastplate was one entity composed of twelve separate, individual stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the believers are distinct individuals, but they are not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are separate pieces, but we are not separated, individualistic pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, today s Christians have been separated and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to their understanding, the Lord bears each one individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this is the situation, then the Lord s bearing of one believer does not have anything to do with His bearing of another believer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Lord does not bear us individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, He bears one entity, the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have received light from the Lord, we shall mourn over the situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We shall grieve over the divisions among God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be sure, there were twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Each tribe was represented by a stone on the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But all these stones were built together into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the breastplate was actually a building of precious stones set in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gold was the element which enabled the twelve stones to become one building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SIGNIFYING TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The twelve stones on the breastplate were precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These precious stones signify transformation of the human nature by and with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How do we know that they signify transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know it by the fact that they were precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Precious stones are not something originally created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, they are formed into precious stones by a process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through this process clay or some other material is transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An illustration of the process of transformation can be found in the way wood is changed into petrified wood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Over a period of time, water saturates the wood, carrying away its natural element and replacing it with another kind of element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, the wood is transformed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christian living involves a daily process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible says that man was created from the dust of the ground: And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day the heavenly flow with the divine mineral entered into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This divine mineral is the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 , and the water is the divine life, the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once this living water came into us, it began to wash away our natural life and to add more of the divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Day by day we are living a life of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are all undergoing God s transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Lord s recovery we have paid a great deal of attention to the matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, not much has been written by others on the importance of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, it is a fact that all believers eventually will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the process of transformation cannot be completed in this age, God will have a way to complete it in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the New Jerusalem all the believers will be transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Babel was built with bricks, but there will be no bricks in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This city will be built with transformed material; that is, it will be constituted of God s redeemed, transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What Christians, then, will share in the millennium?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It will be those who have been transformed during their lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in eternity in the New Jerusalem all the people of God will be there as transformed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Christian life is a life of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Daily God is seeking to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This transformation is a transformation of the human nature by and with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that a better material is being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result, although we were made of dust, we are being transformed into something precious and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This comes from being saturated with better materials, with heavenly materials.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I can testify that I still need more transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I know that I am certainly not perfect and that the process of transformation has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, I can testify that I am very different from what I was many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I was a young Christian, I was a man of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But over the years I have experienced much of the Spirit s transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, I can testify truly that I am more transformed today than I was years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many believers can give such a testimony, for we all are living a life of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The twelve stones were set in golden mountings vv.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This signifies that the believers are kept in Christ s divine nature.</S>
