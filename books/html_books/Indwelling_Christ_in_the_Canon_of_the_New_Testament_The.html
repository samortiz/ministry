<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>These messages on the indwelling Christ were given by Brother Witness Lee during an informal training in Los Angeles, California in 1974. They were originally published in <em>The Stream,</em> volumes 12 and 13, in the winter of 1974-1975.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SEVEN STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 1:23; 28:19-20; John 1:1, 14; 14:16-20; 15:4a, 5a; Rom. 8:9-10a; 2 Cor. 13:5</h1>
<p>I have a deep sense that many of us need to see something deeper in our spirit. We need to see something inward, not outward, something deep, and not so shallow and superficial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEEPEST RELATION OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>The greatest revelation that the Bible conveys to us is the relation of God and man. The Scriptures not only tell us who God is and what kind of God He is, but also who man is and from what source he came. Moreover, the Scriptures even depict in detail a full record of God&rsquo;s relation with man. This is the central revelation of the whole Bible.</p>
<p>When I mention this, I know that many Christians will think that the main relation between God and man is that of the Creator with His creatures. Others would say that God is our Father, and we are His children. Still others would mention that God is our Lord and Master, and we are His servants. Of course, we do have all of these relationships revealed in the Bible, but we must realize that these aspects are not the deepest revelation of God&rsquo;s relation with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMAGE FOR EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>What then is the deepest relation of God with man? In the Bible, the first time man is mentioned, it is said that God created man in His own image. In other words, man was created according to God. We all must be deeply impressed with this one aspect: mankind was created according to God. The New Testament tells us that eventually we will all be made the same as God. Firstly, we were created in the image of God, and eventually we will be made the same as God. An image is the expression of a person. By this we can realize that God&rsquo;s intention is to have man to express Him. Man was made to express God. God created man in His own image, because God&rsquo;s intention was to have man as His expression.</p>
<p>We all know that to express God is not a shallow or superficial matter. In order to express God, there is the need for God to get into us. God must come into us to be our very life and content; then we will be His outward expression. By this we see that if God would express Himself through man, He must be one with man. And to be one with man, God must be wrought into man. The only way for God to express Himself through us is for Him to work Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>This is why the first chapter in the Bible tells us that God created man in His own image. Then the second chapter of the Bible tells us that God put man in front of the tree of life. In the first chapter, man had the image of God outwardly, but he did not have the life of God within him. Man was made outwardly in God&rsquo;s image, but inwardly he did not have God&rsquo;s life. Hence, in the second chapter, God put man in front of the tree of life. It was God&rsquo;s intention that man would take this life into him. Then God would get into man and be one with man. God would become man&rsquo;s content, and man would become God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>For example, I am wearing a jacket which was made according to the form of my body. It was not made with only one sleeve; otherwise it would not fit my body. It was made with two sleeves, in just the right way, so that it would perfectly fit. When I put the jacket on, it becomes my expression, and I become the content of the jacket. If I never put the jacket on, although it may be an excellent piece of material, it is meaningless. In other words, if I do not become the content of this jacket, it is useless. It is only when I put on the jacket that it fulfills its meaning. We were made the expression of God. One day God in Christ came into us to be our life and content, making us meaningful. This means that Christ has come into us to become our inward being. Now we all have Christ in us as our inward being.</p>
<p>Before I was saved, I was a certain kind of being, but now I have full assurance to say that I have another wonderful Being in me! I also believe that while I am speaking, this wonderful Being is speaking in my speaking. When I speak, He speaks. This wonderful Being is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Very few Christians realize that the deepest relation that God has with us is that He enters into us and even becomes us that we may have Him as our very being. Then we become His expression. He is our being and our content, and we are His expression. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful?</p><h2 class="head1">NO MORE INDIVIDUALS</h2>
<p>One thing we must realize is that when God gets into us, we eventually become no more individualistic. It is just like the electric light fixtures. Before the electricity flows into them, they are all individualistic. But once the electricity comes, all the light fixtures become one with the electricity, and the electricity becomes their unity. All the fixtures are brought into a kind of unity.</p>
<p>In the same way, Christians should not be individual units. We should have something of unity. Our unity is the very God who is our content within. When God is our content, we are not just so many different individuals. Outwardly speaking we are, but inwardly speaking we are one unity. Suppose there are thirty light fixtures on the ceiling with the electric current flowing through them. Outwardly, they are many individual lights, but inwardly there is only one electricity, through which they become one unity. They all have one content, and that content is their unity. Hallelujah! We are many Christians, but we all have one content; so we all have the same unity. God Himself within us is our content. This is the deepest relation that God has with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CORPORATE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2>
<p>The outcome of this is that God has a corporate expression, for He has become one with many people. This is the relation the Bible reveals between God and man. There are many other items in the Bible, but they are not so deep. God is not only our Creator, our Father, our Lord, and so many other things. The deepest aspect of God&rsquo;s relation with us is that He comes into us to be our content in order that we might become His expression. In other words, He becomes our content that He may become us, and we may become one with Him. This is a great, universal undertaking. It is a heavenly, divine, eternal, and holy project. God is working Himself into us to be one with us that He might be our content, and that we might be His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INCARNATION</h2>
<p>To accomplish this universal, divine project, God has to take seven steps. We are only going to cover one of these during these messages, but we need to look at all seven. The first step is incarnation. I do not mention the matter of creation, because that is too objective. The first main step that God took to accomplish His divine project is incarnation. Incarnation far transcends creation. In creation, God merely made so many things&mdash;the heavens, the earth, and man. That was indeed marvelous, but that was not so wonderful as the incarnation. In creation, God never came into the creature. The incarnation, however, is the mingling of God with man. God took the first step to become incarnated by coming into man and being one with man. Incarnation means that God becomes one with man. We all know from the Gospels that Jesus was born in Bethlehem in a manger. He was just a little child born of a virgin, called Jesus. But this little child is called Emmanuel, God with us. He who was named Jesus was God, God with man. Do you believe this? Many Jewish people today do not believe it. They even have the Old Testament which says in Isaiah 7:14, &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel,&rdquo; yet they do not believe that the child born in a manger at Bethlehem was Emmanuel, God with us. Matthew 1:23 says the same thing: &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.&rdquo; In that manger was a little child who was the mingling of God with man. God and man were made one. Though He was a child, yet His name was called Emmanuel, God with us. This corresponds with Isaiah 9:6, which says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born...his name is called The Mighty God.&rdquo; He was God, but He was not merely God; He was God with us.</p>
<p>Before incarnation, God was so great. He was in the heavens, and He was so free. But by incarnation, He became very limited. He was limited in a manger. He had to escape from the land of Canaan to Egypt, and come back from Egypt to the Holy Land. Then He went to the North, to a little city called Nazareth. Eventually, He became a Nazarene, a little man in the city of Nazareth. But we must realize that this was God with man. The incarnation was the mingling of God with man. He was the Word become flesh. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14a). This was the first step.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIFIXION</h2>
<p>The second step in God&rsquo;s project was the crucifixion. After He lived as Emmanuel on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He was crucified on the cross. What is the meaning of crucifixion? Most people would say that He was crucified on the cross for our sins. This is true, but we must realize that crucifixion not only means the taking away of sins, but also the termination of everything! Incarnation means mingling, and crucifixion means termination. When He was crucified on the cross, all the negative things were terminated. Even we were terminated there! Do you know when and where you were terminated? Praise the Lord! We were all terminated on the cross with Christ. When He was crucified, we were terminated. All the negative things were terminated on the cross. If you have a bad temper, don&rsquo;t be bothered by that. Tell all the demons that your temper was terminated on the cross. The world was terminated there. Sin was terminated there. The devil with all his fallen angels and demons were terminated there. Our flesh, our self, our fallen nature, our soul, our old man, our everything was terminated there. Our husband, our wife, our children, our brother, our sister were all terminated. Everything of the old creation was terminated on the cross! Crucifixion means termination, and termination means the end. This is the second step.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>But praise the Lord! He has taken a third step. Following crucifixion, there is resurrection. Hallelujah! Christ was crucified and buried, but He rose from the dead. Around Him there was nothing but death, but death could not hold Him. He was not captured by death. He took a tour to see death, to visit it for a while, but He walked out of death! He walked in, and He walked out. That was resurrection, and resurrection means germination. First we were terminated, then we were germinated. Termination ends the old creation, and germination starts the new creation. Many of us love our wife; but if we would let our wife be terminated on the cross, she would be germinated. Then we would have a new wife in the new creation. The same is true regarding the sisters. I am sure that all the sisters would rather have their husband in the new creation than in the old creation. They are terminated, and then they are germinated with a new life. Crucifixion means termination, and resurrection means germination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ASCENSION</h2>
<p>The fourth step is ascension. Ascension means inauguration. Whenever a new president of this country is elected, there is the need of an inauguration. Before the inauguration he is the president-elect, but by his inauguration he becomes the official president. The same is true of the ascension of Jesus. By ascending to the heavens, He was inaugurated into His post as Lord of all (Acts 2:36). God Himself has always been Lord of all, but by the ascension of Jesus, a man became the Lord of all! Do you realize that the little Nazarene, Jesus, is now Lord of all? He was not simply put into the lead, but He was inaugurated into the lead. At the time of His ascension, God prepared the whole universe for Jesus of Nazareth to become Lord of all. He is also the Christ, as well as the King of kings. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). He is the Head of all things (Eph. 1:22). Hallelujah! What an inauguration He had! When the president of this country is inaugurated, thousands of people parade through Washington D. C. I do not know how many angels were parading when Jesus of Nazareth was inaugurated in the presence of God to be the Lord of all. He was made the Lord of lords and the Head of all things. This is the meaning of the fourth step, the ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Then, after His inauguration, He descended to baptize His Body. This is the fifth step. On the day of Pentecost He collected together all the Jewish members of His Body and put them into Himself who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Later, in the house of Cornelius, He collected all the Gentile members of His Body and put them into Himself. By this step of baptism, He baptized both Jews and Gentiles into one Body.</p>
<p>When were you baptized by the Spirit into the Body? If you are a Jew, you were baptized at Pentecost. If you are a Gentile, you were baptized at the house of Cornelius. Even before we were born, we were all baptized into one Body. We were all terminated on the cross before we were born, and we were all baptized into one Body before we were born. The Lord Jesus Christ accomplished one crucifixion, one resurrection, and one baptism. This is why 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free: and were all made to drink of one Spirit.&rdquo; Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have all been baptized already.</p>
<p>We were chosen before the foundation of the world, and at Christ&rsquo;s ascension, God gave all of us to Christ. In fact, at the ascension, God gave Christ four main things: His people, His life, His Spirit, and all the functions of the Spirit. Then on the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius Christ put all of God&rsquo;s chosen people into Himself to make them His members. This was all accomplished once and for all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDWELLING</h2>
<p>After this, we have the indwelling, which is the sixth step. After He put us all into Himself, then He came into us to indwell us. All the other steps which we have mentioned&mdash; incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension and baptism&mdash; were accomplished once and for all. But the indwelling is not like that. It is not once and for all. From the day that Christ came into us and began to indwell us, there are many things that must be done. This is why we need at least 20 messages to cover this matter of the indwelling of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADVENT</h2>
<p>After the indwelling, there will be the second coming of Christ. This is the advent, which is also once and for all. So altogether we can see seven steps: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, baptism, indwelling, and the advent. Incarnation means mingling, crucifixion means termination, resurrection means germination, ascension means inauguration, baptism means being put into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19, &ldquo;in&rdquo; in Greek is &ldquo;into&rdquo;), indwelling means transformation, and advent means transfiguration. When the Lord comes back, He will transfigure our outward body like unto His glorious body (Phil. 3:21). At this time, from within and without, we will all be absolutely the same as He is (1 John 3:2), we will be fully one with Him. Hallelujah! These are the seven steps which God has taken to accomplish His purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOD-REDEEMER-<br />
LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:3-4, 22, 36-38, 44-45, 50-54; 2 Cor. 3:6b, 17-18</h1>
<p>We have seen the seven steps that God has taken in Christ to fulfill His purpose. The most mysterious step is the sixth, the indwelling. It is the most strategic step in accomplishing God&rsquo;s project. God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into us that we may have Him as our life, our person, and our content. Then, as His Body, we will be His expression.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, God first of all became incarnated. He mingled Himself with man. Then, as a man in the flesh, He was put on the cross. Satan&rsquo;s thought was to put Him to death, but Satan did not realize that by the cross all the negative things in the universe were terminated. Sin, self, the old man, the soulish life, the human fallen nature, the world, Satan, the demons, and all negative things were ended on the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>After the Lord was crucified and buried, He rested on the Sabbath day (John 19:31). He had finished everything on the cross and declared, &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; (John 19:30). Then He rested in the grave to keep the Sabbath. But on the first day of the next week (John 20:1) He arose from the dead. That was a new beginning. His death was a termination to the old creation, and His resurrection was the germination to the new creation. Then, by His ascension, He was inaugurated into His position of Lord of all. He was fully authorized to be the Savior (Acts 5:31), the King of kings, the Lord of lords, and the Head over all things. He was officially put into such a position.</p>
<p>After ten days, He descended as the Spirit to put all of God&rsquo;s chosen people into Himself. This was the baptism. It was accomplished once and for all on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) for the Jews and at the house of Cornelius (Acts 10) for the Gentiles. We were all baptized then and made members of His Body (1 Cor. 12:13).</p>
<p>Now the Lord dwells in us. He has to indwell us in order to transform us. However, transformation is not a once for all matter. This is something that takes a life time. Every day the indwelling Christ is transforming us. His indwelling means His transforming. The purpose of the indwelling is to work Christ into our whole being. We need many messages to develop all the things related to the matter of the indwelling.</p>
<p>After His transforming work, the Lord will come back, and that will be the advent. At that time He will transfigure our body. We have a spirit, a soul, and a body. Our spirit is the organ by which we contact and receive God. Our soul is our very being, and our bodies are formed to contain our being. When we believe in the Lord, He comes into our spirit to regenerate our spirit. By this He starts His indwelling within our spirit. Then by His indwelling He spreads from our spirit to transform our being, which is our soul. This is the working of Christ into our being in order to transform every part of our soul (Rom. 12:2). Then the Lord will return to transfigure our body into His glorious form (Phil. 3:21). At that time all three parts of our entire being will be exactly the same as He is (1 John 3:2). Then we will express Him in a corporate way for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MISSING OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Most Christians know something of the incarnation of Christ. They also know something of the death, resurrection, ascension, and second coming of Christ. Many are confused about the baptism of Christ, but we cannot go into this matter at this time. We would suggest that you obtain a copy of the booklet, <em>The Baptism in the Holy Spirit</em> from the Living Stream Ministry. Some Christians are clear about this matter. But very, very few Christians know something in an experiential way of the indwelling of Christ. The indwelling of Christ is the inner life. Even some so-called deeper life Christians have never realized much of the indwelling of Christ. But if we do not realize and experience the indwelling of Christ, there is no way to enter into the deeper life. The deeper life is not speaking in tongues or some kind of manifestation of the gifts. It should be the indwelling of Christ. Christ comes into our spirit, and by His indwelling He is working every day to saturate every part of our being with Himself. This is the deeper life, and this is the inner life. It is indeed sad that today the most strategic matters of Christian experience are fully missed by most Christians.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>When Christ came, He was the very embodiment of God. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). Christ is God. Some so-called Christians today do not confess that He is God. But anyone who does not confess that Christ is God is not our brother. All real Christians must confess this. Without Christ and outside of Christ we simply cannot find God. &ldquo;In Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (Col. 2:9). God is in Christ, and Christ is the manifestation of God (1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD MADE FLESH</h2>
<p>Christ was God in the beginning, but He was made something else. &ldquo;The Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14). God was made flesh. Spiritually speaking, the term <em>flesh</em> is not positive. God did not create flesh; God created a man. Man in the beginning was not flesh. It is not until Genesis 6 that we read that man became flesh (v. 3). This was something that resulted from the fall. Man was man, but due to the fall he gradually became rotten and corrupted. This condition of man is called by the Bible, flesh. So we see that the flesh is not glorious. It is a term denoting fallen and corrupted man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN FORM, NOT IN NATURE</h2>
<p>In John 3:14 we are told that the brass serpent lifted up on a pole was a type of Christ. When the people of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, they rebelled against God. Therefore they were poisoned by serpents, and many were dying. When Moses prayed for them, God told him to raise up a brass serpent, and whoever looked at the brass serpent would be healed (Num. 21:4-9). The brass serpent was only a serpent in form, not in nature. It did not have the poison of the serpent, but only the form. This was a type of Christ. He was lifted up on the cross just like the brass serpent. In the eyes of God, Christ was a serpent on the cross, but only in form. He did not have the serpent nature. Thus, Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh. &ldquo;For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; He was made only in the likeness of the flesh. He had only the form, not the poison. In our flesh there is the poison of the serpent, but in His flesh there is no poison.</p>
<p>Christ was made flesh in form because at the time of His incarnation man was fallen and corrupted. Man had become flesh; so He also became flesh (Heb. 2:14), but only in form. If He had not become flesh, He could never have been a man. Then He could not have been the Lamb of God to shed His blood for the sins of the world (John 1:29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN FLESH</h2>
<p>So we see that the very God was made flesh. Hallelujah! God was made flesh, and His name was called Jesus. Jesus was God in the flesh. He lived on the earth some thirty-three years, and eventually He went to the cross in the flesh to take away all sins and to terminate every negative thing. He did a wonderful job in the flesh. Ephesians 2:15 tells us that in His flesh He even abolished all ordinances. &ldquo;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All things were terminated by Him in the flesh. We should not do anything in the flesh today, but He did many things in the flesh. He bore our sins in the flesh. He died for you and me in the flesh. He terminated all negative things in the flesh. He abolished all the ordinances in the flesh. In flesh, He destroyed the devil who has the power of death (Heb. 2:14). God was made flesh to accomplish all of these things.</p>
<p>God created everything, but Satan sought to poison God&rsquo;s creatures, especially man. And he did it by injecting himself into man. He thought that he had poisoned man, but he did not know that he was trapped. After Satan came into man and made man the flesh, God came into this flesh and used it as an instrument to destroy Satan (Heb. 2:14). He put this flesh upon Himself and went to the cross to crucify this flesh. By doing this, God terminated all the old creation. He terminated Satan, you and me, and every negative thing. He did this in the flesh.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REAL REST</h2>
<p>After He was crucified, the Lord was laid in a sepulcher. That day was a real Sabbath day. He rested because His work was finished. The Jews had argued with Him about the keeping of the Sabbath. They were critical of Him because He did not keep the Sabbath according to their regulations. But He told them that He worked because the Father was working (John 5:16-17). At that time the work had not yet been accomplished. However, when He was on the cross, He said, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; He finished the work that the Father had sent Him to do. So when they put Him into the tomb, He could really rest. The work was done. That was the real keeping of the Sabbath. Of course, that was also a kind of death. But death cannot hold the resurrection life (Acts 2:24). The life rose up from the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The resurrection is quite a strange and mysterious matter. There are many among the so-called modernistic Christians who argue against it. But Paul makes it all very clear in 1 Corinthians 15: &ldquo;But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body&rdquo; (vv. 35-38).</p>
<p>To Paul, anyone that argues against the resurrection is a fool. To all the scientists, the scholars, the modernistic theologians, Paul would say, &ldquo;Thou fool.&rdquo; Just look around you. Every day resurrection is before you. One little tomato seed demonstrates resurrection. It is so yellow and dry; it seems to be nothing. But when you sow that seed into the earth, it dies. That, however, is not the end. Life breaks through, and eventually there are many colorful and tasteful tomatoes. With the seed, there was no juice, no tomatoes. But by sowing the seed into the earth we get a lot of juice and tomatoes. This is resurrection. How could anyone argue against the fact that by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection He became something more. Look at the tomato seed. If you sow it, it dies, and then it grows. And it grows into something more. But still it is the tomato. The tomato seed had no form, taste, or beauty. But in resurrection, the form, the taste, and the beauty all come forth.</p>
<p>Jesus was a little man. He was that little seed sown into the earth. He died there, but He rose up in another form. He still had a body, but now this body is spiritual (1 Cor. 15:44). It is just as a tomato seed, which has a body before it is sown into the ground. But when it grows up, it changes into another body, and there is a big difference. When Jesus died on the cross and was buried, He had a body. But when He was resurrected, His body was much different. Today Jesus is no more like the seed of the tomato. He is like the tomato&mdash;so colorful, tasteful, delicious, and full of nourishment. Hallelujah! This is resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord that today Jesus is no more simply a seed. As the seed on earth, He was sown into death (John 12:24). Then through death, He grew up into something more; He became the life-giving Spirit. This is why Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 15:44-45, &ldquo;It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; By resurrection Christ was made the life-giving Spirit. So now He &ldquo;is the Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>In the beginning, Christ was God. Then He was made flesh as a seed to be sown into death. Then by resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. We all need to see this point. In today&rsquo;s Christianity, not many do see that Christ was made the life-giving Spirit. Christ as the embodiment of God was firstly made flesh, and secondly He was made the life-giving Spirit. In the beginning He was God. But as God He became flesh in order to accomplish redemption for us. Then He became the life-giving Spirit in order to impart life into us and indwell us. He was made flesh for our redemption. He became the life-giving Spirit to be our life.</p>
<p>By our natural birth in Adam, we had nothing but sin, and instead of life, we had death. But praise the Lord! Christ was made flesh to take away our sin. Then He was made the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into us. Now we can realize that our Christ is not only God who became flesh, but also flesh who became the life-giving Spirit. He was God, He became flesh, and as flesh He became the life-giving Spirit. When He was God, He was our Creator. When He became flesh, He became our Redeemer. And now, having become the life-giving Spirit, He is our life and our content.</p>
<p>We all must be very clear that Christ is now the life-giving Spirit. We do have some strong verses to confirm this point. First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam was made the life-giving Spirit. From the previous verses in this chapter we can realize that this was brought about through His death and resurrection. We have considered the seed sown into the earth and growing up in another form as a picture showing us how Christ was in the flesh and how by death and resurrection He became something more. This something more today is the life-giving Spirit. Hallelujah! This is why Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:6, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&rdquo; He continues in verse 17 by saying, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit,&rdquo; the life-giving Spirit. It is the Spirit that gives life, and now the Lord is that Spirit. It is by this life-giving Spirit that we are daily being transformed into His image from glory to glory. &ldquo;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18, Gk.).</p>
<p>Therefore, we must all realize that today our Christ is the God-Redeemer-Life-giving Spirit Christ. The Jewish people have God in a sense, but they do not have Christ. So many Christians have the God-Redeemer Christ, but they do not realize the God-Redeemer-Life-giving Spirit Christ. But praise the Lord that we have such a Christ today! Our Christ became flesh to become our Redeemer, and then He was made the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into us. This is the Christ that we have today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEW TERMS FOR NEW DISCOVERIES</h2>
<p>I realize that I am using some new terms. When we have seen some new things we need some new terms. When something new is discovered in science, new terms are needed to describe it. The dictionaries are continually growing with words. The English dictionary today has many more words than it did one hundred years ago. This is because there have been many more discoveries. It is the same with the spiritual things. There are many things which have never been discovered, but gradually, in these past years, the Lord has been unveiling some of them to us. For these new discoveries we need some new terms.</p>
<p>Do you think that God was God, and that Christ in the flesh was merely Christ in the flesh? And do you think that the life-giving Spirit is someone else, so that there are three separate ones? Do you believe that God was God in the heavens, and that the Redeemer is someone else by the name of Jesus who came in the flesh to die on the cross for our sins? And do you believe that there is a third, separate from the other two, who is the Holy Spirit? I can tell you that by my experience I gradually discovered that God became flesh to become my Redeemer on the cross, and my Redeemer on the cross is just the life-giving Spirit within me. This is not something that I was taught in a doctrinal way. This is something that I came to realize by my experience of the indwelling Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCE VERSUS DOCTRINE</h2>
<p>For some time I simply did not know to whom I should address my prayer. Should I pray to the Father, to Christ, or to the Holy Spirit? I was taught by the Brethren that we should address our prayer only to the Father or to the Lord, never to the Spirit. I was convinced by them, but the more I prayed and the more I experienced the Lord within me, the more I could not tell who was who. At one time I thought I was quite clever and I would pray, &ldquo;My Father, my Lord, my Holy Spirit.&rdquo; But after I did this for awhile, I felt that was really not so clever. It simply did not go along with my experience.</p>
<p>I realize that many of us have the teaching of the Trinity, and I am not arguing against that teaching. But let me say a word. We should never be bothered by our teaching. Teaching is always in the mind, but we must learn to care for the experience of the indwelling Christ in our spirit. Many times we think one thing in our mind, but our experience in our spirit is something else. We should not stay in our mind. We must be in our spirit. Whatever is in the mind is not so true or so real. And it is very hard to relate to something in the mind. But we can relate to something that is real in our spirit. If we are going to experience the indwelling Christ, we must realize that Christ today is the very God who became our Redeemer, and is now the life-giving Spirit who is indwelling us. Hallelujah! This is our Christ. Our Christ is a God-Redeemer-Life-giving Spirit Christ. He is our Lord, and He is indwelling us in order to take over our whole being.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BAPTISM AND THE INDWELLING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 3:11a; 28:19-20b; Rom. 6:3, 4a; Gal. 3:27-28; 1 Cor. 12:13a</h1>
<p>We have seen that God took two steps in order to work Himself into us to be our life. He became flesh, and He became the life-giving Spirit. Jesus was the last Adam in the flesh, but through death and resurrection He was made the life-giving Spirit. He became flesh for our redemption, and He became the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Christianity stresses very much the part of redemption, but they miss the main goal of life. We have heard many messages about redemption in Christianity, but we have never heard that Jesus as the last Adam was made the life-giving Spirit in order to impart Himself into us as life. We had sin, but we did not have life. So Jesus was made flesh to take away our sin, and He became the life-giving Spirit to impart to us His life.</p>
<p>Altogether, the Lord took seven steps in seven stages. There was the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the ascension, the baptism, the indwelling, and the advent. The incarnation means the mingling of God with man. The crucifixion means the termination of all the old creation. The resurrection means the germination of new life with a new start in the new creation. The ascension means that Jesus as a man was inaugurated into the new position of King of kings and Lord of lords to be the Head over all things. Then on the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius, He came as the Baptizer to put all His people into Himself. Following this, He began to indwell all His members for transformation. By His transformation we will be made mature and He will come back. The advent will mean the transfiguration of our physical body. Then we all will be fully, wholly, and thoroughly the same as He is, both inwardly and outwardly. Hallelujah! This will be the New Jerusalem, which is a consummate expression of all that God has been working out in these seven steps.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTO HIM, INTO US</h2>
<p>In this message we must see something more concerning the relationship between the indwelling and the baptism. These stages are closely related to one another. The baptism was to put us into Him, and the indwelling is to put Him into us. Baptism means that we are in Christ, and the indwelling means that Christ is in us. Many times in the New Testament we have these two phrases, &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ in us.&rdquo; We were baptized into Christ, and then Christ came into us.</p>
<p>Of the four Gospels, the first is Matthew and the last is John. This is quite meaningful. Why was the Gospel of John not first, and why was Matthew not last? This would be like putting the head under the feet, and the feet on the neck. It wouldn&rsquo;t fit. To have Matthew first and John last is really fitting. But many Christians have not seen the preciousness of these two books.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>No other books in the Bible reveal as much of the Triune God as these two books. The name of the Triune God is clearly revealed in Matthew. There is not one verse in the Old Testament that tells us so clearly about the Trinity as Matthew 28:19. Of course Genesis and Isaiah give us some hint, because they both use the pronoun &ldquo;us&rdquo; for God. But Matthew twenty-eight makes it so clear and definite: &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, we should realize that this clear word did not come until the Lord Jesus was resurrected. This is in the very last part of the last chapter of the book. Chapter one tells us that Jesus was born of a virgin, and His name was called Emmanuel, God with us. He was just a little, despised man, but He was God with us. After living for some thirty-three years, He was crucified, buried, and resurrected. Then He became the life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive realization, reality, and embodiment of the Triune God. He came back to His disciples as such a One, One who includes the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Then He told them, &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>In chapter one we have Emmanuel, but in the last chapter, God with us becomes the Triune God. We could never be baptized into Emmanuel. He was just a little man called Jesus. We could never get into Him. John the Baptist prophesied in Matthew three that He is the One who will baptize us in the Holy Spirit. But where is the Holy Spirit? It was not until His resurrection that He came back in another wonderful form. He was made the life-giving Spirit, and He came back in such a wonderful way. He had a body which you could touch, yet He came through closed doors! Then He told the disciples to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Triune God. When He was in the flesh as a man, He could not put people into Himself. But after He was resurrected, He was made the life-giving Spirit. He was no more simply the man, Jesus. He was now the ultimate, all-inclusive, realization, reality, and embodiment of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>After speaking of putting people into the Triune God, the Lord told His disciples that He would be with them unto the completion of the age. We are baptized into the Triune God, yet Jesus is with us. So who is Jesus? Jesus is just the Triune God. The proper interpretation of this verse has been completely missed by Christianity.</p><h2 class="head1">A SPIRITUAL AND MYSTICAL UNION</h2>
<p>I would like to quote something from Marvin R. Vincent&rsquo;s book entitled, <em>Word Studies of the New Testament.</em> &ldquo;Baptizing them INTO the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. &lsquo;Into&rsquo; denotes union or communion with. Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him. The name is the sum total of the divine being. It is equivalent to His person. His name is of no avail detached from His nature. When one is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in all that he is and in all that he does for man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe we are clear. To baptize people into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit means to put them into the Triune God. According to Mr. Vincent, this is to put them into the sum total of the divine being, and this is a kind of spiritual and mystical union.</p>
<p>Christianity tells us that Jesus was born simply to save sinners. But Matthew does not end that way. Matthew ends with Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, putting all of God&rsquo;s chosen people into Himself. And His presence is with all the baptized ones. Matthew tells us far more than just the saving of Jesus. Matthew ends with Jesus baptizing all of God&rsquo;s people into the Triune God. And He is the ever present one with all those He has put into Himself. This is simply the church life. It is not merely the saving of Jesus. It is being put into Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, that we may enjoy His indwelling presence in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTO THE TRIUNE GOD, INTO CHRIST,<br />
INTO THE ONE BODY</h2>
<p>Matthew 28 speaks of the baptizing into the name of the Triune God. But Romans 6 speaks of being baptized into Christ. &ldquo;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?&rdquo; (Rom. 6:3). And Galatians 3:27 says the same thing: &ldquo;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Then 1 Corinthians 12:13a says that we have been baptized into one Body: &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body.&rdquo; So from these verses we can see that we are baptized into the Triune God, baptized into Christ, and baptized into one Body.</p>
<p>Now we have some trouble. Are these three baptisms, or are they one? If they are one, how could one baptism put us into three categories of beings? We have been put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body. Are we in three, or are we in one? We have been put into one because the Triune God is Christ, and Christ is the one Body. To be baptized into the Triune God is simply to be put into Christ, and to be put into Christ is to be put into His Body. Hallelujah! We have been baptized into the Triune God, we have been baptized into Christ, and both Jews and Gentiles have been baptized into one Body. These are not three categories of separate beings. They are one. The Triune God is simply Christ, and Christ today is His Body. &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:12). Christ in many members is one Body, and in one Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body.</p>
<p>I have the deep conviction that this is all very new to us. But on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, Christ as the baptizing Spirit, embodying the Triune God, put all God&rsquo;s chosen people into the Triune God. To be put into the Triune God simply means to be put into Christ Himself, and to be put into Christ Himself is to be put into the one Body.</p>
<p>Now we know why Matthew mentions the Triune God in such a clear and emphatic way. It is because Matthew shows us how God became incarnated, born of a virgin to be Emmanuel, God with us. But we could not be put into Emmanuel. He had to go through some thirty-three years of process. He was processed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. And the life-giving Spirit is the last Person of the Triune God, being His full embodiment and realization. Now Christ is such a Spirit, into whom we all have been baptized.</p>
<p>Whenever the church baptizes new believers, we must have the faith and realization that Jesus is baptizing with us. For us to baptize others means nothing. But in our baptizing, the Lord Jesus is putting people into the Triune God. That really is something. He is the Baptizer, and as the life-giving Spirit, He embodies the very Triune God, into whom they are baptized. They are baptized into the Triune God, into Himself, and into His one Body.</p><h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO TERMINATION</h2>
<p>By baptism, we have been put into the Triune God, but this putting in also includes the termination. We need to read Romans 6 again. &ldquo;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death&rdquo; (Rom. 6:3-4). We were baptized into His death, and we have seen that His death means termination. So to be baptized into Christ means to be baptized into termination.</p>
<p>When we were baptized into Christ, we were terminated in Him and buried in Him. We are happy to hear that we were baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body, but we must realize what baptism means. Baptism means termination and burial. To be baptized into Christ is to be terminated in Christ. We are even buried in Christ. So many people think that to be put into Christ means to be put into the heavens, but it really means to be put into a tomb. This is why Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;No more I.&rdquo; The &ldquo;I&rdquo; is terminated and buried. As many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into His death. This is not so pleasant. We like to stay in Christ, but we do not like to stay in the tomb. But if we take Christ, surely we must also take His death. And His death means termination and burial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTO THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Nearly all Christians know that Matthew is a book concerning the kingdom. But this book also shows us that to enter into the kingdom is really simple. We only have to be buried into Christ, and then we are in the kingdom. If we would be buried in Christ, we are in the kingdom. To go and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the Triune God means to put people into the kingdom. And to put people into the kingdom means to terminate them and bury them.</p>
<p>Today, the real meaning of baptism has been completely lost. People only know the form as a kind of ritual. They simply cannot understand that baptism means to be put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body. And it means to be terminated and buried in Christ. All my history, my natural life, my self, my nature, and my whole being is now terminated in Christ and is buried. By this I am in the Triune God, I am in Christ, I am in the one Body, and I am in the kingdom. There is no other way but to be buried into Christ. It is not simply to be buried in the water. That means little. We have to be buried into Christ.</p>
<p>We must learn to put these four verses together. Matthew 28:19 says that we have been baptized into the Triune God. Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 say that we have been baptized into Christ. And 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we have been baptized into the one Body. The Triune God is the very Christ, and the very Christ is the one Body. When we are buried into these three things, which are really one, we are really terminated. Then we are in the proper church life, the kingdom, and the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER MEANING OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>If God did not become the life-giving Spirit, it would be really difficult for Him to put people into Himself. In the first place, we would still have sin. Sin would not be dealt with. Besides this, we are mere human beings. How could human beings be put into God? But, praise the Lord that He became flesh to accomplish redemption and take away the sin of man. After this, He became the life-giving Spirit, making it possible for His chosen ones to be baptized into Him. So when we are baptizing others, we should not do it by ourselves. We must do it with Him, by being one with Him. We put them into the water, but He is putting them into Himself. On the one hand, He is the Baptizer, and on the other hand, He is the available Spirit, making it possible for Him to put people into Himself.</p>
<p>If we would know the indwelling of Christ, we must see the proper meaning of the baptism. We have been baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body. And this baptism means our termination and our burial. We have been fully ended. All the Americans are fully ended, and all the Chinese are terminated. All the natural human beings have been terminated and buried. Hallelujah! Now it is no more I, but Christ. &ldquo;I&rdquo; have been terminated and buried into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body. This is the meaning of baptism.</p>
<p>Now we are clear concerning the Gospel of Matthew. Matthew tells us that Christ was a little child, born of a virgin. And this little child was Emmanuel, God with us. After living on this earth He was processed through death and resurrection to become the wonderful life-giving Spirit, who is the full realization, reality, and embodiment of the Triune God. He is the Baptizer, and He is also the very One into whom people are baptized. This is the baptism that forms the one Body, and this Body today is just Christ, and Christ is the Triune God. Praise the Lord!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">DRINKING FOR THE INDWELLING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; 14:10, 17, 20; 1 Cor. 12:13b; Rev. 22:17; Gal. 2:20a</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE START IN MATTHEW</h2>
<p>We have seen something in Matthew, and now we must see something in John. Matthew is the start, and John is the end. We know that in the universe there is such a universal principle. There are always two ends. It is really difficult for anything to exist with only one end. There is the front, and there is the rear. There is the right and the left. There is the inside and the outside. There are males and females. There is heaven and earth. There is day and night. And there is the beginning and the ending.</p>
<p>The four Gospels begin with Matthew and end with John. If we only have Matthew without John, we have the beginning without the ending. And if we have John without Matthew, we have only the ending without the beginning. We have seen that Matthew is not a story book or a book of doctrine. It is a book of Emmanuel, who is the Triune God, into whom we have been baptized. Our God firstly became Emmanuel, God with us. Then eventually He was made the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, into whom we have been baptized. So today we are one Body enjoying the Triune God. This is Matthew. A virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son. His name shall be called Emmanuel. Then at the last of the book we are to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, who is with us until the completion of the age. This is really wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTO US</h2>
<p>However, this is just the start. We have been put into Him, but what about Him being put into us? In Matthew we do not have this. Surely the beginning could not have the ending. With our head, there are no feet. The head is the head, and the feet are the feet. So we must go on to see the ending in the Gospel of John. John does not tell us so much that we are in Him, but that He is in us.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 shows us these two aspects in one verse. &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we are Jews or Gentiles, whether we are bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.&rdquo; To be baptized is to be put into something. But to drink is to get something into us. When we are baptized in water, that means we have been put into the water. But when we drink the water, that means that the water gets into us. In Matthew we all have been baptized into the Triune God. We were all baptized into one Spirit. Now in John, we all have been made to drink of the one Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 28, we are baptized into the Triune God. In John fourteen, the Triune God is also clearly revealed. First of all, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He and the Father were one. &ldquo;Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works&rdquo; (John 14:9-10). This corresponds with Isaiah 9:6, which tells us that the son who is given to us is called the everlasting Father. By these verses we clearly see that the Father and the Son are one.</p>
<p>Then, from verse 17 of John chapter fourteen, the Lord begins to reveal to us that He will become the Spirit of Reality: &ldquo;And I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I am coming to you&rdquo; (John 14:16-18). When the Spirit of reality comes, He will not only be with us, but also in us. This is simply Jesus in us. The Spirit of reality is Jesus. The pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo; in verse 17 becomes &ldquo;I&rdquo; in verse 18. &ldquo;He&rdquo; is &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I&rdquo; is &ldquo;he.&rdquo; He said that He was going to die, but that He was not departing. His going was His coming. After a little while, which was only three days, He came back in the form of the life-giving Spirit. It is just like the flower seed being sown into the earth and growing up as a flower.</p>
 <p>We see that John fourteen speaks of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;just as Matthew twenty-eight. The reason for this is that both of these books tell us that God is going to dispense Himself into us. The so-called Trinity is not a doctrine, it is for dispensing. The purpose of the Trinity is to dispense the Triune God into us. To do this, there was the need of a process. God the Father was in the Son, and the Son became the life-giving Spirit. This is a process in order that God could be dispensed into us.</p>
<p>In both Matthew and John, the principle is the same. Matthew started with a little child being born of a virgin. John started from the beginning. Of course, the beginning in John was a beginning without any beginning. That was eternity past. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...&rdquo; (John 1:1). John started with the eternal God. Matthew started with a child born of a virgin. But both of these books tell us that He was the Triune God, whether He was God in eternity past, or a child born of a virgin. The very God in eternity past was the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Even that little child born of a virgin was also the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is really wonderful! Both are for the purpose of dispensing God into us. In Matthew we are put into Him, and in John He comes into us. We were put into Him, and we were made to drink of Him. So Matthew speaks of the baptism, but John speaks of the drinking.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPECIAL SPIRIT IN JOHN SEVEN</h2>
<p>In John 7:37-39, the Lord speaks about drinking. &ldquo;In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Spirit was not yet; because Jesus was not yet glorified.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spirit in John seven is special, because it says that the Spirit was not yet. The King James Version inserts the word &ldquo;given,&rdquo; but it is not in the original. The original says that at that time the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not glorified. This means that before Jesus was resurrected, there was not such a life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not resurrected yet. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected. It is the same with a little seed when it is sown into the earth. When it is grown up and blossoms, it is glorified. When it is glorified, it becomes something else. It is no more a seed, but a flower.</p>
<p>When Jesus was in John seven, He was still a seed. He had not yet become the life-giving Spirit for us to drink. We all know that when Jesus was speaking in John seven, the Spirit of God was here. We could not say that the Spirit of God was not yet. There <em>was</em> the Spirit of God, but the life-giving Spirit was not yet. This is because Jesus had not gone through death and resurrection. When He was resurrected, He was glorified. Then He became the life-giving Spirit, so available for us to drink. Hallelujah!</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTISM AND DRINKING</h2>
<p>The baptism is in Matthew, and the drinking is in John. For this reason 1 Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we have all been baptized in one Spirit, and we have been made to drink of one Spirit. Then, following chapter twelve, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam was made the life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; So in 1 Corinthians we have these two verses telling us of two spirits. Chapter twelve tells us to drink of one Spirit, and chapter fifteen tells us that the Lord became the life-giving Spirit. These two spirits are certainly one. The life-giving Spirit in chapter fifteen is the one Spirit in chapter twelve. So to drink of one Spirit is to drink of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>It is so important that we see these two aspects of baptism and drinking. We start with baptism, and we continue with drinking. However, baptism is once and for all, but drinking is continuous. We should never stop drinking. By baptism we were put into Christ, and by drinking we get Christ into us. To be put into Christ is once and for all. But to get Christ into every part of our being takes a life time. It is even a matter of eternity. In the New Jerusalem, we will still be drinking of the Spirit. When we get into eternity, baptism will cease, but drinking will continue. We will drink for eternity. It is so clear that the river of life in Revelation twenty-two is not for baptism, but for drinking. &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely&rdquo; (Rev. 22:17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONFUSION OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Nothing in today&rsquo;s Christianity is so confusing as the matter of baptism. There are many who think that the baptism is everything. They want the baptism, but they don&rsquo;t want the drinking. They even speak about 1 Corinthians 12:13, but they never mention the last part of the verse concerning drinking. This is the problem today. The real need is not the baptism, but the drinking.</p>
<p>We must realize that the baptism has been already accomplished. Even before we were born, we were baptized. &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized.&rdquo; Many times people have asked me, &ldquo;Have you been baptized in the Holy Spirit?&rdquo; I tell them that I was baptized in the house of Cornelius before I was born. We all know that our sins were taken away on the cross before we were born. It is the same with the baptism. It is once and for all.</p><h2 class="head1">A PROMISE AND A CALLING</h2>
<p>But drinking is not once for all. We do need to take care of our drinking. We have to drink. Drinking solves all problems. The whole Bible ends with a promise and a call. The promise is in Revelation 22:14, &ldquo;Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.&rdquo; The call is in Revelation 22:17. &ldquo;Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&rdquo; The Bible closes with these two things. The promise is for eating and the call is for drinking. We must eat Jesus as the tree of life, and drink Him as the river of life. If all the Christians would forget their doctrines, opinions, and concepts, and only take care of the eating and drinking of Jesus, the whole world would be overturned.</p>
<p>For example, how can a young couple be one? I can guarantee that if they don&rsquo;t eat Jesus and drink of the Spirit, they could not go three days without disputing. If they would simply drink of the Spirit, there would be no problem. It is so simple, and it is altogether not something of religion. If this young couple would drink of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, they would be one. If they do not drink of Jesus, regardless of how much they talk about oneness, they could never be one.</p>
<p>Our God became a man, and then He became the life-giving Spirit. Today for our application, appropriation, and enjoyment, God is the life-giving Spirit. We may believe that He became man to die on the cross as our Redeemer, and yet we may still fight with our wife. It is wonderful that He is our Savior, but we need to apply Him as our life. The only way is to drink of the water of life. Drinking of the living water not only quenches our thirst, but also dispels all the problems. In John 7 such a Spirit was not yet, but today we can say that such a Spirit is here. Our Triune God is not a doctrine, neither is He a religion, a form, or a ritual. He is the life-giving Spirit, so available for us to drink.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY ONE THING COUNTS</h2>
<p>Teaching will never work. I knew some good Christian teachers that really knew the Bible. One among them was called the living concordance of the Bible. But after he had taught for an hour and a half, he would have to smoke. When I was young I appreciated his teaching, but I was really bothered by his smoking. He knew the Bible so well, yet he could not give up his smoking. This was because he had the Bible knowledge, but he did not have the drinking. All the Bible knowledge in the world cannot overcome your bad habits. But to drink of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit solves all our problems.</p>
<p>I knew some other people who were considered to be very spiritual. One among them was thought to be a very spiritual person. But I put a big question mark on that kind of spirituality. After many years, there is hardly anything left. So I came to a conclusion: no teaching avails, and nothing is spiritual. It is not a matter of declaring that we are for spirituality, and then we are spiritual. That will never work. Only one thing counts. Day by day, hour by hour, we must drink of the one Spirit.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much we know the Bible, if we do not drink for seven days, we will need a funeral. I don&rsquo;t care how spiritual you are. Those who do not drink will die. I saw these so-called spiritual ones dying. They claimed to be spiritual, yet they were so dead. Only one thing avails. We must all learn to drink of the one Spirit. The dispensing God today is the very Spirit for us to drink. He is so available and so drinkable.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a problem in your family. If I come to teach you, I will only damage you. But if I come to help you drink, I do believe your problem will be solved. It is so simple. By this drinking day by day, we get more of Christ into us. This is the indwelling. The indwelling comes out of our drinking of the one Spirit. The Lord Jesus today is the one Spirit, who is good for drinking. This one Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, who has passed through much process. He is our God, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Father, our Lord, our Master, and eventually our life-giving Spirit. We must be drinking of Him all the time. I do know what I am talking about. I have tried all the Christian ways, and nothing works but drinking.</p>
<p>Some people say that we must deny ourselves. I would ask you to try. Try to deny yourself. Eventually, you will have a stronger self. I know that the Bible tells us to deny ourself, but it is not in the letter. It must be in the Spirit. We must drink of the Spirit in order to deny ourselves. The whole context of the Bible indicates that we must walk in the Spirit and drink of the Spirit. The Bible does not end with the words, &ldquo;Deny yourself.&rdquo; It ends by saying, &ldquo;Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>In any kind of writing, the final word is the main thing. Matthew starts, but John closes. He gives the final word in the Gospels, the Epistles, the New Testament, and the whole Bible. Matthew started with putting us into Christ, and John closes with the drinking of Christ. This drinking is for the indwelling. We all must drink of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit. Even after reading this message, if we do not practice drinking, the reading avails nothing. We all must learn how to drink of the one Spirit all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO DRINK</h2>
<p>How do we drink of the Spirit? Praise the Lord that He has shown us the way. It is by calling on His name. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; John seven speaks about drinking, and Paul in 1 Corinthians 12 also talks about drinking. He tells us that we all have been made to drink of one Spirit. At the beginning of this book, he tells us how to drink. &ldquo;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2). To call is not simply to pray. The calling in chapter one is the drinking in chapter twelve. And the drinking Spirit in chapter twelve is the life-giving Spirit in chapter fifteen. The life-giving Spirit is the drinking Spirit, and the way to drink is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. Whenever we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are drinking of the one Spirit.</p>
<p>Many times when we try to pray, it is difficult to get through. We pray about this, and we pray about that, but we are thirsty within. This is not the kind of prayer that quenches our thirst. We must learn to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, You know the situation. I need You Lord, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Whether our prayer will be answered or not is secondary. The primary thing is that we are drinking of the Spirit. I can testify that only this one thing avails. We must learn to call deeply from within, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This is the way to be filled with the indwelling Christ. John closes the whole Bible with drinking, and this drinking continues for eternity. Hallelujah!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING BY THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:17-20; 15:4a, 5</h1>
<p>From the past messages, we see that most Christian teachings have altogether missed the mark. The lost ones, of course, have missed the mark, but even those who are saved have missed the mark. Man realizes that in his own life there is a lack, but he does not understand what the real shortage is. Christians know that they have been saved, but most of them do not have a clear vision that God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into them as their life. Regardless of whether we are saved or not, God&rsquo;s intention is still the same, that is, to work Himself into us as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHORTAGE IN MAN</h2>
<p>All human beings are short of something. In our daily life we are short of something. As husbands, we are short. As wives, we are short. Whether we are rich or poor, high or low, we are short. But so many do not realize that they are short. Even those that realize that they are short of God do not know that they are short of God as life.</p>
<p>Today on the earth there are many different things that appear good, yet they are so distracting. First there is religion. Then there is human culture. Besides this, there are the ethical teachings of many great philosophers and teachers. Many things are good, yet they are very misleading. Some may think that they are short of ethical teachings. Others may think that they are short of good character. But none of these things are our lack.</p>
<p>Perhaps some sisters think they are short of patience. In their home life with their husband and children, they always sense that they need more patience, and they always appreciate those who have more patience. But they really don&rsquo;t know what they are short of. The very ones they appreciate as having patience are also short. Those who don&rsquo;t have patience are short, and those who do have patience are also short. They are all short of the same thing.</p>
<p>What is it that we are all short of? Some will immediately answer, &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; This is right, but what do you mean by saying that we are short of Jesus? I am afraid that we have the same kind of saying, but a different dictionary. We say the same word, but our understanding differs. I have been doing this work for many years, and I still do not have the proper terminology or vocabulary. Some words are right, but they have been spoiled by Christianity, which has entirely missed the proper meaning of the proper words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>In the past messages we have seen something of God&rsquo;s intention from the Gospels of Matthew and John. But I am still not confident that you have seen the matter. Someone would say that our shortage is Jesus. But who is Jesus? There are thousands of different definitions of Jesus. It is very difficult to define Him, and yet it is also very simple. The most difficult things on earth are the most simple. I am breathing now, but perhaps in thirty minutes my breathing will stop, and that would mean death. What then is death? It is hard to define. It is also hard to define life. These are the most simple things, yet they are the most difficult. It is the same with Jesus. It is simple to understand Him, yet He is the hardest Person in the world to understand.</p>
<p>All human history, including all of Christianity and all other kinds of religion have missed the mark. And the mark is so simple. God wants to work Himself into man, and He has never changed His intention. In creation, God&rsquo;s intention was the same. In redemption, God&rsquo;s intention was the same. In salvation, God&rsquo;s intention is still the same. For eternity, God&rsquo;s intention will be eternally the same. God has never changed His intention. It is to work Himself into you and me as our life. Whether we are saved or lost, this does not change God&rsquo;s intention. If we are lost, we need God&rsquo;s intention. If we are saved, we still need God&rsquo;s intention. If we hate others, we need it. If we love others, we need it. Whether we are old or young, we need it. Whether we are strong or weak, we need it. Regardless of what we are, who we are, or where we are, we need God to work Himself into us.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING BY ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Some may feel that they know all of this already, but I am afraid that it is only a kind of doctrine to them. So many, including us, have come to know this doctrine. But there are not many who day by day, hour by hour, live by Christ. We all know the doctrine, but very few live it. The Lord Jesus told us in John 6:57, &ldquo;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.&rdquo; These are such simple words. The Lord said that He lived by the Father. The words are simple, but the effect is profound. To live by someone else&rsquo;s life is not a small thing.</p>
<p>All Christian wives know that the Bible teaches them to submit to their husband as their head. They must learn to live by their husbands. This saying is easy. Even a first-grader can say it. But to live it out is not so easy. I believe that all the sisters who are wives really love their husbands. But how many of these sisters actually live by their husbands? To love your husband is one thing, but to live by your husband is another.</p>
<p>However, there walked a person on this earth who said that He did not live by Himself. He lived by someone else. He was living, but it was not Him but the Father. He was living by the Father. And He said, &ldquo;He that eateth me, even he shall live by me.&rdquo; I believe that we all know this. But let me ask, in the past hour, by whom did you live? This is the problem.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with Matthew and John, but not many Christians have gotten into the heart of these two books in reality. These Gospels show us that God intends to get into us to be our life and be one with us. In order to do this, He first became incarnated. He mingled Himself with man. Then He went to the cross, solving all negative problems. After this He was resurrected to become something so mysterious, so profound, and yet so real. This was the life-giving Spirit, who is the very embodiment of the Triune God. The Father is in the Son, and the Son today is the wonderful Spirit. When we call on Him, He comes into us. This is the most simple thing, yet it is the most profound matter in the universe. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Triune God comes into us, mingles with us, and is one with us. Whenever we call on His name, we are in Him, and He is in us. This is not a superstition, but a fact. It is just like the air that we breathe. We are in the air, and the air is in us. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are in Him, and He is in us.</p>
<p>When we read the whole New Testament, we see that God became a man. Then He went to the cross to take away our sins, crucify our old nature, and terminate all negative things. He solved everything. After being put in a tomb for three days, He was resurrected to become a wonderful being&mdash;the life-giving Spirit, the embodiment, reality, and realization of the Triune God. When we have this Spirit, we have the Son, Jesus Christ, and we have the Holy Father. The Triune God is realized by us in the life-giving Spirit. Whenever we call on Him, we are in Him and He is in us.</p>
<p>In Romans 10:8-9, Paul says, &ldquo;But what saith it: The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shall confess with thy mouth, Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&rdquo; Both the Word and the Spirit are so nigh to us. They are even in our mouth and in our heart. If we will just exercise our heart and our mouth and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; immediately we are in Him and He is in us.</p>
<p>The problem is that after calling on Him, we don&rsquo;t live by Him. We still go back to our own ways and our own decisions. We may even begin to talk about some of the brothers and sisters in a negative way. After we call on Him, we forget to live by the One on whom we call. This is what Christians are short of today, and this is what we are short of. We are short of living by this life-giving Spirit. We must all learn to live by Him. This must not simply be a doctrine to us; it must be our experience day by day.</p>
<p>Matthew tells us that we have all been baptized into the Triune God. This means that we were baptized into Christ and into the one Body. Then John tells us that this Triune God has been processed into us just as water, food, and breath. Now we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. &ldquo;Abide in me, and I in you. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:4a, 5). To abide in Him means that we have been put into Him. And to let Him abide in us means that He is now within us. In other words, it is just as the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 2:20, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo; We have been terminated and buried in the Triune God. Now it is no more us, but Christ that lives in us. We have been put into Him, and now He is within us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SAME LIFE</h2>
<p>Suppose we have two brothers together. How many lives do they have? Some may say that they have two, others may say they have three. But I do not agree. They only have one life, and Christ is that very life. We all have the same life, because we all have Christ within us. But to have one life is one thing. To live by this life is another matter. The problem is that although we have one life, we live by another life. We all have one life, but we all live by different lives. Instead of living by Christ as our life, we live by our own life. We may have done nothing wrong. In fact, we may have lived the whole day without doing one wrong thing. But can we say that for the whole day we lived by Christ? There is a big difference.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He that eats me, even he shall live by me.&rdquo; This is not a standard of good nor a regulation of doing everything right. The standard and the regulation are just Christ. Good should not be our standard; neither should right be our regulation. Our standard and regulation must be the Lord Jesus Himself. Why do you not go to the movies? Is it because it is wrong? If this is the reason you do not go, I am afraid that you do not know how to live by Christ. The proper reason should be that the Lord Jesus does not wish to go. If He does not go, then I do not go. The reason we do not do something should never be because it is bad. It must be because the Lord Jesus does not do it. We should be one with Him, and we should live by Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REAL LOVE</h2>
<p>The real love is to live by the person you love. If we love the Lord Jesus, we should not try to do anything for Him. We should just live by Him. To live by Him is the real love. All wives know that it is much easier to do things for their husband than to live by their husband. They all know that to live by their husband will surely put them to the cross. Any wife can do good for her husband, but I am afraid that there is not one wife that really lives by her husband. To do things for your husband is one thing, but to take him as your person is another.</p>
<p>Many times I have told the Lord Jesus that I would do anything for Him. But He would say, &ldquo;I know that you will do things for Me, but you will not take Me as your person. You like to do things for Me, but you do not like to live by Me.&rdquo; To do things for the Lord is easy, but to live by Him is not so easy. To help a brother for the Lord&rsquo;s sake is easy, but to go to that brother living by the Lord is not so easy. To do things for the Lord requires no denial of the self, but to live by the Lord requires putting the self aside. Whenever we are going to contact a brother or a sister we must be abiding in the Lord and let Him abide in us. For without Christ we can do nothing. The problem is that without Christ we can do everything. We can talk without Christ. We can fellowship without Christ. We can do many things without Christ. But as far as God is concerned, what we do without Christ is nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>The indwelling of Christ is a life, not a doctrine. This indwelling Christ must become our daily life. The problem is that we all have been educated. We have been taught by all the religious teaching. We know all about the baptism, and we know the doctrine of the indwelling Christ. But who is living by Christ? There is the real need to practice the indwelling of Christ. This means that whatever we do, we must not do by ourselves, but by the Christ who lives in us. We must be able to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, it is not me doing this, it is You. You are the One who indwells me, and Your indwelling must be my daily life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The basic issues of the Gospels of Matthew and John are really simple. Matthew tells us to baptize into the name of the Triune God, and the Lord Jesus is with us all the days until the completion of the age. Then John tells us how the Lord breathed into His disciples. That is all. One book tells us that we have all been baptized into Him. The other tells us that He has breathed Himself into us. Now He is living within us. Matthew says that we are in Him, and John says that He is in us. It is so simple. Yet we stray from the simplicity of Christ.</p>
<p>We all have to come back again and again. Many times a day, hour after hour, we must come back to this one point that we are in Him, and He is living within us. He must be our daily Christ. When we practice this, we will see that our daily life will be enriched by the indwelling of Christ. Then our daily life will become so living and new. Whenever we come together in the meetings, we will always have something to share of Him because we will be so rich, so new, so fresh, and so one with the Lord in our spirit. His indwelling life will become our daily life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN ACTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5, 8; 6:3; 7:55; 9:4-5; 11:24; 13:52; 16:6-7</h1>
<p>We have seen something of the indwelling Christ in the four Gospels. Now we must come to the book of Acts. We may think that this is a book of the preaching of the early Apostles. However, it is just a record showing us how the early disciples were those who were baptized into the Triune God, and within whom the Triune God was living. In the Gospel of Matthew we are told that all the disciples are to be baptized into the Triune God. Then the Gospel of John tells us that this Triune God is today the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us. We are abiding in Him, and He is abiding in us.</p>
<p>Now in the book of Acts we see that all the early disciples were those who were put into the Triune God. At the beginning of Acts, they were all baptized in the Holy Spirit. They were put into the Triune God. Following this, we see that the Triune God was living within them. Many times in the book of Acts we read that they were full of the Holy Spirit. This simply means that these disciples were people within whom the Triune God was living. The Triune God was filling them and living within them. By this we clearly see that in the book of Acts the early disciples were baptized into the Triune God, and on the other hand the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit was living within them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CERTAIN KIND OF PEOPLE</h2>
<p>It was by this that they became a certain kind of people. They were people who had God Himself mingling with them. We know that we need to preach the Gospel and reach the unbelievers. Yet we should not do this in ourselves. We must be a kind of people who are put into the Triune God and who are filled with the Triune God. On one hand, we must be in the Triune God, and on the other hand, we need to have the life-giving Spirit living within us. This is the kind of people the early disciples were.</p>
<p>To be full of the Holy Spirit means to be in the condition of being continually filled with the Triune God. This was the daily situation, the daily walk, and the daily condition of the early disciples. At this time, the Holy Spirit is the full realization of the Triune God, the real embodiment of the Triune God. When we are full of the Holy Spirit, it means that we are filled with the Triune God. This is why the Lord Jesus did not tell them that they were to be preachers, but witnesses. &ldquo;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). They were not preachers, but witnesses, because they were in the Triune God, and the Triune God was in them. They and the Triune God were one. In other words, the indwelling of Jesus was their daily living; so in such a condition they were full of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many Christians today have been confused and complicated concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit. To be full of the Holy Spirit, they feel, is rather difficult. But it isn&rsquo;t that hard. It is as simple as breathing. I was once asked, &ldquo;How can we abide in Christ, and Christ abide in us?&rdquo; I answered by using the air as an illustration. All the time we are in the air, and the air is in us. And today the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is just like the heavenly air. We are in Him and He is in us.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us clearly that God has put us in Christ. &ldquo;But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.&rdquo; To be in Christ is something of God. God has put us into Christ, and God also has made Christ the life-giving Spirit. To be full of the Spirit is not such a difficult thing. As long as we open ourselves and confess all our sins so that there is no offense in our conscience, we can be full of the Spirit. If we confess and apply the blood to all our sinfulness, we are in Christ and Christ is in us. We should not be complicated by so many kinds of teachings about the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit. According to the record of the Bible, to be filled with the Spirit is really as simple as breathing. Jesus is not far from us. Rather, He is very nigh unto us. We know that He is indwelling our spirit. He is waiting within us that we may open up to Him and give Him the ground. As much ground as we will give to Him, He will fill. We only need to open ourselves to Him and make a thorough confession of anything that is sinful or condemned in His eyes. Then we must apply His redeeming and cleansing blood. If we do this, and keep calling on His name, we are spontaneously in Him, and He will spontaneously fill us. Then we will be in the situation that is described by the book of Acts as being full of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a Christian who loves the Lord, yet you would not be dealt with by Him. You have some sinful things in your life, yet you would not confess unto Him and apply His precious blood to cleanse you. If so, you are just insulated from Him. Electricity is a good illustration of this matter. We apply the electrical power by engaging the right switch. But if the electrical wire is insulated at the point of contact, there is no way to receive the electrical power. It is the same with the Lord. Just a little insulation will keep us from the heavenly power. If we would deal with all the insulation, we would get into the flow of the power.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICE AND FAITH</h2>
<p>This is simply a matter of practice and a matter of faith. We must practice to open ourselves to Him and deal with all our sinfulness. Whatever bothers our conscience, we must confess to Him. It is simply a matter of making a thorough confession. There is no need for us to stay in that kind of condemned situation. We only need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, forgive me in this matter. I am wrong and I need the cleansing of Your blood.&rdquo; Hallelujah for the redeeming and prevailing blood that cleanses us and sets us free! Under the blood there is no condemnation; we are released from all kinds of condemnation. Then we will say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. You are my life, You are my Person. Now I know that I am in You, and You are in me. Hallelujah! I know now that You are abiding within me.&rdquo; Then we are full of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not be so confused, distracted, and complicated. I am afraid that even after reading this, some would still think that to be full of the Holy Spirit is difficult, requiring much fasting and praying. But to be filled with the Holy Spirit is part of the Gospel, and the Gospel is absolutely free. It is not difficult, and we don&rsquo;t need to do so many things. What we do need to do is to open ourselves to the Lord and confess whatever is condemned in our conscience. Then we apply the cleansing of the precious blood. Our conscience then will be free, and there will be no offense. We will have a conscience void of offense. We will have boldness to call on the Lord and be filled by the Lord. The more we call on Him, the more we will be filled. We will be a person full of the Holy Spirit. At this time it will be so easy to preach the Gospel. We will not speak to others by exercising our mind to think what we must say. We will preach to others by exercising our spirit to flow out the living Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTFLOW OF THE INFILLING</h2>
<p>By reading the book of Acts carefully, we see that the early disciples did not have much knowledge or preaching. But they were people full of the Holy Spirit. Day by day, they were filled with the Triune God. When they reached out to others, it was by the outflowing of the indwelling Christ. This is exactly what is mentioned in Matthew and John. In Matthew we are told that the disciples of Jesus are baptized into the Triune God, and John tells us that Jesus will be living within them. Now in Acts we see such a group of people. All the early disciples were those that were put into Christ, and Jesus was living within them. They did not have all the things that people think we need today. When we are reaching others, what we need, strictly speaking, is not power, but the outflowing of the indwelling Christ. The real gospel is the outflow of Jesus from our spirit. It is not a matter of learning much, but of continually being full of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In Acts 6:3, 5, we see that the deacons chosen by the Apostles were men full of the Holy Spirit. &ldquo;Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in Acts 7:55, we see that Stephen, while he was being stoned to death, was full of the Holy Spirit. &ldquo;But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Acts chapter nine, we read that Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the early disciples. Then Jesus met him on the road to Damascus. &ldquo;And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks&rdquo; (Acts. 9:4-5). Saul was surprised when the Lord said that he was persecuting Him. But the Lord made it clear that to persecute the disciples was to persecute Him. While Stephen was being persecuted, he was full of Jesus. All the persecuted disciples were one with Jesus. They had been put into Jesus, and Jesus was living within them. Therefore, when they were persecuted, Jesus was being persecuted. This is why Jesus asked Paul, &ldquo;Why persecutest thou me?&rdquo; All the disciples were in Jesus, and Jesus was in them. To persecute them was to persecute Jesus, because whatever they did, it was Jesus doing it in them. When they were persecuted, Jesus considered that He was persecuted. Actually it was not Peter, John or Stephen that was persecuted, but it was Jesus who was indwelling all the disciples.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT PREACHING, BUT FILLING</h2>
<p>Wherever we go, we must be a people who are full of the Holy Spirit. We must be those who are in Jesus, and Jesus is living within us. It doesn&rsquo;t depend upon what we say. Eloquence in gospel preaching has never saved anybody. It is not our utterance that can impart life to others, but the pouring out of the indwelling Christ. We must learn how to be full of Jesus and to release Him from our spirit. Jesus wants to save others out of us, not out of the heavens. We should never let Him be stopped within us. All the time we must learn to release Him by opening ourselves and making a thorough and absolute confession of all our sins. Then we will have the boldness to call on Him to be filled with Him, and to share Him with others.</p>
<p>We really need to have faith in this matter. We should not doubt in the least. We should be fully assured that when we open ourselves and make a thorough confession to the Lord, applying His precious blood, we are in Him and He is in us! We must exercise our faith and say, &ldquo;Amen, Lord Jesus, I am one with You, and You are one with me. Hallelujah!&rdquo; This is the exercise of faith that we must have. We should not try to preach, but every day exercise our faith to be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>When the Apostle Paul was thinking of going to Asia from Phrygia, he was going there for Jesus. He was about to turn in one direction, but the Spirit did not allow him. &ldquo;Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not&rdquo; (Acts 16:6-7). On the one hand the Holy Spirit forbade them, and on the other hand the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. This shows that in the early days the apostles and disciples spread the gospel by being one with Jesus. It was not something done by themselves or according to their understanding, but something done by the indwelling Jesus. They were one with the Triune God, and this Triune God in Acts 16 is called both the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus. The Spirit is the embodiment and realization of the Triune God, and this Triune God was living in Paul. Paul was fully mingled with the Triune God. This is why he preached the Gospel in such a living way. Wherever he went, we can be sure that it was the decision of the Triune God within him.</p>
<p>I wish that we all could be so simple to be recovered back to the ways of the early disciples. We should not care so much for doctrine, preaching, or talk. We should only care for the outflowing of the indwelling Christ. We must learn to exercise our spirit and to exercise our faith. Then we will have the assurance that we are one with Christ, and He will flow out of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF FAITH</h2>
<p>To reach the unbelievers and to chase away the darkness requires a real exercise of faith. We all must learn to exercise our faith to deal with Satan. We are full of the Holy Spirit, so all the darkness and unbelief must go. We must challenge the enemy because we are not there by ourselves. We must tell the enemy, &ldquo;Satan, I am not here by myself. Jesus is one with me, and I am full of Him!&rdquo; Then we will see the enemy flee. We should not be bothered by today&rsquo;s Christianity, thinking that it is hard to be full of the Spirit. Whenever we are preaching the gospel, we should say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I open to You. Whatever You condemn, I condemn. Whatever You allow, I allow. Whatever You like, I like. I do believe that I am in You, and You are in me. Now that I&rsquo;m going out to preach the gospel, You have to go with me, and I have to go with You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we go out to reach others, we must have the assurance that we are really one with Jesus. This is what it means to be witnesses unto Him. We are not only going to preach the gospel, we are going out to be the witnesses. And we are not going to witness to the Jesus who is in the heavens, but to the Jesus who lives within us. He is in us, and we are in Him. We are just one in the Spirit. We have full assurance that we have been put into Him, and He is living within us. We are abiding in Him, and He is abiding in us. Then when we contact an unbeliever, we must exercise our spirit to release the living Jesus. And we must exercise our faith to deal with all the darkness. &ldquo;Satan, you have to go! Jesus is here!&rdquo; This is the way to be the real witnesses unto Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONDITION EASY TO ATTAIN</h2>
<p>To be full of the Spirit as described in the book of Acts is a condition which is easy for us to attain. If we open our heart and make a thorough confession of all our sins under the cleansing of the blood, we will be full of the Spirit. Then we must realize that we have been put into the Triune God, and we have the Triune God continually living within us. We are in Him, and He is in us. We should never look at ourselves or our background. We have to forget all of these things and realize that we are under the cleansing blood. All our past has been covered by the blood. We should never take away the covering of the blood to look at our past. Instead, we must declare that all our past is covered by the blood of Jesus! Now under the covering of the blood we are enjoying the Triune God and we are being filled with Him. This will make us the real witnesses.</p>
<p>This is the indwelling of Christ in the book of Acts. We see a group of people in whom Christ was living daily and through whom Christ was poured out as the gospel preaching. The real outreach is just the indwelling of Christ. And the indwelling of Christ is so simple. He is the processed God as the life-giving Spirit so nigh to us. Moment by moment we open ourselves to Him, confessing all our sinfulness. Then we will be under the cleansing of His blood and we will be filled with the fullness of the Holy Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN ROMANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10, 17; 6:3-6a; 8:1, 2, 9-11, 16, 23; 12:5-6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOSPELS, ACTS, EPISTLES</h2>
<p>The Gospels show us how Christ became a man that we could be put into Him, and how He became the Spirit so that He could come into us. Firstly, we have been put into Him. Then secondly, He comes into us and lives within. This is the main aspect of the Gospels.</p>
<p>Following this, the Acts show us a group of people who have been baptized into the Triune God, and now He is indwelling them as their life and they become His expression. So Acts, strictly speaking, is not a book of preaching, work or ministry. It is a record of a corporate people who have been put into the Triune God, and who have the Triune God living within them. They are such an extraordinary kind of human being. They are a kind that are mingled with God by being in God and having God living in them. Acts is not a book of activities, but a biography of such an extraordinary kind of being.</p>
<p>After Acts, there are the Epistles. We really must thank the Lord for the arrangement of the Scriptures. There is firstly the Gospels, then the Acts, and then the Epistle to the Romans. To understand the indwelling Christ, we need two things. We need the vision and we need the experiences. The experiences always come out of the vision. The four Gospels and the Acts give us the vision, and the Epistles tell us how to experience the indwelling Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO THE GOAL</h2>
<p>The book of Romans is considered by most Christians to be a book of justification by faith. A great section in this book covers the matter of justification by faith. But we all must realize that justification by faith is not the ultimate goal of this book. The ultimate goal is the Body of Christ. The beginning of the book speaks of justification by faith, but at the end, the book reaches the final goal of the Body of Christ. Between these two ends, we have the indwelling Christ. Romans starts with justification by faith and ends with the Body of Christ, but the central section speaks of the indwelling of Christ.</p>
<p>If we have only seen justification by faith, we have only seen the first part of the book of Romans. We appreciate the fact that the Lord used Martin Luther to recover the matter of justification by faith, but that is just the beginning of the book of Romans. We have to go on to reach the goal. The goal is the Body of Christ, and the way from justification by faith to the Body of Christ is the indwelling of Christ. Therefore, we can see that the indwelling of Christ is quite crucial and strategic. If we would reach God&rsquo;s goal from God&rsquo;s start, we must take God&rsquo;s way. This way is the indwelling Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONCILED TO GOD</h2>
<p>We need to see some of the more important verses on the indwelling of Christ in the book of Romans. The first is Romans 5:10, &ldquo;For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.&rdquo; This verse covers two main points. The first is that when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of Christ. We were not only sinners in the eyes of God, but also enemies. We were God&rsquo;s enemies, but, Hallelujah, we were reconciled! If we were only sinners we would only need forgiveness, but as enemies we needed reconciliation. Praise the Lord that we have not only been forgiven, but also reconciled. We were reconciled to God by the death of Christ. This is the ultimate consummation of justification by faith. There are no more problems between us and God. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful? All the problems have been solved. We have been reconciled to God by the redeeming death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUCH MORE SAVED BY HIS LIFE</h2>
<p>But this verse covers something more. And it is not only something more, but much more. &ldquo;Much more we shall be saved by His life.&rdquo; We have been reconciled, yet we still need some saving. Have you been saved? Are you sure that you have been saved? If you have been saved, why does this verse say that we shall be saved? What does this mean? Well, on one hand, we have been saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation, and we have been reconciled to God. Praise the Lord, we have been saved! But on the other hand there are still many negative things in our lives from which we need to be saved. I am afraid that as a wife you are not so happy with your husband, and as a husband, you are not so much at peace with your wife. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I am sure that it is something that you need to be saved from. Furthermore, we all have our temper and all our shortcomings from which we must be saved. The flesh, the old man, the self, the natural life all need a daily salvation.</p>
<p>We have been saved from so many things, yet we still need to be saved from more things. So, being reconciled, much more shall we be saved by His life. This saving is not by His death, but by His life. Here we must consider something. If Christ does not live within us, if He does not indwell us, how could we be saved by His life? If He is just in heaven sitting at the right hand of God, how could we be saved by His life? But, Hallelujah, Christ today is not only sitting at the right hand of God (Rom. 8:34), but also moving within us (Rom. 8:10). As He lives within us, we can enjoy His saving life. And the life of Jesus is simply Jesus Himself living in us. We should not consider that the life of Jesus is one thing, and Jesus Himself is another. The life of Jesus is Jesus Himself living within us.</p><h2 class="head1">DAILY SAVED BY HIS INDWELLING LIFE</h2>
<p>We all realize that Jesus died on the cross for our sins. So, through His death we received forgiveness from our sins, and we were reconciled to God. But after His death, He was resurrected to become the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to live within us. Now He lives within us as our life. It is by this indwelling life of Christ that we are daily being saved. We are daily saved from our bad temper, our shortcomings, our dissatisfactions with our husband or wife, and so many other things. I can testify that even today I have been saved at least eighteen times. I was not saved by His death, but by His indwelling life.</p>
<p>Once today something came to me from the enemy. A few days ago I had cast away that burden. Psalm 55:22 tells us to cast our burden upon the Lord. In the original language it means to throw away your burden. So I did throw away this burden to the Lord, and the burden was gone. But today Satan tried to bring the burden back to me. I turned to the Lord and said, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, You are my life.&rdquo; Immediately the burden went away. So I was saved from this burden by the living Jesus who lives in me.</p>
<p>I will give you another testimony of being saved by His life. This evening when my wife called me to dinner, a little temptation came to speak negatively about someone to my wife. But again I began to call on the Lord. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Immediately I had the deep sensation that I should not say those things. So I was saved again by the indwelling Christ. Much more we shall be saved by His life! I said that I was saved eighteen times today, but it may have been more than eighteen times. Not only today, but every day I am saved by Jesus living within me as my life. The more I take Him as my life in my daily walk, the more I am saved.</p>
<p>Now let me say something to the sisters. I hope they will not be offended. We know that all human beings like to gossip. But the sisters are experts in gossiping. It would be very difficult for the most spiritual sisters not to gossip. But if the sisters would take Jesus as their life, this living Jesus would save them from their gossiping. Then they could save their strength for praying. There is no need for us to waste our time and strength in gossiping. We can be saved by the living Jesus within us. Then we will have more time and strength for prayer. &ldquo;Much more we shall be saved by His life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">REIGNING IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Then Romans 5:17 says, &ldquo;For if by one man&rsquo;s offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We are not only saved by His life, but we can also reign as kings in life. A king is one that is above all. Everything is under him. Praise the Lord that we can reign in life! All things will be subdued under our feet. We are reigning in Jesus who lives in us as life. This Jesus living within us is even the kingdom. He is the kingdom, and within Him, we can be a king subduing and conquering all things. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Sometimes a brother will say, &ldquo;By God&rsquo;s mercy I was barely saved from losing my temper.&rdquo; Well, this is good, but it is too poor. What we need is to be king over our temper, not to be barely saved from our temper. Then we can tell our temper, &ldquo;Be quiet. I&rsquo;m the king over you.&rdquo; All people like to be a king, but no one can be king over his temper. Our temper is usually a king over us. But by Christ living in us as our life, we have the position to reign in life over our temper. We are not only saved, but also reigning in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>From Romans five we must go on to Romans six. Here we see how we can be saved in life and how we can reign in life. The reason is that we all have been baptized into Christ. &ldquo;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him&rdquo; (Rom. 6:3-6).</p>
<p>Here is one place where I appreciate the King James Version. It says that we all have been baptized <em>into</em> Christ. It is not <em>unto,</em> but <em>into.</em> We all have been baptized into Christ, and this means to be baptized into His death. So by burial we have been put into death. This means that the baptism into Christ is a kind of termination. Hallelujah! We all have been buried into Christ. We all have been terminated in Christ. This gives Christ the opportunity to live in us. Our termination is His germination. We are terminated in Him, and He is germinated within us. Now He lives within us, and we walk in newness of life. We were first buried into Him and then we were resurrected with Him to walk in newness of life as He lives within us. This is the indwelling of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;IN CHRIST&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Now we come to Romans eight. This chapter begins with a declaration in the first verse. &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; I like this term, &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; We all have been put into Christ, and now we are in Christ. In Christ there is no condemnation because in Christ there is nothing negative, dark or sinful. If we are outside of Christ, we will be full of condemnation. But in Christ everything is in the light. Therefore there is no condemnation. We should not look at ourselves or consider our situation. If we look at ourselves, we will be in real trouble. Therefore we must realize that we are in Christ. Just as Paul declared it, we must declare it. We all need to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I am in Christ, and here there is no condemnation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>There is no condemnation in Christ because in Christ there is a law. &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death&rdquo; (Rom. 8:2). In Christ there is the law of the Spirit of life. A law is a natural governing principle. We all know that gravity is a law. If you throw anything into the air, it comes down. There is no need to pray to the Lord to send it back to earth. If we pray in that way, we are foolish. The law of gravity will take care of it. It is the same way in Christ. In Christ there is the law of the Spirit of life. The law, the Spirit, and the life are all in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF REJOICING</h2>
<p>More than thirty years ago I was deep in trial. I remembered the verse that said we must rejoice in the Lord. I was suffering very much; so I really needed to rejoice. But how could I rejoice? I tried to rejoice again and again, but I simply could not do it. Now I understand. To rejoice is not an act; it is a law. If we try to rejoice, that is just an act. It will never work. But if we keep the principle of the spiritual law, spontaneously we will be rejoicing. Rejoicing is a law that belongs to the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is nothing less than Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Christ Himself is the Spirit of life, and within Him there is such a law.</p>
<p>When I tried to rejoice more than thirty years ago in that situation, I failed. But now I have learned to call on the Lord. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; After calling for a few minutes, it is easy to rejoice, for the rejoicing One lives within me. That is the law. When we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we touch Him, and He is the Spirit of life. Within Him there is the law of rejoicing. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord that there is such a law within us!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF HOLINESS</h2>
<p>Within Christ there is also the law of holiness. When we have Jesus living within us as our life, spontaneously it will be easy to be holy. This is because holiness is a law. Since Christ lives within us as our life and our person there is a law of holiness. Regardless of how many times the Devil casts us into a defiled situation, the law of holiness spontaneously keeps us from being unholy. This is the law of the Spirit of life. Christ living within us as our life, is the Spirit of life. In this Spirit of life there is an automatic law that frees us from anything of sin and death. Hallelujah! There is no condemnation in Christ for the law of the Spirit of life has set us free from the law of sin and death. This is the indwelling Christ with the liberating law within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STANDING LAW</h2>
<p>According to many of the teachings in Christianity, it seems that it is very hard for a Christian to stand. I am afraid that there are still many that hold this kind of concept. But this is absolutely a wrong teaching. To fall is really hard. While you are standing, try to fall. It is not so easy. We can all stand so steadfastly because of the gravity of the earth. It is harder for a Christian to fall than to stand. Many times I have tried to fall away from the meetings. Even though I tried to fall, I still ended up in the meeting. It is not so easy for us to fall. Occasionally we may stumble, but immediately we will regain our footing. After stumbling, we will hate what has happened. This will make us more careful the next time concerning what caused us to stumble. A Christian has a standing law. Within all Christians there is the standing strength and the standing governing principle. This is the life of Christ as the standing law within us. The law of the Spirit of life has set us free.</p><h2 class="head1">NO MORE IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>We must continue in Romans eight. &ldquo;But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness&rdquo; (Rom. 8:9-10). Here we read that we are not in the flesh. This shows how much we have been cheated by the enemy. So many Christians are continually bemoaning the fact that they are so fleshly. But this is a lie! We are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. This is the word of Romans 8:9. Whose word is more trustworthy? Yours or the Bible&rsquo;s? The Bible says that we are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. So we must believe the word of the Bible. Our word is nothing. Only the word of the Bible is reality. Let us forget about our word and take the word of the Bible. We are no more in the flesh, but in the spirit. We know this because of the word of the Bible. Hallelujah! We are no longer in the flesh because the Spirit of God dwells in us. This is the indwelling of Christ. It is only the indwelling Christ that causes us to be no more in the flesh.</p>
<p>We can realize from these verses that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. And the Spirit of Christ is simply Christ Himself. So eventually we have these words, &ldquo;If Christ be in you.&rdquo; These are not small words. They are too great. We all have to shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Christ is in us.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful? We have such a wonderful person in us. And this person is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALK IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Therefore, we are a wonderful person in the spirit because the Spirit of life is now in our spirit. &ldquo;The Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God&rdquo; (Rom. 8:16). Christ is such a wonderful Spirit, and we have a spirit. And Christ as the wonderful Spirit of life is now in our spirit. This is where we are to walk. We should not look at our environment, our situation, or ourself. We should only look at Romans chapter eight. Whenever Satan comes to cause us to look at something else, we must tell him, &ldquo;Satan, look at Romans eight!&rdquo; Satan will only say, &ldquo;Look at yourself, look at your circumstances, look at your situation.&rdquo; But we do not have to look at these things. Romans eight says that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. Hallelujah!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORETASTE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Then Romans 8:23 tells us that the indwelling Christ within us is a real taste. &ldquo;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the foretaste of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.&rdquo; Christ as the Spirit within us is a real foretaste. A foretaste means two things. It means that the taste is so fresh, and it also means that a full taste will follow. Hallelujah! Christ is the Spirit, Christ is the life, and Christ is also the taste. We can enjoy Christ before Satan. The Lord spreads a table in the presence of our enemies. The indwelling Christ is not only our life, but also our taste. How enjoyable is the indwelling Christ! And how Satan hates to see us enjoying Him! Praise the Lord that we have such a One indwelling us!</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE BODY IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Eventually, the issue of the enjoyment of the indwelling Christ brings us to the goal of the book of Romans. &ldquo;For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same function: so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another&rdquo; (Rom. 12:4-5). We are all members of one Body in Christ. This is also seen in the last chapter, Romans sixteen. In this chapter, we find four times the phrase, &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; Another four times it says, &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; Sister so-and-so is a person in the Lord, and brother so-and-so is a brother in Christ. &ldquo;In the Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; are altogether mentioned eight times in this one chapter.</p>
<p>Most of the expositors of Romans do not mention much concerning Romans sixteen. They say that it is just a chapter of greetings. They do not feel that &ldquo;greet brother so-and-so&rdquo; and &ldquo;greet sister so-and-so&rdquo; are very important. But I like Romans sixteen as much as the previous fifteen chapters. So many times we read in Christ, in Christ, in Christ Jesus, in the Lord, in the Lord. Hallelujah! Today, in the church, we are those who are &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; If we are not in the Lord, we are not brothers and sisters. But, praise the Lord, we are all in the Lord. I have underlined my Bible eight times in Romans sixteen where it says &ldquo;in the Lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; This is not some kind of vain repetition. These words really mean something. When we are in the Lord, the Lord is automatically in us. This makes us members of one Body in Christ. Then we have the church life. So, in Romans sixteen the church is mentioned several times.</p>
<p>For this reason, Romans fifteen tells us to be like-minded one to another according to Christ. &ldquo;Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 15:5-6). We are not like-minded according to the objective Christ in the heavens, but according to the subjective Christ who lives in us. Christ lives in every one of us, and we all have Christ as our life. This is the reason we are one. We could never be like-minded according to anything else. We only have one accord, and that is Christ. And this is for the church. The indwelling Christ is our one accord and our oneness. It is in this way that we all can have one mind and one mouth to glorify God in the church life. There may be thousands of us, yet we still all have one mind and one mouth because of the indwelling Christ. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Now we are clear how Romans starts from justification by faith, goes through the indwelling of Christ, and brings us to the goal of the one Body of Christ, that is the church. Now we can enjoy Christ in the one Body, the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST<br />
IN 1 CORINTHIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 24, 30; 3:16; 6:17; 12:12-13; 15:45b</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE INNER VISION</h2>
<p>We must now look at the matter of the indwelling Christ in 1 Corinthians. We may think that the books of the Bible cover different things, and apparently this is so. The Gospels give the story of Jesus&rsquo; life. The Acts are a record of the Apostles and the early disciples. Romans is a book of doctrines, and 1 Corinthians covers the gifts, as well as many different teachings. It seems that all of these books speak of different matters. Yet, with insight and inner vision, we can see that all these books consistently deal with the matter of the indwelling Christ. This is the basic concept of every book of the New Testament.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t consider Christ as separate from the Father and from the Spirit. We all must realize that Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God. And Christ is realized in the Spirit. It is by the indwelling of Christ that the Triune God is mingling Himself with us.</p>
<p>We saw clearly in Romans that all the justified ones are now enjoying the indwelling Christ as their life and as their everything, and how this kind of enjoyment eventually issues in the Body. The Body of Christ comes out of such an enjoyment of the indwelling Christ. Now in 1 Corinthians we will see that the basic concept is exactly the same as in Romans. Of course, Romans does not cover the gifts, marriage, or many of the other things that are covered in 1 Corinthians. But underneath, the basic concept is the same. That is, we all have been put into Christ so that by His indwelling in our spirit His Body will be produced. In this way, 1 Corinthians covers the same thing as Romans. The only difference is that Romans is a book of doctrines, whereas 1 Corinthians is a book of dealings. In 1 Corinthians, Paul deals with divisions, different opinions about the gifts, lawsuits, marriage, eating sacrifices offered to idols, and the matter of resurrection. However, the basic concept of these two books is the same. We all have been baptized into the Triune God, and now this Triune God is fully realized in the life-giving Spirit, who indwells us as our life in order that the Body of Christ may come into being.</p>
<p>Hence, we see that both Romans and 1 Corinthians cover the same basic concept. This is what we call a vision. We all need to see this vision. Without it we will not have the insight we need when we come to the book of 1 Corinthians. Instead, we will merely take note of all the problems. Some teachers say that 1 Corinthians deals with ten great problems: the problem of division, dealing with sinful believers, lawsuits, marriage, eating sacrifices offered to idols, the Lord&rsquo;s Table, headcovering, the gifts, love, and resurrection. Twenty years ago in Hong Kong I had a conference on the solving of these ten big problems. I said then that Christ and the cross were the answer to all the problems. Now, twenty years later, I have seen something more. The book of 1 Corinthians was not written simply to solve problems. Even if you solve the problem of a husband and wife, you only help them to have a good marriage life. That does not necessarily help them to gain Christ. Whether you have a good married life or a bad married life is not of much consequence. But 1 Corinthians does tell us something that really counts. We have all been baptized into the Triune God who is realized in the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13), and now this Triune God lives in us to be our everything! He does not dwell in us simply to solve the problems of our marriage life. He lives in us to be everything to us. This is much higher than mere problem solving. But due to the shallow understanding, shallow interpretation, shallow exposition among the Christians, all the deep things have been veiled from God&rsquo;s children (1 Cor. 2:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;IN CHRIST&rdquo;</h2>
<p>For instance, in 1 Corinthians 1:2 we are told that the church people are sanctified in Christ. &ldquo;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus....&rdquo; What does it mean to be sanctified in Christ? Some may stress the word &ldquo;sanctify,&rdquo; but I would rather stress the phrase &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; The church people are people in Christ. As long as we are in Christ, we are sanctified. To be sanctified means to be separated, made no more common, made something special. We all are specialities. We are no longer common because we are in Christ. &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; really means to be special, uncommon, and altogether different from other people. We are neither Americans nor Europeans nor Orientals. We are people in Christ! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It is &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; that we are enjoying the fellowship of Christ. And God has called us into this fellowship. &ldquo;God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:9). This simply means to participate in Christ and to partake of Christ. Christ is our inheritance and our spiritual portion, and we have been called into the participation in this Person. This is to be in Christ. To be in Christ is to enjoy all that Christ is, and this enjoyment is the fellowship. The fellowship of Christ is just the participation in all that Christ is.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POWER AND WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>This Christ in whom we are participating is the power of God and the wisdom of God. &ldquo;But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:24). Our Christ is everything. He is not only the wisdom, but also the power. He is not only the way, but also the ability. This is the Christ as our portion into whom we have been called. We have not been called into anything else. As our portion He is the power to do things and He is the wisdom to accomplish things. He is everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFERRED</h2>
<p>Then 1 Corinthians tells us that it is of God that we are in Christ. &ldquo;But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:30). We were all born in Adam. We were not born in Christ. But one day God accomplished a kind of translation. He translated us from one sphere into another. We were born into Adam, but God has transferred us from Adam into Christ. Hallelujah! It is of God that we are in Christ. To be in Christ is a great thing. We all must realize that we have been transferred. We did not do it. Even if we tried, we could never make it. But, praise the Lord, God can do it, and He did it! It is of God that we all have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</p>
<p>I can testify that before I was transferred, I fully realized that I was in a certain kind of sphere. But then God put me into another sphere, the wonderful Person of Christ. It is of God that we are in Christ. We did nothing but open ourselves to the Lord. I remember the day that I was transferred. I said, &ldquo;God, I want You today. I don&rsquo;t want this world. I am through with this world, and this world is through with me. I just want You.&rdquo; At that moment God took me out of that sphere and put me into another sphere. I was transferred by God out of Adam and into Christ.</p>
<p>In the first years I tried a number of times to go back. I even told God that I was not so happy to be in this sphere. It seemed that God said, &ldquo;All right, you try your best to go back. You didn&rsquo;t get into this sphere by yourself. I put you here. And unless I put you back, you can never go back.&rdquo; I tried several times, but I couldn&rsquo;t make it. I couldn&rsquo;t go back. Can you? I assure you that you cannot. Hallelujah! We all have been put into Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS EVERYTHING BY HIS INDWELLING</h2>
<p>God has put us into Christ, and now this Christ has been made our power, our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. God put us into Him, and God made Him everything to us. Hallelujah! In the first place God transferred us into Him. He took us out of Adam, and put us into Christ. Then from that day God made Christ everything to us. He&rsquo;s our power, our wisdom, our justification, our sanctification, our redemption, our everything!</p>
<p>But how can Christ be everything to us? It is by His indwelling. In 1 Corinthians 3:16 we are told that we are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God is the dweller. &ldquo;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&rdquo; We are the dwelling, and He is the dweller. We have already seen that the Spirit of God is the full realization of Christ. We should never consider that the Spirit of God here is separate from Christ or other than Christ. He is the Spirit of Reality (John 14:17). This means that He is the reality of Christ. The real Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the dweller. He dwells in us, and we are His dwelling place.</p>
<p>It is by His dwelling in us that He is everything to us. If we need righteousness, He is our righteousness. If we need holiness, He is our holiness. If we need justification, He is our justification. If we need sanctification, He is our sanctification. And eventually, Christ will be the redemption to our body. He is all these things to us by His indwelling. Suppose God put us into Christ, and He did nothing more. We may be in Christ, but there is no way to apply Christ as everything to us. To be in Christ is a positional matter. But to have Christ as our everything is something of experience. On one hand, we have been put into Christ. And on the other hand, He is made everything to us. But His being everything to us is by His indwelling.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INDWELLING SPIRIT, THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT,<br />
AND THE SPIRIT OF DRINKING</h2>
<p>Today, Christ as the indwelling Spirit indwells our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The very Christ who is made everything to us is now in our spirit. And we are one spirit with Him, continually enjoying His indwelling. This is made clear by the above mentioned verses and the last part of 1 Corinthians 15:45, &ldquo;The last Adam was made a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; We can never forget this verse.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Spirit of God dwells in us. Now we see that this Spirit is Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Then 1 Corinthians 12:13 shows us something more. &ldquo;For in One Spirit were we all baptized into one body...and were all made to drink of one Spirit.&rdquo; Now we have the Spirit that dwells in us, the life-giving Spirit, and the Spirit that is good for drinking. Do you believe that these are three Spirits? Of course not. We all know that these three are just one Spirit. The Spirit of God is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of drinking. Eventually, we see that Jesus is just a kind of drink to us. Day by day we are drinking of Him.</p>
<p>We all know that baptism is to put people into the water, and drinking is to put the water into people. This is exactly what 1 Corinthians 12:13 says. We have been baptized in one Spirit, and now we are all drinking of that one Spirit. We also have seen that these two aspects are also recorded in Matthew and John. In Matthew, we were baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Then in John, this Triune God gets into us (John 14:17, 20). Now 1 Corinthians tells us the same thing. We have been baptized into the Spirit and we are drinking of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>To drink of Christ as the Spirit is the way that we apply Him as our everything. When we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we take a drink of Him. By doing this, we partake of Jesus as our strength. When we are sorrowful, we drink of Him as our joy. The more we drink of Him in this way, the more we practically take Him as our person. We don&rsquo;t live by ourselves anymore, but by Him.</p>
<p>There are not many Christians that practice this kind of drinking. We do praise the Lord in the last few years, many saints among us have begun to practice in this way. Yet I still feel that our practice is not adequate. It must be intensified. We should never consider that we are professional in this matter. All day long we must practice the drinking of Jesus. We have all been put into Him (Gal. 3:27), and He is made everything to us. But He can only be everything to us by His indwelling, and we can only realize His indwelling by our drinking of Him. All day long we must drink of this life-giving Spirit. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This is the real drink of the Spirit.</p>
<p>If our husband or wife begins to argue with us, we should not use our mouth to argue with them. Instead, we must use our mouth to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; While they are arguing, we must drink of the Lord Jesus in this way. It is by this drinking that we enjoy the indwelling of Jesus. And it is by His indwelling that He becomes everything to us in a practical way. This is the way to take Him as our person. Whatever we are going to do, we must say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Whenever we are going to the store to make some purchases we must say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we are beginning to argue with someone, first of all we must say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; It seems so simple, like the practice of a little child. But there is no other way that is so living, practical, real, and prevailing. Jesus as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit, and we must all learn to drink of Him again, and again, and again.</p>
<p>I recently heard of a couple in New Zealand that drinks eleven cups of tea a day. That really seems to be a lot of drinking, but to drink eleven times of Jesus in a day is too little. We must drink of Him hundreds of times. Do you think that to drink of Jesus one hundred times in one day is too much? No! It could never be too much. We must learn to drink of Him countless times a day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS IN ONE VERSE</h2>
<p>Now we can see that 1 Corinthians has one verse that puts the two aspects together. We all have been baptized in one Spirit, and we all have been made to drink of one Spirit. To be baptized into one Spirit is revealed in Matthew, and to drink of one Spirit is basically revealed in John (John 7:37-39; 4:14). Now in 1 Corinthians we have one verse which puts these books together. Paul is quite wise. In one short verse he covers Matthew and John. We all have been baptized into the Triune God, and now this wonderful One is our drink. We all have been put into this wonderful water, and we all have been positioned to daily take this water into us. It is by this daily drinking that He is made everything to us, and we learn to take Him as our person and live by Him. Then eventually we become His expression on the earth as the corporate Christ. It is all by the indwelling of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST<br />
IN 2 CORINTHIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:8-9, 12; 4:9, 16; 5:17; 10:1a; 11:10; 12:9; 13:5, 14</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians is a much deeper book than 1 Corinthians. I would even say that this is the deepest book, telling us how a person lived by Christ. And we know that this person who lived by Christ was the Apostle Paul.</p>
<p>Paul taught us much in Romans and 1 Corinthians that God&rsquo;s intention is to work Christ into us that we may experience Him as our life, our person, and our everything! This will produce the church life, and then the individual Christ will become the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ. After these two books, we have another book which does not teach us, but which gives us a history. Paul did not write any autobiography, yet 2 Corinthians may be considered as a kind of autobiography written by Paul himself. This is not a book of doctrines, but the story of a personal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRESSED OUT OF MEASURE</h2>
<p>The first chapter opens in this way. It tells us that Paul was pressed out of measure, beyond his strength. &ldquo;For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our tribulation which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, beyond strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life&rdquo; (2 Cor. 1:8). What kind of doctrine is this? And then he says that this kind of pressure was given so that he would not live by man&rsquo;s wisdom, but by the grace of God. &ldquo;For our rejoicing [boasting] is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to youward&rdquo; (2 Cor. 1:12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF GOD</h2>
<p>As Paul continues, he tells us what the grace of God is. The grace of God is nothing less than Christ Himself experienced and enjoyed by us. Paul opens this book by speaking of grace, and he ends it by speaking of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. In chapter 12, Paul testifies how the Lord Jesus dealt with him assuring him that His grace was sufficient. This is not a teaching, but a testimony. Paul testifies to us that after he became an apostle he did not live by himself. He didn&rsquo;t have his conversation, which means his living or his walk, in a human way. He did not live by his human wisdom but by the grace of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>To learn this doctrine is easy, but to get into such an experience requires a lot of pressure. We should never think that it is because we are so evil that God must give us so many troubles, tribulations and trials. If this is true, what about the Apostle Paul? Was he that bad? I believe that he was quite good; he was so faithful to God and honest to those around him. Yet why did God ordain so much trouble and tribulation for him?</p>
<p>All Christians have a kind of religious concept. If anyone gets into trouble or loses his health, immediately his friends begin to think that he is sinful in some matter. Otherwise, how could God let him suffer so much? Suppose after two weeks, I were to become very ill. At least fifty percent of those hearing this word would think that I was wrong in some thing. Otherwise, how could a servant of the Lord be so seriously sick? Or if I were to get into a certain kind of trouble, many would think that God was dealing with my wrong doing.</p>
<p>This kind of concept is religious and traditional. We all have inherited this kind of concept from our forefathers. But what was wrong with Paul? Nearly all Bible expositors agree that Paul had a kind of physical weakness (2 Cor. 12:9). Some of them feel that this weakness was the loss of his sight. In Galatians he speaks of them giving their eyes to him (Gal. 4:15), and about the large letters he is writing (Gal. 6:11). Several of his epistles were not written by him, but by someone to whom he dictated (Rom. 16:22). Because of these points, some feel that Paul had very weak eyes. In any case, there was a kind of weakness or affliction in his physical body. Due to this, he prayed three times for the Lord to heal him. We know that Paul himself brought many miraculous healings upon others. But now he could not heal himself. He prayed to the Lord, and the Lord answered him. For the Lord to answer does not mean that He does what we ask. &ldquo;And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>
<p>Paul prayed three times for the Lord to take away this physical weakness. But the Lord answered, &ldquo;No. I will not remove this weakness. If I did, you would lose the opportunity to experience My sufficient grace. My strength is not made perfect in your strength but in your weakness.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">FALLEN AND INDEPENDENT</h2>
<p>Regardless of how spiritual we are, we must remember that we are fallen. We were born fallen because our first father fell six thousand years ago. A fallen person is an independent person. All mothers know that there is not one child that is not independent. Whether they are American, Chinese, Western or Oriental, the first word they learn is &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Whatever their mothers say, the answer is &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Our fallen nature is independent.</p>
<p>Even the sisters who are wives are still very independent. However, they would say it in a nicer way. They would say that to keep their independence is to keep their prestige. For them to submit to their husbands is to lose their prestige. But that is really not the case. The case is just the independence of our fallen nature.</p>
<p>The principle of the tree of knowledge is simply the principle of independence. Knowledge makes people independent. Students, after they finish their course, graduate from school and then become so independent. But can you graduate from life? It is impossible. This is why the principle of the tree of life is dependence. Yesterday we ate, we drank, we breathed, and we slept. But today we still must do the same. We could never say that because we learned to breathe well yesterday, that today we have graduated from breathing. You can graduate from any kind of knowledge, but you cannot graduate from anything of life. The tree of life means dependence, and the tree of knowledge means independence. It was at the fall of man that the tree of knowledge, which means the nature of independence, got into man. This is why we were born independent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>However, God&rsquo;s economy depends upon our dependence. On one hand God created us as an individual with a proper will. Yet in God&rsquo;s salvation, God comes into us that we may take Him as our person. This means that we should no longer live by ourself, but by Him. To say this is easy, but to experience it is not so easy.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. God has created you as a complete unit, a perfect individual. You have your will, your likes, and your dislikes. You have your thoughts and intentions. You are a perfect individual being. You also have your personality. However, God&rsquo;s creation is one thing, but God&rsquo;s salvation is another. God&rsquo;s creation is to create us in such a way, but in His salvation, He Himself comes into us to be our life and our person. He dwells in us, and we must live by Him. This is really good, but we have a problem. Now besides ourself, we have another person. This means that now we must be willing to be dependent upon this person, forgetting about ourselves.</p>
<p>In all weddings, the bride has her head covered. This means that in a family, there can be only one head. But immediately after the wedding, they take away the covering. To tell the truth, I have never seen a person fully dependent upon and submissive to another person. I never saw such a one because we were all born fallen and independent. To our feeling, to depend upon others is a kind of shame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF PRESSURE</h2>
<p>But in God&rsquo;s salvation, what is needed is our dependence. However, it is not easy to give up our independence. Therefore, the pressure is needed. God is sovereign. He brings in a certain kind of pressure to take away our independence. This is why there is not one Christian that does not have trouble. Nearly all the husbands are a tribulation to the wives, and all the wives are a tribulation to the husbands. Moreover, all the children are tribulations. I met a certain brother in 1958, and then I saw him again in 1960. At that time I realized that he had nearly no pressure from the little ones. But just five years later, in 1965, I noticed that the little ones had become a pressure to him. There are no parents who can testify that their children are not a pressure to them. Every child is a tribulation. The more children you have, the more tribulations you have.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FATHER&rsquo;S HAND</h2>
<p>Everything is ordered by our Father&rsquo;s hand. In doing everything, including the Lord&rsquo;s work, we expect it to be one way, but it turns out to be another. Many times, we simply cannot tell the reason why it happened that way. We may inquire why, but the answer is always the same. Our Father&rsquo;s hand ordered it. You need it, and I need it. We all need it.</p>
<p>For example, the Chinese people like to take much time, with the help of their parents, to select their partner in marriage. But the American young people are more simple. After getting to know each other for two months, they marry. But regardless of how selective we are, it does not depend on our selection. It is all under the Father&rsquo;s hand. You don&rsquo;t know what kind of wife you need, but the Father knows. And you don&rsquo;t know what kind of husband you need, the Father knows. No wife is a wrong wife, and no husband is a wrong husband. They were all selected by the Father. What we get is exactly what we need. Our Father&rsquo;s hand could never be wrong. We may think that we made the wrong choice, but God the Father still is right. If His little finger touched our marriage plans just a little, that marriage could never occur. A number of times I made some mistakes. I regretted much, but then I started to thank God. &ldquo;Father, I thank Thee that I made a mistake.&rdquo; I realized that without making such a mistake I would never have such a good opportunity to experience the grace of Christ.</p>
<p>To talk about taking Christ as our person is easy, but to get to the experience requires much pressure. Otherwise, we would not give up our independence. We need to be pressed out of our measure, beyond our strength. We must even despair of life. Paul said, &ldquo;But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead&rdquo; (2 Cor. 1:9). To have the sentence of death means that, to Paul&rsquo;s understanding, he should die. But hallelujah! He was resurrected!</p>
<p>All of us expect to have a good job. And in doing business, everyone likes to make a profit. Eventually, sometimes, the profit is taken to the moon. This is the act of God. Praise the Lord! The Father&rsquo;s hand ordered it. He ordered it just to press us that we should not trust in ourselves, but in the living God who raises the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTWARD MAN CONSUMED,<br />
THE INWARD MAN RENEWED</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s autobiography opens with tribulation. This man who experienced Christ was a man under pressure beyond his strength. He felt he was dying. He even had the sentence of death. He despaired of life. What was the meaning of all this? It was simply the killing of the fallen man. The putting to death of Jesus was indoctrinated into his life. And that death of Christ was doing the killing work. It was not only by the living Spirit within, but also through all the circumstances without. This is why he said, &ldquo;For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is consumed, yet the inward man is renewed day by day&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:16). The inward man is our spirit with Jesus living within it. Our regenerated spirit with the indwelling Christ is the inward man.</p>
<p>Christ lives with our inward man, but the problem is this: who is doing the living, He or we? Every day, from morning to night, by whom do we live? Do we live by our self, or by Christ? We have heard many messages telling us to take Jesus as our person. But who is really our person? We really have to pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, forgive me, I didn&rsquo;t take You as my person very much today. I just didn&rsquo;t live by You.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOMETHING UNDER PRESSURE</h2>
<p>We must realize that the indwelling of Christ is not a doctrine. It is a daily experience. If we all have a daily experience of the indwelling Christ, it will enrich the church life and strengthen the church&rsquo;s testimony. But we can never get into this experience by being taught. It has to be accomplished under pressure. We need to be pressed out of measure, beyond our strength, that we may despair even of life. We even need to have the sentence of death in ourselves. This is God&rsquo;s purpose, because only death brings in resurrection. We all have to be brought to the end. Then we will trust in the living God who raises the dead.</p><h2 class="head1">A LIFE OF SUFFERING</h2>
<p>We all have been terminated in the Triune God. And this Triune God has germinated us. But the problem is that we go back to the old person with the old living. So we need the tribulation. In a sense, the Christian life is a life of enjoyment, but in another sense the Christian life is a life of suffering. I have been a Christian for fifty years, and there has not been one year that I did not suffer. I did not expect to suffer, but still the sufferings came. In a sense, they are sent to damage us, because they damage the outward man. But they benefit our inward man. All the circumstances, the situations, the surroundings, the personal things, the family relations, the business, and the church work together for good that we may be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son (Rom. 8:28-29). We need the tribulation to press us outside of our old nature and into His nature.</p>
<p>This is why Paul gives us such an autobiography. He did not begin this book by telling us how the Lord was so merciful to him and how everything was smooth and comfortable. When someone asks how we are, we always answer, &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; But that is a lie. We are not so fine. However, the Apostle was honest. He didn&rsquo;t say that he was fine. He opens his autobiography by telling us of the tribulation he had. To experience Christ as our person, we need the tribulation. Otherwise, we are just a raw Christian. All the raw things must be cooked. The cooking is a kind of tribulation and suffering to the cooked items. Praise the Lord that we are all under the cooking!</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRESSED INTO GRACE</h2>
<p>But we should not consider this just as a kind of suffering. Suffering by itself is nothing. Its only purpose is to help us get to Christ. Suffering presses us out of ourselves and into Christ. He is our life and He is our Person. When I recall the past years, and when I look at the present situation, on one hand I feel like weeping, and on the other hand I feel like shouting praise to the Lord. Without all the sufferings, afflictions, tribulations, and pressures we could never enjoy Christ this much. The Lord told Paul, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask Me to take away your sufferings. You need them! But, I assure you, under the suffering My grace is sufficient. Without the suffering you could never taste that My grace is sufficient. You have to thank Me. It is by this suffering that you experience My all-sufficient grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no other book that tells of the sufferings of Paul as this book. There are three chapters that make a list of all his sufferings: chapters one, six, and eleven. In all of these chapters we see sufferings after sufferings, sufferings after sufferings. In 1 Corinthians, Paul talks about healings. But in 2 Corinthians, there are no healings, but sufferings. In the first book, he mentions the gifts. But in the second, there are no gifts but grace. And we know that grace is just Christ Himself, taken as our life, our person, and our enjoyment. Every one likes to have healing, but no one likes to have suffering. But if we have healing without suffering, we may have the gift but we can never experience Christ as our grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INDEX OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The person who wrote this autobiography told us how he lived. All of the sufferings and tribulations pressed him out of measure and beyond his strength. Eventually he did live by Christ. His meekness was Christ (2 Cor. 10:1). His gentleness was Christ (2 Cor. 10:1). His truth was Christ (2 Cor. 11:10). Whatever he was and did, he was and did in the person of Christ. &ldquo;For your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 2:10b). The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in this verse means in Greek the part around the eyes of the face which is the index of the inward being. So Paul lived in the index of Christ. And he said that the light of the gospel of glory is in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:4, 6). If we would see the glory of the gospel, we must see the face of Jesus. Without the face of Jesus, which means the presence of Christ, there is no glory. Paul was living in the glory of the gospel by seeing the face of Jesus. He was walking according to the index that he saw on the face of Jesus.</p>
<p>So we see that Paul was a person who not only preached and taught that Christ is our life, our person, and our everything, but he himself really practiced and lived this kind of life. Second Corinthians is really his autobiography telling us how he lived. He did not live by his natural ability, his fleshly wisdom, or merely by the so-called spiritual gifts. He lived by the grace of the Lord, which was the enjoyment of Christ Himself. Christ eventually became his person, his life, his living, his enjoyment, and his everything. So at the close of the book he says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14). This is all that we need.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST<br />
IN 2 CORINTHIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 2:10, 14-16; 3:3, 6b, 17-18; 4:6-7; 13:14</h1>
<p>In this book of 2 Corinthians there is no doctrine. But in telling us of his life, Paul did give us a hint about some of the things we have in Christ. While he is testifying of the kind of life he has in Christ, spontaneously he reveals some things about Christ to us. Therefore, the things about Christ in this book are more precious than in other books.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRMLY ATTACHED</h2>
<p>The first thing that Paul tells us is that we have been firmly attached to the anointed One. &ldquo;Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one, and hath anointed us, is God; Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest [foretaste] of the Spirit in our hearts&rdquo; (2 Cor. 1:21-22, Gk.). God has firmly attached us unto Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One. To be attached means to be put together. Christ is the anointed One, and God has firmly attached us to this Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEALED</h2>
<p>Then Paul tells us that we have been sealed by God, and He has given us the foretaste of the Spirit. God&rsquo;s anointing brings us His divine essence, and God&rsquo;s sealing impresses us with His likeness. Whenever you seal something, the likeness of the image will be impressed upon it. The foretaste of the Spirit is for our enjoyment. So we must realize Christ as God&rsquo;s anointed One. This means that He is the very realization of the Triune God. God has attached us to such a One, and He spontaneously becomes a seal upon us. We all have been sealed with the Triune God by the living Spirit.</p>
<p>Many Christians can testify that there is no need to ask certain persons if they are Christians. When you look at them, there is a seal. They bear the impression that they are in Christ. That is the likeness of the Triune God. God is expressed in their face, and that is the sealing. At the same time it is the enjoyment of God. We all have been attached to the Triune God, and He is our expression through our enjoyment of Him.</p>
<p>This is altogether related to the indwelling of Christ. The indwelling of Christ is the attaching, the sealing, and the enjoyment of the Spirit. In no other book has there been anything said about the attachment. It is only in 2 Corinthians. This means that from Paul&rsquo;s own experience he testifies that he is one who has been attached to the Triune God. He did not live by himself. He lived by the One to whom he had been attached.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Then Paul tells us that we do not need anything of the letter, which means the knowledge of the doctrine of the Scriptures. &ldquo;Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:6). We do not need the letter; we need the Spirit that gives life. Paul mentioned this in Romans 8, but it is not so clear as in 2 Corinthians 3.</p>
<p>Eventually Paul declares that today the Lord Jesus is that Spirit that gives life. &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17). The Lord Jesus today is that life-giving Spirit; He is the Spirit that gives life. In no other book is Paul so thorough and so clear in telling us that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit. There is only this one verse that tells us so strongly, so bravely, so clearly, and so emphatically that Jesus the Lord today is that Spirit that gives life.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">THE LIBERATING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After this, he says that this Spirit, who is the Lord Jesus Himself, is within us liberating us. He is liberating us from the letter of the law; from the letter of the doctrines, teachings, and knowledge, and from regulations, rituals, etc. He is the liberating Spirit. Human culture is a bondage. Religion is another bondage. Every doctrine in letter is so binding. Even knowledge can be a snare. Religion, culture, doctrine, and knowledge confine people. They may restrain them from being wild, but in another sense they bind them and kill them spiritually. But now the Lord Jesus is not only the life-giving Spirit, but also the liberating Spirit. He is within us, and wherever the Lord is, there is liberty. He is the liberating Spirit.</p>
<p>Again I say that in no other book do you have such a verse that clearly tells us that Jesus today is the liberating Spirit, liberating us from within by being our life. Most Christians think that Jesus liberates us from outside. But in this chapter, Paul tells us that the liberation Jesus affords us is from within. It is mainly not His power, but by His life. He is the life-giving Spirit, liberating us from within. The more we take Him as our life and person, the more we are liberated from all bondage.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFORMING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Paul continues by saying that the Lord Jesus is the transforming Spirit. &ldquo;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18). Doctrine, culture, religion, and knowledge can only confine us. They could never change or transform us. But the living Christ has come into us not to confine us, but to transform us, to change our life. He does this by saturating our whole being with His being. His holy, divine, spiritual, eternal, and heavenly element has not only been added into our being, but it is saturating what we are. Eventually we will be transformed into His image. That means to be transformed to what He is. And this transformation is from glory to glory. It is from one degree of glory to another. Day by day we are being transformed.</p>
<p>I have been in Los Angeles for twelve years, and there are many saints here whom I have come to know in these past years. I am so happy to say that many have become more like Christ. This is the transforming effect of the indwelling Christ. Transformation comes out of His indwelling. His indwelling implies the life giving, the liberating, and the transformation, and it also implies a kind of killing of whatever we are. His indwelling kills our natural being. This is in order that He may transform us into His being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UP AND DOWN TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>Jesus is not religion or doctrine. He is a living reality, not only in the heavens, but even more real in our being. And He is all the time moving within us. I realize that especially among the young people, the sky is always fluctuating. At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the sky was clear, but just thirty minutes later, it is cloudy. It is continually fluctuating. We would all like to be stable; if not in the third heavens, at least in the air. No one likes to be down on the earth. However, whether we are up or down does not make much difference. Jesus is still doing a work within us. I can testify concerning so many young people that I have been watching over during the past ten years. They have been up and down, up and down. But praise the Lord! They had the up and down transformation. Regardless of whether we feel we are in the third heavens or in the deep hell, Jesus is still moving within us. When we are up, He is moving. When we are down, He is moving. He never stops. His intention is to work Himself into us.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus knows our heart. He knows that we love Him. This is the thing that I treasure so much, to see so many young people loving the Lord. This is the real mercy in the church life. I never saw so many young people in other Christian groups loving the Lord. This is a great grace upon us. As long as we love the Lord, His intention is to work Himself into us. Whether we feel we are up or down, makes no difference. When we are up, He is working. When we are down, He is still working.</p>
 <p>I believe that many of us are disappointed when we lose our temper. I don&rsquo;t encourage you to lose your temper, but neither would I advise you not to lose it. Whether I tell you not to lose your temper or to go ahead and lose it makes no difference. When you lose your temper, you will just lose it. I cannot help you, and the Lord Jesus wouldn&rsquo;t help you either. This is because He knows, when we lose our temper, He is able to work more within us. Many times Christ has been wrought into our being through the losing of our temper more than through other things. But don&rsquo;t think that I am encouraging you to lose your temper.</p>
<p>When I was a young man, for a long period of time I was nice to everybody. But I can testify that through that long period Christ was not wrought so deeply into me. Then the Lord took my goodness away. I would praise the Lord in the morning, but I would lose my temper with my wife at noon. Then I would be down. I just couldn&rsquo;t live. I would say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, forgive me. I lost my temper.&rdquo; Later I realized that when I was down to that extent, Christ was wrought into me much more.</p>
<p>As long as you love the Lord Jesus, I can assure you that you will be the elevator going up and down, up and down. But praise the Lord! It is through this kind of experiences that Christ is wrought into us. This is especially true in the first stage of our Christian life. To lose our temper affords much opportunity for Christ to be wrought into us.</p>
<p>This is the work of the indwelling Christ to work Himself into us that we may be transformed into His image. It is not merely by studying, reading the Bible, or praying. Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t do these things. But many times Christ has to be wrought into us through our failure. Our failure affords a good opportunity to the Lord that He may work Himself into us. Of course we should not try to lose our temper. That is a kind of performance. But as we are loving the Lord Jesus in our up and down situation, He is working within us as the life-giving Spirit. He is working by His indwelling to transform us. This is His main work today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TREASURE OF HIS FACE</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians also gives us another extraordinary verse. &ldquo;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:7). There is not such a verse in any other book. Paul tells us that we are the vessels, and the Lord Jesus within us is the treasure. But the key to this verse is the verse preceding it: &ldquo;to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:6). In Greek, the word for &ldquo;face&rdquo; is the same word used for &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 2:10, which means the index around the eyes. This means that if we don&rsquo;t have the index of Jesus&rsquo; face, He can never be a treasure to us. We will never sense that we have a treasure within until we see the face of Jesus. When we are enjoying His presence, we sense that He is such a precious treasure within us.</p>
<p>This can never be just a kind of saying. We all can say that we are the earthen vessel, and Jesus is the treasure within. But we can say this without any sense of the reality within us. It is only when we are living in His presence, looking at the index of His being, that we will sense that He is such a treasure to us. In the whole universe, there is nothing so precious as to behold the face of Jesus. This is something of personal experience and enjoyment. The more we live in His presence, the more sense we will have of the preciousness of Jesus. This is just the enjoyment of His indwelling. This very Jesus indwells us. This is a living reality, not merely a saying.</p>
<p>If we would all learn to forsake our old person, taking Him as our person by looking at the index of His face while enjoying His presence, we would have a sweet sense of the preciousness of the indwelling Jesus. This would make us so shining, a shining which is the reflecting of His glory. I can assure you that if you ever have this kind of experience, others will see how shining you are. It is not that you are merely happy, but you are shining. Something from within shines out, and that is the reflection of Jesus. This was Paul&rsquo;s experience of the indwelling Christ.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">CAPTIVES OF JESUS</h2>
<p>Paul also tells us that we are the defeated captives of Jesus. &ldquo;Now thanks be unto God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other the savor of life unto life&rdquo; (2 Cor. 2:14-16). God today leads us in triumph in Christ. This phrase is difficult to translate. It pictures a general who fought the battle and gained the victory, capturing many captives. Then he returns triumphantly to celebrate his victory, with a parade of all the captives behind him. Today, Christ has gained the victory, and He has captured so many captives, including you and me. The procession is still going on in the universe. Hallelujah! We all have been put into this procession. God will lead us in the triumph of Christ.</p>
<p>However, to be captured means that we must be defeated, conquered and subdued by Jesus. It is so good to be defeated by Jesus. Undoubtedly, in the eyes of our unbelieving relatives and friends, we are just a captive to Jesus. To their sense, we have just been captured. Praise the Lord, we have been captured! Jesus defeated us, conquered us, subdued us, and captured us. So now we are so dependent upon Him. We take Him as everything to us. This is the procession of His triumph. We have nothing to say and nothing to do. We are fully captured by Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SWEET SAVOR OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the ancient times, while such a procession and celebration were going on, certain ones would scatter incense before the procession. This is what Paul means when he says that we are a sweet savor of Christ. We are defeated, conquered, subdued, and captured and now we bear the incense. The real gospel preaching is the scattering of the incense. And the sweet savor of this incense is life to some and death to others. Praise the Lord that we are in such a procession to celebrate the triumph of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>By looking into all of these points, we can see what we should be. We should be the ones attached to the Triune God, within whom Jesus is working all the time, transforming us into His image. And we should be the earthen vessels to contain Him with His living face as the treasure. Then we will be the captives in His triumphant procession, celebrating His victory in the whole universe.</p>
<p>We can see that all these items are completely different from the teachings and doctrines which we received in a traditional way. This is because these are items of Jesus&rsquo; indwelling. The indwelling Christ will do all these things, making these items so real, so living, and so practical in our daily life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is not just to recover the oneness and the church&rsquo;s testimony, but to recover the real content of the church life. The content of the church life is just all these items of the indwelling Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SWEET CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>This is why the church life is altogether different from what we saw and experienced in Christianity. It is in another category completely. And this is why the church life is so sweet to us. The indwelling Christ is working within all the brothers and sisters within the church. If we did not have the indwelling Christ, we would all go our own way. We love all the brothers and sisters because Jesus is living and working within them. In the church life every member is so precious, and we do love one another. It is not that we are so lovable; it is because of the treasure indwelling us. Of course, we are human, and some times we do have problems with one another. But how good it is when we turn back to the indwelling Jesus. Then we say, &ldquo;Brother, forgive me, I was wrong. Let&rsquo;s turn to the Lord together.&rdquo; And when we touch the Lord together, everyone becomes so lovable. It is not what we are; it is the sweet Jesus that indwells us.</p>
<p>Religion can confine us, but it can never give us a sweet savor. Religion simply does not smell sweet. But Jesus is the very incense scattered among His captives. It is hard to explain the difference in the church. Others sing hymns, they have the Bible, they have one another, and they have their speaker. What is the difference? It is just the sweet Jesus. This is why we have had the burden to share these messages on the indwelling Christ. It is to strengthen, enrich, and uplift the church life. The more we practice the indwelling Christ, the more Christ becomes so precious to us.</p>
<p>If we do not learn to enjoy the indwelling Christ, there is no incense in the church life. He is not sweet if we study Him in an objective way. We cannot smell Him, and we cannot sense Him. But He is so sweet subjectively. When we learn to enjoy Him from within, we scatter the sweet savor to others. This sweet smell is just something of the sweet nature and essence of Jesus Himself.</p>
<p>There is no other book like 2 Corinthians. Paul covers all of these precious items in his autobiography because merely in teaching no one can utter such things. This is simply his experience, and he testifies to that effect. Finally he says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14). This is the church life by the indwelling Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN GALATIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:4, 13-14, 15a, 16a; 2:20a; 3:24, 27, 28; 4:19; 5:2, 4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGION</h2>
<p>We have seen that in the book of 2 Corinthians, Paul gives us a record of his life, showing us how he experienced the indwelling Christ. After this, in the book of Galatians, he still is speaking about the indwelling Christ, but with a specific aspect. This is the matter of religion. We all must realize that religion is mostly composed of four things: teachings or doctrines, regulations, traditions, and ordinances. In any religion, there are the teachings, the regulations, the traditions, and ordinances or rituals. All of these four things are covered in the book of Galatians.</p>
<p>We also see that in the book of Galatians the law is thoroughly and absolutely dealt with. There are some similar aspects in the books of Romans and Galatians, but Romans does not mention the law as much as Galatians. Paul shows us in Galatians that if we use the law in a wrong way, it becomes an entanglement to us in enjoying Christ. Therefore, the law in this book is fully dealt with in a negative way.</p>
<p>Paul tells us that he was one of the foremost ones in the Jewish religion. As such, he opposed Christ and persecuted the church, while at the same time he kept all the traditions of his forefathers. Hence, we see the religion, the teachings, the law, and the traditions. He also mentions the matter of circumcision two or three times. This is a kind of ordinance. Moreover, he was concerned about them keeping the days, months, seasons, and years. This is all a matter of ordinances. Therefore, we can see in this short book how religion, which includes the teachings, the law, the traditions, and the ordinances, is opposed to the indwelling Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h2>
<p>Paul opens the book of Galatians by calling such a religion the present evil age. &ldquo;Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of God and our Father&rdquo; (Gal. 1:4). Every book in the Bible opens in its own specific way. Paul opens Galatians by saying that Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to deliver us from this present evil age. He did not say that Christ gave Himself to deliver us from hell. In a general sense, all Christians usually consider that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from hell. But here Paul says that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age. This was the age in which Paul was living.</p>
<p>Many Bible translators translate the Greek word for age into world, because an age is a part or period of the whole world. All the ages added together equal the world. During the time of the Apostle Paul, there was a certain age. If you have ever read the world history of that period of time, you could see that that age had three aspects: Greek philosophy, Roman politics, and the Hebrew religion. The Greeks brought in the philosophy, the wisdom, and the knowledge. The Romans brought in the way to govern and organize a strong administration. Then the Hebrews had the best religion.</p>
<p>Now we can see that what Paul means when he speaks of the present evil age is the Hebrew religion. As far as he was concerned, he was not in Greek philosophy or Roman politics. But he was very much in the Hebrew religion. And his subject in this book is not in the sphere of philosophy or politics. It is fully related to God. Therefore, we must realize that religion is part of the world. Most Christians do not know what Paul meant when he said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age. They all interpreted this word to mean the world in a general way. But this is not the Greek word <em>kosmos.</em> It is the word for age. It is not the world in a general way, but the age in which Paul lived. And of course this had to be the religious world of the Hebrew religion. In Galatians 6:13-15 the Apostle Paul also made it very clear that circumcision, the religious ordinance, was something of the world to which Paul was crucified.</p>
<p>Also, at the time when Paul wrote this letter to the Galatian churches (Galatia was a province of the Roman empire), the saints in those churches had become ensnared in a kind of religion. This means that they had been caught by the present evil age. This is why the Apostle Paul wrote this letter. All the believers in Galatia had been caught in a religious realm which at that time was the present evil age.</p><h2 class="head1">WITHOUT CHRIST</h2>
<p>It is very meaningful that this letter follows 2 Corinthians. This means that if we would be a person like Paul, living by Christ and taking Him as our person, we must be aware of religion. Whenever we become religious, we become ensnared in the present evil age. If we look at today&rsquo;s Christians, we can see that so many of them are simply in a kind of religion. They have the teachings, the regulations, the traditions, and the ordinances. In the past I have mentioned several times what a religion is. A religion is the act of doing things for God without the presence of Christ. If we worship God without the presence of Christ, that is a religion. If we work for God without the presence of Christ, that is a religion. If we try to be a good person without the presence of Christ, that is a religion. Anything for God without the presence of Christ is a religion. Religion is simply to worship God, to work for God, to keep the law, and to improve ourselves and do so many good things religiously without the presence of Christ. It may be good, but it is still a religion because it is without Christ.</p>
<p>The Jewish religion never taught anyone to worship idols, to commit sin against God, or to be evil. Rather it always taught others to worship God sincerely, to serve God faithfully, and to behave honestly. Surely this is good. But this is what the Apostle Paul called religion. He was the foremost in such a religion, keeping the law, keeping his forefathers&rsquo; tradition, and observing all the ordinances. But if we would enjoy the indwelling Christ, we must beware of all these religious things. This is why Paul said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age. There is no doubt that the present evil age of the Apostle Paul was the typical Jewish religion, a religion supposedly founded according to the verses of the Bible. Therefore, if we would realize the real experience and enjoyment of the indwelling Christ, we must beware of anything religious.</p>
<p>Of course, I realize that this word does not sound well to religious ears. But if we read our Bible in Galatians, we can see that religion is not a positive word. Religion persecuted the church. Religion damaged the church. Religion opposed Christ. This is why we need to be delivered from all the religious teachings, all the regulations, all the traditions, and all the ordinances. This is what it means to be delivered from the present evil age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST REVEALED IN US</h2>
<p>Paul told us that he was exceedingly zealous in his forefathers&rsquo; religion. &ldquo;For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews&rsquo; religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: and profited in the Jews&rsquo; religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers&rdquo; (Gal. 1:13-14). But then something happened to Paul, and he expresses it in this way: &ldquo;But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me&rdquo; (Gal. 1:15a, 16a). When Christ is revealed in us, all the religious matters simply fall off. Paul was so zealous for his religion, but on the way to Damascus a voice came from the heavens and smote him to the earth. He was blinded. Actually he was already religiously blind, but he didn&rsquo;t know it. Now his blindness became exposed.</p>
<p>This is the case of so many dear ones. They thought they were clear, but they did not realize that they were religiously blinded. Then one day the Lord touched them and exposed their blindness. Paul had been so clear. He knew where to go, and he took the lead to take others there, but now he needed someone to lead him. He did not know where to go. He was made blind by Christ. But, praise the Lord, this blindness eventually became a real vision. Paul became blind to religion, yet he became clear with a vision concerning Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST LIVING IN US</h2>
<p>From that time, Paul began to see Christ. It had pleased God to reveal Christ into him, and he was delivered from religion. This is why he said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age. Now he is writing that the Galatians might obtain the same deliverance. They had been trapped in a snare of religion, and needed deliverance from religion. Now it is not a matter of keeping the traditions, but of having Christ revealed in us. And it is not a matter of keeping the law, but of having Christ living in us. &ldquo;I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). Christ should not only be revealed in us, but also live in us. Christ has to be both our life and our living.</p><h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>Paul made it clear to the Galatians that there should be no more religion, no more law, no more regulations, no more traditions, and no more ordinances. They have not been baptized into religion, but into Christ (Gal. 3:27). And as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. It is all a matter of Christ. It is not a matter of keeping the days, months, seasons, and years. That is religion, that is not Christ.</p>
<p>Where are we today? Are we in the realm of religion, or are we in Christ? I have to tell you the truth that very few Christians know the difference between religion and Christ. In a sense, all parents like their children to be religious. They neglect to see their children care for Christ. They would rather see them so formal, regulated, fundamental, and scriptural. If this is the case, then the book of Galatians was written for them. Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to deliver us from religion. This is the message of this book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANOTHER PERSON</h2>
<p>We all must be delivered from being religious. Suppose we come to the meeting so quietly and piously, yet the Christ within wants to shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; Would we shout with Him? We like to be so quiet, but the indwelling Christ wants to be released. Otherwise, we simply become a cage to Him.</p>
<p>The problem is that we are a religious person, but the indwelling Christ wants to be another person in us. For Christ to be our life, we must learn to take Him as our person. To do this we must learn to forget about everything. We have to forget about being religious and good. God had no intention to give us a religion. God&rsquo;s intention was to use the law as a child conductor to bring us to Christ. &ldquo;Wherefore the law was our child conductor [Greek] to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith&rdquo; (Gal. 3:24). In ancient times among the Jews, the parents sent their children to the teachers with a servant as a conductor. Paul used this as an illustration to show us that God used the law as a child conductor to bring us to Christ. But the problem is that the Jewish people would not care for Christ. They stayed with the conductor.</p>
<p>Today, the principle is the same. So many so-called Christians don&rsquo;t care for Christ. They care for many religious traditions and ordinances. Now the Lord in His recovery is bringing us back to the beginning. That is, He is bringing us back to Himself as the pure Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>Christ firstly is revealed into us, and then He begins to live in us. Thirdly He must be formed in us. &ldquo;My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you&rdquo; (Gal. 4:19). A mother&rsquo;s pregnancy is a good illustration of this. At the start of a pregnancy, what is within the mother has no form. But after nine months, the pregnancy is fully formed into a human image. Christ is in us; we are all so clear about this. But the problem is that He has not been formed in us. To have Christ formed in us, we must take Him as our person. Then He will saturate every part of our being with Himself. This means that we must stop our thinking, our choosing, our loving, and our likes and dislikes. But we do not stop just to stop. We stop in order to turn to the indwelling Christ that He may be all of these things within us. If we will do this, gradually, bit by bit, the indwelling Christ will saturate our being in a fine way. Eventually, He will take over our whole being. This means that He will be formed in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVERED FROM THE PROFIT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>By the time that Paul gets to chapter five, he tells us that if we are still religious, Christ will profit us nothing. &ldquo;Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing&rdquo; (Gal. 5:2). And not only that, but if we continue to be religious, we are severed, cut off from Christ. &ldquo;Ye are severed [Greek] from Christ, whosoever of you are justified by the law&rdquo; (Gal. 5:4).</p>
<p>What does it mean to be severed from Christ? We may use today&rsquo;s electrical terms as an illustration. To be severed means to be insulated. Electricity may be installed in a building, but if we don&rsquo;t apply the switch, we are insulated and cut off from the flow of electricity. Christ is installed within us, but we must go to the switch. We must turn to our spirit to switch Him on. As long as we stay in our mind, we are insulated from Christ. Christ is within us, but He does not profit us because we are insulated from Him. Darby&rsquo;s translation says, &ldquo;Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ.&rdquo; What deprives us from the profit of Christ? It is simply religion.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we have Christ within us, if we still live by our wisdom, our thinking, our emotion, this means that the religious snare has deprived us of all the benefits of the indwelling Christ. This is why Paul calls religion the present evil age. It is evil because it keeps me away from Christ. God has chosen me and called me to be baptized into Christ. God has attached me to the Anointed One. But the subtle, religious snare has deprived me of all the benefits of the indwelling Christ. This is really the evil age, the age that keeps people away from the real enjoyment of the indwelling Christ. But, praise the Lord, Christ gave Himself in order to deliver us from religion! Now He is bringing us back to Himself and is delivering us from this present evil age.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN GALATIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 3:2-3, 5a, 14; 4:6; 5:5, 16, 24-25; 6:1a, 8, 15, 18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FROM CHRIST TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We have seen from the last message that Galatians is a book on the indwelling Christ. In the first part of the book, Paul speaks much about Christ. But from the middle of the book, he begins to speak about the Spirit. By reading this book carefully, we see that whatever has been accomplished on the cross, and all that the Lord has obtained and attained, is mentioned as the work of Christ. But when Christ is experienced by us, Paul changes from Christ to the Spirit. When Paul speaks about the objective work of the Lord, he speaks of the work of Christ. But when he speaks of experiencing the subjective Christ, he speaks of the Spirit. This shows that we should not consider Christ and the Spirit as two separate beings. Christ and the Spirit are one all-inclusive divine being. When we speak of His work on the cross, His accomplishment of redemption, His resurrection, and our being baptized into Him, we speak of Christ. But when we go on to speak of the practical experiences of Christ, we change from Christ to the Spirit. Christ is the One who has accomplished everything for us, and the Spirit is the One we are now experiencing. This is why in the book of Galatians Paul first mentions Christ, but then speaks of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROMISED BLESSING</h2>
<p>The blessing of God promised to Abraham was the Spirit. &ldquo;That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith&rdquo; (Gal. 3:14). The Jewish people thought and still think that God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham was something material. But actually, God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham was simply to give Himself to His chosen ones. God has no intention to give us anything but Himself. Paul said in Philippians 3:8 that everything besides Christ is dung. This means a kind of garbage or refuse. If God would give us anything but Christ, we would be cheated. This is why God, in the process of giving Himself, becomes Christ. And when this Christ is realized by us in an experiential way, He is the Spirit.</p>
<p>What is a real blessing? To go to heaven is not the real blessing. Even heaven, were it empty of God, would be vain. Some consider a good wife or a good husband as a blessing. It may be a temporary blessing, but consider how much trouble your husband or wife has brought you. It is altogether a mixture. Trouble always mingles with blessing. Others expect their children to be a blessing. In a sense there is some blessing, but with much trouble.</p>
<p>What I mean is this. Our marriage, our family, our degree, our wealth, our fame, our health, and many other things could never be a real blessing to us. The real blessing is just God Himself. And how could God be given to us? How could He be realized and experienced by us as our daily enjoyment? There is no other way but by His being the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have mentioned before how God had to be processed in order to dispense Himself into us as our enjoyment and experience. The Spirit we are experiencing today is just the processed God. Christ is the very God within the process, and the Spirit is the very God who has been processed to become our experience. In eternity past, He was merely God, but when He came into the process, He became flesh (John 1:1, 14) who is Christ in the flesh. Christ is God in the process. After the process, He becomes our experience as the processed God, who is the very Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Today we not only have God and Christ, but also the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the processed God as our experience and realization.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>So in the book of Galatians, Paul first mentions Christ, and then the Spirit. The Spirit was first of all promised. God promised the blessing of the Spirit to Abraham. This promised Spirit is now being ministered as a fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise. &ldquo;He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit....&rdquo; (Gal. 3:5). Paul said that he ministered the Spirit to the Galatian believers. All ministry must be a ministry that ministers the Spirit to others. Regardless of how much is said in meetings, if nothing of the Spirit is ministered into people, the meetings are altogether vain. We have all had the experience, after attending many church meetings and conferences, of coming home and finding it difficult to remember what has been said. Yet regardless of how little we remember what was spoken, still something is within us. We can forget about the teachings, but we cannot forget the Spirit that has been ministered into us. On the other hand, we have also gone to a kind of service where a good speaker gave an eloquent sermon, yet when we came home, there was nothing left within us. When we come to a meeting that ministers the Spirit to us, we may forget what we have heard doctrinally, yet we still have something within us&mdash;it is the processed God as the Spirit that has been ministered into us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECEIVING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Spirit was promised, the Spirit is now being ministered, and the Spirit must be received. &ldquo;This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&rdquo; (Gal. 3:2), The Spirit is ministered to us, and we must learn to receive. How can we receive? First of all we must open ourselves. We should not keep ourselves closed. When we are in a meeting listening to some kind of ministry, we must say, &ldquo;Lord, keep me open to You. I want to receive the ministry of the Spirit.&rdquo; Forty years ago I used to sit and listen to Brother Watchman Nee quite often. If I did not look to the Lord to keep me open, I might hear the message, yet I would not get much of the Lord inside me. So we must all keep ourselves open to receive the Spirit.</p>
<p>While we are listening and opening ourselves to the Lord, we must continually say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in our spirit. This is the way to receive the Spirit. We must open ourselves and say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to His Word. When we open ourselves and say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the Word, the Word which is outside of us gets into our spirit and becomes the Spirit. Then when we express something of the Spirit to others, it becomes the Word again. If they will amen the Word, it will get into them and become the Spirit again. This is the way to receive the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEGINNING AND WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After receiving the Spirit, we must begin in the Spirit. &ldquo;Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh?&rdquo; (Gal. 3:3). We all must begin in the Spirit and continue in the Spirit. When we begin in the Spirit, it means that we are starting to walk in the spirit, we are beginning to live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, after beginning in the Spirit, we must learn to walk in spirit. &ldquo;This I say then, Walk in the Spirit [lit., in spirit], and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh&rdquo; (Gal. 5:16). The word &ldquo;walk&rdquo; in Greek means to have our being in this way. Whatever we say, whatever we do, whatever we are, and wherever we are, are all included in this one word. So to walk in spirit means to have our being in spirit. This means that all the time we must live by Christ and take Him as our person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOW TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In this short book, there are so many items about the subjective Spirit. After walking in spirit, we must learn to sow to the Spirit. Then we shall reap of the Spirit. &ldquo;For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life eternal&rdquo; (Gal. 6:8). This simply means that whatever we intend to do must be one with the Spirit. To sow to the Spirit means to have Christ as the seed. Then we will reap a harvest of Christ. Christ first of all is the seed to us, and eventually He becomes our very harvest. This is not the doctrinal Christ, but the Christ in our experience. He is our seed, and He is our harvest. If we are daily sowing the Spirit as the seed, surely some day we will reap something of the Spirit as our harvest. But if we sow to the flesh, we will reap a harvest of the flesh. Therefore whatever we do must be the seed of the Spirit. Then, spontaneously, something will grow up out of what we have sown. This is the indwelling Christ experienced as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>By reading the book of Galatians properly, we see clearly that the proper Christian life is nothing but a daily walk in Christ. And today this Christ is the very Spirit within us for our experience. So this book begins with deliverance from this present evil age, and it ends with this: &ldquo;Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen&rdquo; (Gal. 6:18).</p>
<p>Are we living in this present evil age, or are we living in our spirit? Are we living in religion, or are we walking in spirit? To walk in spirit means to walk in our spirit. It is in our spirit that we have the enjoyment of the Lord. This is why this verse says that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is with our spirit. When we get into our spirit, we enjoy the Lord as grace. When we begin to quarrel with our wife or husband, we must run back to the spirit. The more we stay in our mind, the more we will exchange words. But when we get into our spirit, we touch the grace of the Lord. Grace is the Lord experienced by us. The experienced Christ becomes our grace. Here we could never exchange words, because we are in another country. The mind is a quarreling country, but the spirit is a country of grace. It is not a matter of trying to overcome, it is a matter of being in the right country. The right country is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Paul begins the book of Galatians by speaking about Christ. Then he changes to the Spirit. Eventually, he tells us that the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, is in our spirit. Therefore, we must learn to stay in our spirit. In order to do this we need some exercise. By our natural birth and life, we live not in our spirit, but in our mind. But now we must change countries. We must learn continually to return to the country of grace which is our spirit.</p>
<p>Very few Christians today know that Christ is in their spirit. Hardly anyone has ever paid any attention to the last verse of Galatians: &ldquo;Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo; Satan is so subtle. Whenever anyone comes to this verse, he covers the last three words, &ldquo;with your spirit.&rdquo; The satanic hand hid these three words from me for many years. I expounded this book verse by verse to others, but I never expounded the last three words. But the whole book of Galatians is contained in these three words. We can have all the electrical wires installed into a building, yet if we don&rsquo;t have a switch, we cannot apply the electricity. This is the satanic deceit. These three words are the switch. Without them, how and where shall we touch Christ? Oh, how evil Satan is! He has hidden the switch from God&rsquo;s children. But today we know where the switch is. Hallelujah! Christ is the very God in process, and eventually the processed God is Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. In our spirit we enjoy the indwelling Christ as our grace. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is <em>with our spirit</em>!</p>
<p>What is the grace? Grace is simply Christ Himself as our enjoyment. When we come back to our spirit, there is just the sweet enjoyment of Christ. Christ is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit. When we turn to our spirit, we simply enjoy Him as our grace. When we are living in our mind, we are living in a backward country. We should not stay there, but turn to the wonderful country of our spirit. This country is not backward, but full of grace. Here we have Christ as our full enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head1">RELIGION OR THE SPIRIT?</h2>
<p>The book of Galatians starts negatively with the evil age of religion, and it closes positively with the human spirit. We were formerly in the country of religion, but now we must remain in the new country of our spirit. We have been delivered out of religion, which was mostly in our mind, to the wonderful enjoyment of Christ in our spirit. Religion has the doctrines, the regulations, the traditions, and the ordinances. But in our spirit we have the living Spirit as the reality of Christ. This is why, when a person stays in his spirit enjoying Christ as grace, he is in another country. He was in the mind, but now he is in his spirit. He was in religion, but now he is enjoying Christ as his grace.</p>
<p>The book of Galatians clearly mentions these two countries of religion and our spirit. We may also call them two realms or two kinds of worlds. From the beginning of the Bible we can see these two sources in the garden. There were two trees: the tree of life, indicating God, and the tree of knowledge, signifying Satan. We all know that religion came out of knowledge. It is an invention of the fallen mind. Knowledge is in our mind. In Genesis 3, Satan got into the mind of man. This means that the tree of knowledge got into fallen man. Later in Genesis we can see that many inventions came out of the fallen mind with the tree of knowledge. The main invention that issued out of the fallen mind is religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORLD OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>Some may think that it is too much to say that the present evil age in Galatians 1:4 is religion. But if we understand this book according to the context, we see that the book itself defines this present evil age as religion. The world in this book is religion. Galatians 6:12-13 speaks clearly about circumcision, which is something religious. Then verse 14 says, &ldquo;But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.&rdquo; Many Christians quote this verse, but they have never realized that this verse is a continuation of the previous two verses. Since the foregoing verses speak about religion, it is clear by the context that the world in verse 14 is religion. Then verse 15 continues, &ldquo;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the context of these verses, it is clear that in the book of Galatians both the present evil age and the world mean religion. Religion to the Apostle Paul and to the early Christians was a strong world. Therefore, they had to be delivered from that evil age. It is the same today. Consider the Roman Catholic Church. It is very religious, yet it is so evil. It is an evil, religious world. Many people need to be delivered from that evil religion, that evil world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOST EVIL THING</h2>
<p>The most evil thing, according to Galatians, is to distract people from Christ. God&rsquo;s will is to reveal Christ into us, to have Christ live in us, and to have Christ formed in us. This is God&rsquo;s purpose. Yet religion is something that distracts people from this purpose. To human eyes it does not appear so evil, but to God&rsquo;s eyes it is the most evil thing. God&rsquo;s intention is to work Christ into us, but Satan&rsquo;s subtlety is to use religion to keep us away from Christ. It appears good and cultured, yet religion severs more people from Christ than anything else.</p>
<p>To visit the casinos in Las Vegas is undoubtedly to be severed from Christ. But to be religious is considered as approved and commendable behavior. Yet Paul says in Galatians 5 that to be religious is to be severed from Christ, to be fallen from grace. If we have God&rsquo;s point of view, we will see that anything that severs people from Christ is evil. Even the most moral, ethical, and religious things are evil in the eyes of God, because they sever us from the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>Paul even tells us in this book that a certain kind of preaching is evil. &ldquo;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed&rdquo; (Gal. 1:8). This is not gambling, this is preaching. Even the preaching of a certain kind of gospel is cursed in the eyes of God as a part of the present evil age. This is a part of the world to which Paul was crucified. Paul had nothing to do with this kind of preaching, because now he had Christ revealed in him, living in him, and being formed in him. He only cared for the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that His grace is with our spirit! If we stay in our mind, surely we will be religious, but when we turn to our spirit there is the rich enjoyment of Christ as grace. The tree of life is in our spirit, and the tree of knowledge is in our mind. This is the indwelling Christ in Galatians. He is now dwelling in our spirit to be our enjoyable grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN EPHESIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:8b, 10-11, 16-17a, 19b; 1:13b-14; 4:30; 5:18b; 6:17-18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Almost everyone knows that the subject of Ephesians is the Body of Christ. How does the Body of Christ come into being? We may say that it comes out of Christ. But Paul did not say it in such a brief way. He says that the church comes into being out of the unsearchable riches of Christ. &ldquo;That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8b). The source from which the Body of Christ comes into existence is the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEART</h2>
<p>How then can we realize, experience, and enjoy all of the riches of Christ? Paul tells us clearly that our inner man must be strengthened. &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may make His home in your hearts by faith&rdquo; (Eph. 3:16-17a). Our inner man must be strengthened not by any knowledge, but by the Spirit. And this is according to the riches of God&rsquo;s glory. The issue is that Christ may make His home in our heart. Many Christian teachers have written volumes on the book of Ephesians, but most have not seen that the central point is Christ making His home in our heart. Have you ever read a book that says the key point in Ephesians is the indwelling Christ making His home in our heart? So many Christians today talk about the Body of Christ, but we know that any body without the life of a person is a corpse. A corpse is short not only of life, but of a living person. The difference between a tree and a man is that a tree has only life, but a man has life plus a person. A body is a vessel that contains a living person. People talk about the Body of Christ, but where is the living person of Christ? He must be making His home in our hearts; otherwise, the &ldquo;church&rdquo; which is supposed to be the Body of Christ is only a corpse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FROM CENTER TO CIRCUMFERENCE</h2>
<p>How we praise the Lord that today Christ is the life-giving Spirit, living in us! And He is going to make His home in us. We all must come back to the pure Word. Christ not only lives in us, but He also must make His home in our heart. This is not something general, but so specific. In the past we have pointed out, according to the New Testament, that our heart is bigger than our spirit. Our heart is the circumference, and our spirit is the center. Christ as the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit as the center, and from the center He is spreading Himself into all the parts of our heart.</p>
<p>It is wonderful that we can say that Christ is in us, but we may only have Christ at the center, in our spirit. There may not be any spreading of Christ into our heart. This is why Paul prayed for the believers that their inner man might be strengthened. Our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit is our inner man. Our inner man needs to be strengthened and made strong; then Christ will be able to make His home in our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STRONG IN TALKING, WEAK IN PRAYING</h2>
<p>Most Christians, even those who love the Lord, are not strong in their spirit. They are strong in talking, but if you ask them to pray, they are silent. The best way to silence others is to ask for a time of prayer. When the time of prayer is over, however, everyone begins to talk. This means that they are strong in their mind, but weak in their spirit, which is their inner man. When we are living in the presence of the Lord, we don&rsquo;t like to talk so much. Rather, we would prefer to pray and to praise. We are strong in our spirit.</p>
<p>Hence, the Apostle Paul prayed for us that our inner man might be made strong. The result, then, is that Christ will spread within our heart. For Christ to make His home in our heart means that He will saturate and permeate every part of our heart with Himself. Then our whole being will be a home to Him, and He will be the dweller. He will not only be our life, but the living person who is the dweller of our being.</p><h2 class="head1">HITTING THE MARK</h2>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s economy, the Body of Christ must have a living person who is so real, practical, living, and available. This is why God&rsquo;s intention is that Christ make His home in us. It is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong; it is a matter of having Christ as a living person spreading into our whole being. We should not try to be right, but rather practice taking Christ as our person. If He is making His home in our heart, then we are hitting the mark. The problem is that we try to be so right, yet we do not have Christ making His home in our heart. Therefore we must see that the central point in Ephesians is Christ making His home in our heart. This is the way we can participate in all the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>What a salvation we have in that we can live by another person! The unbelievers do not have another person; they only have themselves. We have someone else, and our person can be replaced by Him. It is altogether not a matter of religion, but of a living person making His home in our heart. I can testify that I have experienced the riches of Christ in these past years. I have been enjoying Christ in a rich way. When we turn to our spirit and take Him as our Person, we simply enjoy His riches. And it is by enjoying His riches that He makes His home in us. The practical experience of the indwelling Christ is to let Him make His home in our heart. It is not my doing, it is not my behaving, it is altogether my letting Him make His home in me. All day long we must learn to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I take You as my person.&rdquo; Then He will take over every part of our being, and our heart will become His home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians also tells us that after we were saved, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit. &ldquo;In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest [foretaste] of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory&rdquo; (Eph. 1:13b-14). Many people ask whether we have received the Spirit or not. But this is just talk. We have the facts. Ephesians 1:13 tells us affirmatively that after we believed, we were sealed. God put a seal in us, and this seal is just Himself in His last Person. The Spirit is the last Person of the Triune God. When we believed in Jesus Christ, at that very moment, God put the Holy Spirit into us as a seal. This seal gives us the impression and the image of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORETASTE OF OUR INHERITANCE</h2>
<p>But this is not all. This sealing Spirit is also the foretaste of our inheritance. What then is our inheritance? It is altogether God Himself. We are going to inherit God Himself. Some people would like to inherit heaven, but I don&rsquo;t want that. Heaven is not a person. Praise the Lord that we are going to inherit God. God is our inheritance. The Spirit that seals us is a foretaste today of our inheritance. It is an earnest, a guarantee to certify that we are going to obtain that inheritance. Praise the Lord for such a foretaste!</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRIEVE NOT THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Then Ephesians 4:30 says, &ldquo;And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.&rdquo; Because we are sealed with the Spirit, He is so near to us. It is easy to grieve someone who is close to us. If I am a hundred miles from you, I could never grieve you. But if I am your roommate, I will grieve you every day. The sealing, the indwelling Spirit is so close to us; so it is easy to grieve Him. Therefore, Paul tells us not to grieve the Spirit.</p>
 <p>If the Holy Spirit were far from us, we could never grieve Him. But, praise the Lord, He is within us. When we are not happy, enjoying the Lord, it means that He is grieved. So we must turn to the Lord in our spirit, taking Him as our person, and letting Him make His home in our heart. Then we will not grieve the Spirit. Anything that keeps us from the enjoyment of the Lord, grieves the Spirit. Whenever we are not joyful and praising the Lord, we can be sure that the Spirit is grieved. This is the guideline of the Christian walk. All Christians should be joyful. They should be happy. We should not have a long face, but a wide face. Whenever we have a long face, we must realize that we have grieved the Spirit. We must learn to enjoy the Lord by taking Him as our person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FILLED IN SPIRIT BY PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Paul also tells us in Ephesians that we should be filled in spirit. &ldquo;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 5:18). This is related to the matter of grieving the Spirit. If we are filled in our spirit with the fullness of the Lord, surely we will not grieve the Spirit.</p>
<p>To help us to be filled in spirit, we need to pray-read the Word. This is seen in Ephesians 6:17-18, according to the following translation: &ldquo;And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit&rdquo; (literal Greek translation). Paul tells us to take the Word of God by means of all prayer. We must learn to pray with the Word, pray over the Word, and pray about the Word. This is what it means to pray-read. If we pray-read the Word wherever we are, we will be filled in spirit. Whether we pray-read loudly on the freeway or silently at work makes no difference. We must learn to take the Word by means of all prayer. It is so simple, so easy, and so satisfying. Just pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, keep me from grieving the Spirit. Thank You, Lord, that I have been sealed with the Spirit, and the Spirit is the foretaste of my inheritance of You. So keep me filled in spirit with Your fullness.&rdquo; If we would pray-read the Word in this way, we would be so joyous and happy, and we would be filled in our spirit with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>These few things are the main points in the book of Ephesians. We must let Christ make His home in our heart. We must keep from grieving the Spirit. And we must be filled in our spirit with Christ by pray-reading the living Word. Then we will enjoy all of the unsearchable riches of Christ, which will produce the Body of Christ, the real church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN EPHESIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:17, 22-23; 2:15-16, 18-22; 4:3-4, 15-16, 23-24; 5:29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE REAL BODY-LIFE</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians shows us clearly that the church is the Body of Christ. And we have seen that this Body comes out of the enjoyment of all the unsearchable riches of Christ. Most Christians have seen the fact that the church is the Body of Christ. So many Christian teachers talk about the church as the Body of Christ. But very few Christians realize that this Body is the issue of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Therefore, if we don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy the riches of Christ, we may have the doctrine of the Body of Christ, but it would be impossible to have the real experience of the Body-life.</p>
<p>So we must see that to realize the real church life, the real Body-life, we need the experience of Christ as the indwelling One. There is no other way for Christ to supply us with all His riches. Ephesians 5 tells us that just as people nourish and cherish their bodies, so Christ nourishes and cherishes His church. But how can Christ nourish His church? It is by His indwelling. He nourishes His church by His indwelling. As we enjoy all of His riches, He makes His home in our heart. This is the way He nourishes His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY</h2>
<p>We all know that the basic need in the church life today is the building. Ephesians tells us that there must be the building up of the Body of Christ. But without the proper enjoyment of Christ, there is no possibility of any kind of building up. Building is something that can not be easily separated. Do you believe that anything that has been built into a building could be easily separated? It would be very difficult. If the materials were just piled up, it would be easy to separate them, but once they have been built into a building, it is very difficult to pull them out.</p>
<p>To stay with the brothers and sisters for one or two years doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have the real building. You have to check whether your building up with the saints is real or counterfeit. It may not be a building up, but a piling up. To check the kind of building you have is to see whether or not you can leave easily. If you can, it means that you have never been builded in.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christianity, there is no building. The most that they have is a piling up. And in many situations, there is not even a piling up. Today I can meet with you, and tomorrow I can leave. If this is true, it proves that I have never been built in.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER BUILDING</h2>
<p>Then how can we have the proper building? Don&rsquo;t try to do it by yourself. That never works. The only building that avails comes out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. If we don&rsquo;t have the experience of Christ nourishing and cherishing the Body, we cannot be built up with others. Sometimes we think that if the Lord would put us together with brother so-and-so, it would be easier to be built up. But God&rsquo;s sovereignty did not put us with him, and if He did, we would find that he is the same as the rest. It is not a matter of the persons we are with; it is a matter of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>I can testify of Brother Watchman Nee, for I was with him for such a long time. Throughout his entire life he never changed co-workers. A small number left him, but he never changed. It was so easy for him to be built up with others.</p>
<p>Whenever we feel that it is difficult for us to be built with the brothers surrounding us, we must realize that we are short of the enjoyment of Christ. We are short of the nourishing of the indwelling Christ. If we experience the nourishing Christ through His indwelling, we can be built up with anyone. Don&rsquo;t consider that it is difficult for others to be built up. They are not the problem. We are the problem. If we would enjoy the riches of Christ and let Him nourish us, there would be no problem. The problem comes out of the shortage of the enjoyment of Christ. If we have the adequate enjoyment of Christ, His nourishing through His indwelling will solve every problem.</p>
<p>We have found by experience that rebuking others does not help much. If you are wrong and I come and correct you, I may offend you; I would not help you. I did this in the past and it never accomplished much. We cannot do much by rebuking people. What they need, and what we also need, is the real enjoyment of Christ. If we would enjoy Christ more, and then share what we have enjoyed of Christ with people, this would nourish them, and we would see more building up. Rebuking and correcting may work a little, but there is not much help with life. The help with life always comes from the proper enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>To experience the proper enjoyment of Christ, we must experience His indwelling. Only Christ can build. Many people talk today about being Spirit-filled, but there is no real experience of the indwelling Christ. Just look at their daily walk. They know how to talk about the Spirit, but they don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy and partake of all the riches of Christ in their spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>In the book of Ephesians, the Body of Christ is clearly revealed in chapter one. &ldquo;And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22-23). But this chapter does not tell us the essential nature of the Body. The essential nature of the Body is but the riches of Christ experienced by us. It is when we experience the riches of Christ that the essential nature of the Body is produced. The Body comes from the experience of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Many times I have illustrated in this way. Suppose we have a big American man. What is the essential nature of this man? He is composed of American chickens, beef, apples, oranges, and many other rich items of this rich country. But this does not mean that if we put all these items together we will have a big American man. That would be merely a pile of the items of the riches of America. But when all these items are eaten and assimilated, such a big American man is produced.</p>
<p>In the same way, if we put all the riches of Christ together, that is not the Body. The Body comes out of the experiential enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This is why it is so difficult to find the Body of Christ today in a practical way. In a sense, doctrinally speaking, there is the Body of Christ. But where is it practically? Throughout all the centuries, there has been no shortage of teachings, doctrines, and gifts. But there has been a shortage of the real experience of the riches of Christ that bring forth the Body of Christ in a practical way.</p>
<p>Some people tell me, when they read all the books we have put out in Chinese and in English, that all we talk about is Christ and the church. Once, when I went to Texas, a lady asked me why I did not say anything about the home life. My answer was that there is too much talk about the home life, but very little about Christ and the church. We must realize that the Lord has a shortage on the earth. I have been staying in this country for twelve years, yet I still have the same burden to tell everyone that they need the enjoyment of Christ in order to produce the Body of Christ. We have to come back to the book of Ephesians again and again to see that only the riches of Christ experienced by us can produce the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTED INTO A FULL-GROWN MAN</h2>
<p>We have seen already, in chapter three of Ephesians, how the Lord must make His home in our heart. Then in chapter four, we see that we all must be perfected into a full-grown man. We must grow up into Him as the Head, that out from Him the whole Body might be built up. &ldquo;For the perfecting of the saints, to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the body of Christ. Till we all arrive at the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ....But holding the reality in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: out from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh growth of the body unto the building up of itself in love&rdquo; (Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16). This is altogether a matter of His indwelling. Out of His indwelling we will be perfected and grow up into Him, that out of Him the Body might come forth.</p>
<p>All mothers know that the perfecting of their children is not mainly a matter of teaching them. All the little babes have complete organs, but the functions are not developed. They have ears, but they cannot hear properly. They have eyes, but they cannot see so well. They have feet, but they cannot walk. They really need the perfecting work of the mother. If you try only to teach them to hear, to see, and to walk, you will kill them. This is not the perfecting they need. Real perfecting is to feed them, to nourish them, and to cherish them. Then they will grow into the proper function of all these organs.</p>
<p>This is the need of the church today. The church needs the proper nourishing, not with doctrines and teachings, but with the living Christ as the life-giving Spirit with all of His riches. The leading ones in the churches must realize that it is not simply a matter of taking the lead. There are many good leaders in the world. But what the church needs is some leading ones who know how to enjoy Christ themselves, and how to minister this Christ to others in a living way. Then all the members will be perfected to build up the Body.</p>
<p>I am so happy to see that in these past few years so many have been brought into the real enjoyment of Christ. Nothing else could make me so happy. Even if we had 100,000 people coming to our meetings, yet very few of them experienced the real enjoyment of Christ, it would mean nothing. We would have a crowd, but we would not have the Body. The Body of Christ can only come out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>This is why, in all these past years in the churches, we have not practiced much correction. In a sense, some things are not good, yet we do not like to touch them. The church life is something living. It is not like chair arranging. We can arrange the chairs in a very good way, but if we go to an orchard, it is different. In an orchard, you have to let them grow. You cannot say that one tree is too high, so you must cut it off; or another tree is too short, so you must pull it up. This may work in arranging chairs, but if you do this in an orchard you will kill everything. What the trees of the orchard need is watering, nourishing, and fertilizing that they may grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING INTO HIM</h2>
<p>Likewise, there is no other way to help the saints to be perfected, but by helping them to get the proper nourishment from the riches of Christ. And this is by His indwelling. Therefore, the key point in the book of Ephesians is that Christ make His home in our heart. The building up of the Body of Christ comes out of this. It is thus that we will have a strong and enriched church life. Correction will produce little. What the church needs is the nourishment of Christ. It is only by enjoying His nourishment that He will spread within us to make His home in our heart. By His nourishment, He will grow in us, and by His growing, He will make His home in us. Then, though some may try to separate us, they cannot succeed, because we have all grown together into Him. We have grown up into Him by the riches of His indwelling. This is the real building, the real unity, and the producing of the full-grown man.</p>
<p>When Christ makes His home in our heart, our whole being will be saturated by Christ. We will be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and we will put on the new man. &ldquo;And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which according to God is created in righteousness and true holiness&rdquo; (Eph. 4:23-24). By Christ spreading within us, our mind is brought under the control of our spirit. So our spirit is called the spirit of our mind. Now every part of our being&mdash;mind, emotion, and will&mdash;is under the influence of the Spirit. In this way we put on the new man, which is the church life.</p>
<p>The church does not need organizing, but growing. And the growing comes out of the nourishment of the indwelling Christ. If we know how to receive the nourishment of Christ, then He will take over our mind, saturate our emotion, and subdue our will. We will grow because He is growing within us. In His growing, we grow up into Him. The way we grow up into Him is to let Him grow in us. But this is not an individual matter. When we grow into Him, we all grow into one another. Therefore, no situation or circumstance can separate us, because we have the real building up in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>This is what all the churches need. We must learn to enjoy the indwelling Christ by taking Him as our person, that He may grow within us to be our everything. Then He will spread Himself into our being, and we will all grow up into Him to have the proper building.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21; 2:5, 13-14; 3:8, 10; 4:4-7, 12-13</h1>
<p>We have seen in the past messages that by the time we come to Ephesians, the church has come into being through the indwelling of Christ. This is the climax. If we look into the content of all the books of the New Testament up to the end of Ephesians, we can see that Paul has reached a consummation. He has presented to us the all-inclusive Christ, and he has showed us the Body, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Yet Paul the Apostle is a good minister and a good writer. Even after reaching the climax, he still has something to say. Therefore, the book of Philippians follows Ephesians. The arrangement of the books of the New Testament is really something of the Spirit of the Lord. Suppose we were to put Philippians before Acts, or even after Galatians. It simply would not fit so well. But in the order in which we have them, they give a clear, meaningful picture.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the book of Philippians? If we have the proper light from the Lord, we can see that following Ephesians, the book on the church, Philippians gives us a real picture of the practical way to have the church life. After seeing the wonderful church life in the book of Ephesians, we need to know how to practice it. Therefore, Philippians follows Ephesians to show us the practical way of the church life.</p>
<p>In a sense, the book of Philippians is not merely a book of revelation, but a book of practice. We have chosen verses from each of the four chapters of this book, and all of these representative verses speak mostly of practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TESTING</h2>
<p>Consider Philippians 1:19. &ldquo;For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Undoubtedly, this is a practical daily experience. So many things happened to Paul. Whenever we see how much Christ is to us and what the church life is, we can be assured that things will happen. There is not one exception. If we mean business with the Lord, we must be prepared for the things to happen. The demons may be stirred up, the wind may blow, and the rain may fall. The children may become naughty, the wives may become rebellious, and the husbands may become hard. If you are a teacher, your class may give you much trouble. If you are a general manager, the employees may give you a difficult time. If you are an employee, your boss may not treat you well.</p>
<p>Even if your circumstances are good, that is still a test to you. Many saints, after seeing something of Christ and the church, can take the sufferings, but they cannot stand the good situations. Some after seeing the church may lose their job. But that loss of employment will eventually turn to their salvation. However, some after seeing the church get a better job. And this better position, instead of turning them to their salvation, turns them away from the church. Sometimes the good that comes to us may not be a real help. But still that is a test. Sometimes the greatest test is not affliction, but prosperity.</p>
<p>In other words, after seeing something of Christ and the vision of the church, the Lord will surely put us on test, and He knows just what kind of test we need. Some need the test of a troublesome wife. Others need the test of a very obedient wife. Sometimes it is hard to tell which is better. Of course, humanly speaking, an obedient wife is much better, but spiritually speaking, only the Lord knows. Only the Lord knows what kind of wife we need, and whether she is good or bad, she is still a test to us.</p>
<p>Paul had no wife, but he still had much trouble. Some of the churches gave him trouble. By reading all his writings, we see that he had many problems with the churches. From reading 2 Corinthians we can see that the Corinthians even thought Paul was cheating them in the matter of money (2 Cor. 12:16). So Paul told them that he would never take anything from them, but rather he would spend and be spent for them (2 Cor. 12:13, 15). We may say that the church in Philippi was good to him. But in Philippi there was a problem of the practical church life. All the Epistles were written due to the fact that there were some problems. We thank the Lord for these problems; otherwise, we would not have these Epistles today. First Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, and Colossians were all written because of problems.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT</h2>
<p>For the problem of the practical church life, Paul told the Philippians that all the things which happened to him would turn to his salvation through their prayer and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We all must realize that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is more bountifully rich than just the Spirit of God. In one sense the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, but in another sense there is a great difference.</p>
<p>Before the Lord was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, the Spirit was the Spirit of God. There was no element of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, or ascension in this Spirit. Therefore the Spirit was merely and purely the Spirit of God. But after the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Within this Spirit, there was not only the element of God, but also the element of man. There was the divine and the human element. There was also the element of the termination of the crucifixion, the germination of the resurrection, the ascension, and the exaltation. Now this Spirit is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This bountifully rich Spirit includes the divine element, the human element, the termination of the negative things, the germination of the new creation, the exaltation, kingship, lordship, and headship. Hallelujah! What a bountiful supply is now in this Spirit! Whatever we need, we have in the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>However, such a bountiful supply could never be realized, experienced, and enjoyed, without the Spirit of Jesus Christ indwelling us. Even if He were on the earth, without His indwelling we could never participate in His bountiful supply. This bountiful, rich Spirit must indwell us. Then whatever He has and whatever He is will be our experience.</p>
<p>Paul tells us that the practical way to have the church life is to know that in whatever circumstances we are, we have within us the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ. Whatever happens to us must turn us to our salvation in this rich supply. We don&rsquo;t have to pray for the circumstances to come or not to come. We leave that to the Lord. But we must pray, and have others pray for us, that we will realize the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We must learn to experience the rich supply of this Spirit in all our situations. This experience will produce the practical church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAGNIFIED</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s only concern was that all the things which happened to him would turn to his salvation through the realization of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Then he said, &ldquo;According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:20-21). Paul realized that by death or life, God&rsquo;s purpose was to magnify Christ in him. To magnify Christ includes the expression of Christ with a kind of dignity. Christ must be expressed in us, but not in a poor way. He must be expressed in a magnified and dignified way.</p>
<p>With some of the more mature saints, we can realize a kind of spiritual dignity. Because they have experienced Christ to such an extent, they express Christ with dignity. Christ is magnified in them not only in the positive things of life, but also in the negative things of death. Whether their environment is positive or negative, it means nothing to them. All things are the same, simply creating opportunities for them to magnify Christ. This is why Paul could eventually say, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ.&rdquo; He was in the practical experience of the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MIND OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Then in chapter two, Paul tells us that we must have the mind of Christ. &ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Phil. 2:5). This corresponds to that which is mentioned in Romans 12:2. There we see that we must be transformed by the renewing of our mind. This means that our mind is replaced with the mind of Christ. In other words, we must take the person of Christ. We must put our mind aside, and take the mind of Christ. This is a kind of substitution. We reject our own person, and take Christ as our person. Therefore, His mind becomes our mind.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD WORKING IN US</h2>
<p>After this, verse 13 of the same chapter says, &ldquo;For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.&rdquo; In this book, some verses speak of Christ&rsquo;s indwelling, one speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and here is a verse that says that God is working in us. Who then is working, God, Christ, or the Spirit? It is so simple: when the Spirit works, that is Christ working, and when Christ works, that is God working. They are three in one. We do not have three persons indwelling us. We have only one. God in Christ as the Spirit is indwelling us and working in us.</p>
<p>We all like Philippians 2:13 because it tells us that God is working in us. But the next verse is quite practical. We might think that it should tell us to do all things to glorify God. But it says, &ldquo;Do all things without murmurings and disputings&rdquo; (Phil. 2:14). This is a real test of whether we are enjoying the working of God in us or not. Are we murmuring or disputing? These two things are so practical and ordinary. If you would not murmur for one week, you would be the leading saint.</p>
<p>There are no high doctrines in this book. We only find some practical matters to help us in the church life. Have you ever seen a book in Christianity entitled, <em>Without Murmuring</em> ? We do need to publish such a book. This is not some great teaching, this is something very practical. Do you murmur about your wife or husband? Do you murmur about the brothers and sisters, or the church service? Paul was so wise; he knew that the biggest hindrance in the practical church was murmuring and disputing. This is especially true of the sisters. They don&rsquo;t like to dispute outwardly, but they do it inwardly. They would not outwardly criticize anything announced by the elders, but still there is some disputing within. This is why Paul tells us to let God work in us without murmuring and disputing.</p>
<p>How can this be possible? Only by exchanging persons. We all have to be replaced in our thinking, our concepts, and our ideas. It is better not to know so much. We only need to learn to take Christ as our person and minister Him to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COUNTING ALL THINGS LOSS</h2>
<p>Now we come to chapter three. We all love this chapter because Paul tells us how absolute he was to gain Christ. &ldquo;Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ. That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death&rdquo; (Phil. 3:8, 10).</p>
<p>Paul says that he counted all the religious things as loss for Christ. When he compared his religion with Christ, he realized that every bit of his old religion was a loss. So he left it all for Christ. Not only so, but he counted <em>all</em> things loss for Christ. He counted not only the religious things, but <em>all</em> things. To count everything as loss means to count as loss the whole human culture. This includes religion and all the things of the human life. Paul counted all these things as dung. This word in our modern usage would mean trash or garbage. Paul counted all things as garbage that he might gain Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDWELLING RESURRECTION POWER</h2>
<p>All the religious things were quite precious to him in the past. But once he came to know Christ, he counted them all as loss. He even counted the whole human culture as trash that he might gain Christ. The way to gain Christ is to know Him. This means to experience Him in the power of His resurrection. This is something of His indwelling. We could never experience the power of Christ in resurrection without His indwelling. If He were merely in the heavens, how could we experience the power of His resurrection? It is similar to today&rsquo;s electricity. Until it is installed in the building, we can never experience its power. Praise the Lord that Christ has been installed into us! Now we can experience His resurrection power, and by this we gain Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CONFORMED TO HIS IMAGE</h2>
<p>It is by this experience of gaining Christ that we also know the fellowship of His suffering. By this fellowship of His suffering we are conformed to His image. This is even higher than transformation. Transformation is something within; it is a matter of essence. But conformity is something outward. Christ has a form, and we need to be conformed to His form. This is only possible by the fellowship of His sufferings. This is not a kind of suffering because of our sins or mistakes. This is a suffering for the life of the Body of Christ. For the life of the Body, we need a kind of suffering. Then the Body of Christ will be increased in life through our suffering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REJOICE IN THE LORD</h2>
<p>In chapter four, Paul tells us to rejoice. &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God&rdquo; (Phil. 4:4, 6). To rejoice is a little different from being joyful. Just to be joyful is not to rejoice. To rejoice means to be joyful with some kind of praising and thanksgiving. It is impossible to rejoice and remain silent. Sometimes we have to shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Jesus is so wonderful!&rdquo; This is rejoicing. To rejoice means to let your joy be expressed.</p>
<p>I have noticed that some saints, according to their disposition, can never rejoice. I never saw their face beaming and their mouth rejoicing. The most they can do is smile a little. But this is not rejoicing! We have to shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah! O Lord Jesus! Amen!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean to teach you to do this, but we have to be like this. Christians must be rejoicing people. Even if we are alone in our home, we still must rejoice. No one may be visible, but there are many invisible ones watching. When we are rejoicing and praising the Lord, all the demons are cringing. This is why the victorious life is a rejoicing life.</p>
<p>Then Paul tells us to be careful for nothing. According to today&rsquo;s meaning, some might think that this means to be careless. But the real meaning is not to worry. Some versions say that we should be anxious for nothing. If we are rejoicing, it is certain that we are not worrying. But the more we try not to worry, the more we will worry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE SECRET</h2>
<p>How can we not worry but rejoice? In ourselves it is impossible. But if we have learned the secret of taking Christ as our person through His indwelling, it is so spontaneous. In the last part of this chapter, Paul tells us that he had learned the secret. &ldquo;I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I have learned the secret both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things in Christ who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13-14).</p>
<p>Paul was not always so abounding, rich, and full. Many times he was abased. He was even hungry and had nothing to eat. Yet he had learned the secret both to be abased and to abound. Almost all of us have a kind of religious concept. If a brother becomes poor, we say that either he does not know how to manage himself, or he must be wrong with the Lord in some area. But how about the Apostle Paul? Was God punishing him? He did suffer poverty, but not because he was wrong. Rather that afforded him an opportunity to experience Christ. To him riches or poverty were of the same color. Whether the circumstances were good or not so good, he had learned the secret to rejoice in the Lord always.</p>
<p>Many times when I am worrying about something, the Lord rebukes me: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you enjoy Me as the One that takes care of you? Why not let Me worry for you?&rdquo; When we learn the secret of taking Christ as our person, we learn to cast all our care upon Him. In Philippians, a book that speaks about Paul&rsquo;s circumstances, we see the secret for the Christian life and the practical way for the church life. That is, we must learn to take Christ as our person. We must let Him replace us. We cannot rejoice. We cannot be anxious for nothing. Our life is full of anxiety.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CASTING ALL OUR CARE ON HIM</h2>
<p>There are many verses in the Bible which are precious promises of God to us. In Matthew 6 the Lord promises us that we don&rsquo;t need to be anxious for food, drink, or clothing. The Father knows what we need. Then 1 Peter 5:7 says, &ldquo;Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.&rdquo; He indwells us and bears all our cares. He not only bears our burdens, He even bears us. Therefore, why should we worry? We cannot add one inch to our height by worrying. We must fully give ourselves over to Him.</p>
<p>I realize that to say this is easy, but to put it into practice is much more difficult. When we try to rejoice, after we shout three times, we start worrying. We hardly have any faith at all. Then what shall we do? We must forget about ourselves and turn to Him. Let the Lord live for you. Let Him bear all the burden. Cast all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you. Since He cares for us, we don&rsquo;t need to care. I realize that regardless of what I say, you will still care very much. But you have a Person within you. Turn to Him and let Him bear all your burdens.</p>
<p>When we are in good circumstances, it is easy to praise the Lord. But when we are in bad circumstances, we can never praise the Lord. Today the sun is shining, but yesterday it was cloudy. This is the practical church life. Some days are full of sunshine, and some days are cloudy. But when we read Paul&rsquo;s life, we see that he had learned the secret. The secret is the indwelling Christ. Whether it is sunny or cloudy, whether the circumstances are good or bad, we have a wonderful Person living within us, bearing all our burdens. We must only learn to turn to Him and let Him be our person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECRET OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we see from this book the practical way to have the church life. It is simply to realize all the time that the indwelling Christ is our secret. It is not a matter of how to face the situation. That is politics. Only the politicians must learn how to face the situation. We simply let the situations turn to our salvation. All of our circumstances teach us to learn the secret to live by Christ. This is the main lesson of this whole book. All the circumstances force us to give up ourselves and take Christ as our person. This is the secret. Of course, there is not this kind of terminology, but there is the fact.</p>
<p>Philippians is not a book of teachings or doctrines. Paul simply tells us something of his own experience. And through his experience we learn of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We learn to let Christ be magnified in us. We learn that we can do all things in Christ who empowers us. Whether we are rich or poor, high or low, we have learned the secret that Christ lives in us to be our person, bearing all of our burdens. Therefore, all we have to do is rejoice evermore. Hallelujah! This is the key to the Christian life, and this is the practical way of the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12, 18-19, 27; 2:2b, 6, 8-9; 3:4a, 10-11</h1>
<p>Paul has written at least thirteen epistles. The first group of these epistles starts with Romans and ends with Colossians. Following this section, there is a supplementary group containing 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and Hebrews.</p>
<p>The first main section of Romans through Colossians deals with Christ and the church. In these epistles we see how Christ must be wrought into us as our life; then we will learn to live by Him, taking Him as our person. It is by this kind of living experience that the church comes into being.</p>
<p>Colossians is the closing book of this section. Actually, it seems that this book should follow Ephesians. Ephesians speaks of the Body, and Colossians speaks of the Head. But in between we have Philippians, which shows us the practical way to have the church life. Then we have Colossians to close out this section about Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Since Colossians speaks about Christ as the Head of the Body, we would expect the book to begin in this way. But first of all, it tells us that Christ is the portion of all the saints. &ldquo;Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the portion of the saints in light&rdquo; (Col. 1:12). Praise the Lord that Christ is our portion! This word &ldquo;portion&rdquo; in Greek means lot. God did not allocate to us anything but Christ. He is our lot, He is our portion.</p>
<p>I would say that very few Christians realize that Christ is their portion. But we must see that this indwelling Christ is our practical portion. Day by day we must enjoy Him and participate in Him. This verse speaks about partaking. We are not the students, studying about Christ. We are the partakers of the enjoyment of Christ as our portion. This is something of God. God has made us meet to be partakers of the portion of Christ. Do not listen to the lies of the enemy. He would tell us that we are not worthy of Christ. But this verse strongly tells us that we are fully qualified to be the partakers of Christ. This is our portion, and this is our lot.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHO IS CHRIST?</h2>
<p>Following this, Colossians tells us who Christ is. But it does not say that Christ is our Savior. Rather, it says that Christ must be the One that has first place. &ldquo;And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell&rdquo; (Col. 1:18-19). Christ is the beginning, Christ is the ending, and Christ must have the preeminence.</p>
<p>All the fulness of God dwells in Him. &ldquo;For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (Col. 2:9). We must realize that Christ in the book of Colossians is very much deeper than in the Gospel of Luke. In the Gospel of Luke, Christ is our Savior. But in Colossians we see One who contains all the fulness of the Godhead, and One who must have the preeminence in everything. He is even the mystery of God. &ldquo;To the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, even Christ&rdquo; (Col. 2:2b, Gk.). The Christ revealed in this book of Colossians is the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST RECEIVED AS OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>Then we see that we have received such a Christ. &ldquo;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him&rdquo; (Col. 2:6). This book does not say that we have received a Savior, but rather that we have received the mystery of God, the One that contains all the fullness of the Godhead. We have received the One who is first in everything. He is our portion.</p>
<p>Chapter three then tells us that this One is our life. &ldquo;When Christ, who is our life, shall appear&rdquo; (Col. 3:4a). We could never imagine that our life could be such a person. He is the mystery of God, He holds all the fulness of God, He has the preeminence in everything, and He is our life. This is indeed wonderful!</p><h2 class="head1">A WARNING</h2>
<p>However, this book also has a warning. It does not warn us to beware of sinful things, but rather of philosophy and the rudiments of the world. &ldquo;Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ&rdquo; (Col. 2:8). This refers to the thought, the science, and the philosophy of human culture. Philosophy may be considered as one of the best elements of human culture. Among human inventions, it is considered the best, yet we must realize that it is the most subtle instrument of the enemy to distract people from Christ. Once philosophy enters man&rsquo;s mind, it is exceedingly difficult for that person to come to Christ.</p>
<p>Some real Christians today have been distracted from Christ by a kind of Christian philosophy. But any kind of philosophy is the subtle work of Satan. All philosophies are satanic and demonic. This is why this book tells us to beware of philosophy. Of course, the outward appearance is always attractive, but it is subtly attractive. Through philosophy, many minds have been fully saturated with demonic thoughts. This is why we must beware of it. Even theology becomes a kind of philosophy. We will take <em>theos,</em> but we don&rsquo;t want the <em>-ology.</em> Beware of any kind of <em>-ology.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">WALK IN A LIVING PERSON</h2>
<p>For this reason we must learn to walk in Christ. &ldquo;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.&rdquo; We have received Him, so now we must walk in Him. Even in the matter of the church life, we must be careful. In the church life our fellowship is not of any kind of <em>-ology.</em> Our fellowship is of a living Person. It is as we walk in this Person that He becomes our portion. He is not only our Person, but also our portion. And He is God&rsquo;s mystery, containing all the fullness of the Godhead. As such, He must have first place. Then He will become our life and everything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>Eventually, Colossians shows us the new man, where Christ is all in all. &ldquo;And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all&rdquo; (Col. 3:10-11). To be in the new man means to be in the practical church life. In this life, there is nothing of the old nature, but Christ is all and in all.</p>
<p>So many Christians believe that this is not possible today on earth. They say that we must wait until the future; then Christ will be all and in all. We agree that Christ will be all and in all in the future, but here it does not say that Christ <em>will be</em> all and in all. It says that in the new man, Christ <em>is</em> all and in all. Right now in the church life, Christ is all and in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATION OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h2>
<p>This is only possible by the indwelling of Christ. &ldquo;To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory&rdquo; (Col. 1:27). This book is the consummation of the indwelling of Christ. Otherwise, how could Christ be our portion? And how could He have first place in our life? It is only by His indwelling. By His indwelling we enjoy Him as the mystery of God, the fulness of the Godhead, our life, and our portion.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must beware of anything that distracts us from this indwelling Christ, especially any kind of <em>-ology.</em> Instead, as we have received Christ, we must simply walk in Him, taking Him as our Person. Then eventually, in the church life, there will be nothing of the old nature. Christ will be all and in all through His indwelling of all the members. I do pray that all the churches, by God&rsquo;s grace, will practice the indwelling of Christ.</p></body></html>
