   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF THE WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the need of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing we have to mention is the offering of money by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The offerings of the believers are not merely for the support of the workers; they are to supply those who work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, one does not offer to a certain person simply because he is a worker; he offers to that person because he works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What he is personally is one matter, and whether or not he works is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as he works for the Lord, he deserves to be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The question is not whether or not he has money, but whether or not he works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If he works for the Lord, he deserves to be supported.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man paying a rickshaw operator does not ask if he is rich or poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether he is rich or poor has nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as he has worked, he deserves his wages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person cannot say that because a worker has money, he does not need to be supported.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Someone once intended to make an offering to Mr. Bright, a co-worker of Dr. Scofield.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the person next to him said that the Lord would take care of Mr. Bright s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the man took back his offering, and Mr. Bright was left without the support.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Believers should not offer their money just because the workers are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they give because of the worker s poverty, they are not making an offering but are giving alms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Making an offering is the least that a saved person can do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a saved man does not offer up himself, he is a useless person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a man has received grace, there should be a result of offering up all that he has to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not normal for a person to receive grace and not be willing to offer up all that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All those whose hearts have been touched by God will give up their money purse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is impossible for a person s heart to be touched by God without his possessions also being touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Consecration allows God to touch everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only after God has touched him will love flow out from him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man has never offered up himself, there will surely not be the outflow of love from him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, there are only two gods in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first is mammon, and the other is the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not love God, we will love mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only when a man loves God will his heart be broadened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The thing that broadens man s heart the most is the giving of money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A believer among us attended meetings in a certain denomination for twenty years but never even nodded his head toward another person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later he offered himself up, and his whole being changed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Previously I was afraid of reporting to others about our financial condition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But today I have turned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a way for others to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more a person offers, the more he will be filled with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These words are for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now let us consider the way to dispense the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Part of the money received in the meetings should be set aside for the local workers and the workers in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a sign of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul praised the Philippians for their grace in this matter Phil 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They continued to fellowship with the apostle in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The condition of the Corinthians was just the opposite; they developed a problem in their fellowship with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, Paul was willing to allow other churches to suffer, rather than ask for any money from the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not use the Corinthians money because there was a problem with the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when there is fellowship can there be a material offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord that the brothers in Shanghai have received grace in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The workers from out of town should not misunderstand and think that the church in Shanghai is so rich that it can keep sending money out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The reason the church in Shanghai is able to send money out is because the local workers in Shanghai have received only a little local support.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the church is able to send out so much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the grace of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The offerings to individuals should be personally wrapped in an envelope by the offerer, marked with the name of the worker, and dropped into the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brothers who open the box should then personally hand this offering directly to the receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE WAY THE WORKERS HANDLE THEIR FINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, workers should not make others feel that they are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A worker lives by faith, not by alms giving.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a shame to let others know that you are poor with the hope of receiving support.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a worker receives a supply from the brothers, he should have the proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a worker receives money from the brothers, he is receiving this money on God s behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He stands on God s side and represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, he should not have a beggarly attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Paul mentioned the matter of money, he gave others an honorable and respectable impression.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the proper attitude for every worker.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Second, whenever any worker receives more than other workers, he should distribute the excess to the other workers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not be afraid that by doing this, others will misunderstand and think that you are rich or have struck a fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Moreover, for personal family needs, there is sometimes the necessity of short-term savings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Proverbs teaches this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Third, there must be some planning in the way one uses his money.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many people buy useless things when they have money.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of behavior will stop God s supply.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One has to plan the way he uses his money.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One must have a budget and carefully consider before God what he should and should not buy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He should not buy carelessly and waste money.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Fourth, workers must never borrow.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A worker of God should prefer to die than borrow from others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If he does not have the faith that his living will be cared for, he should look for some work to sustain his living.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If he has the faith that God will sustain him, he should not stretch out his hand to others.</S>
