[1]  Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
[2]  It is significant that Romans 8:16 does not use the term the Spirit of God, as in Genesis 1:2, or the Holy Spirit, as in Matthew 1:18.
[3]  Zechariah 12:1 says, Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.
[4]  CHAPTER TWO THE TWO SPIRITS FOR THE DIVINE SONSHIP Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4-5; John 1:12-13; 3:6b; Gal 4:4-6; Rom 8:14-16, 29 THE DIVINE SONSHIP
[5]  The Bible reveals that God wants to have many sons.
[6]  Ephesians 1:4-5 says, Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[7]  In eternity past, before we were created or born, God selected us.
[8]  We need to realize that we are no longer merely human, for something divine has been added into us.
[9]  Just as water becomes tea-water when tea is added to it, so we become divinely human when God is added into us.
[10]  CHAPTER THREE The Indwelling of the Spirit Scripture Reading: Rom 8:15, 9-11; Gal 4:6 THE MINGLED SPIRIT
[11]  This verse says, You have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!
[12]  The answer to this mystery is that the spirit of sonship is not merely the human spirit nor merely the divine Spirit but the regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled as one with the divine Spirit.
[13]  Romans 8:15 says that in our spirit of sonship we cry, Abba, Father!
[14]  However, according to Galatians 4:6 it is the Spirit of God s Son who cries to the Father, and He cries from our hearts.
[15]  Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit is with our spirit, but Galatians 4:6 says that God has sent the Spirit into our hearts.
[16]  Because our spirit is in our heart 1 Pet 3:4 , when the Spirit comes into our spirit, He spontaneously comes into our heart.
[17]  CHAPTER FOUR The Riches of the indwelling Spirit Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 9-11, 15 THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE
[18]  We need to see the riches that we have within our spirit.
[19]  In Romans 8, verse 2 and verses 9 through 11 show us the unsearchable riches of the indwelling Spirit.
[20]  Verse 2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
[21]  Because the Spirit is in us, the divine life and the law of the Spirit of life are in us as well.
[22]  In verse 2 we see the Spirit of life, and in verse 9 we see the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.
[23]  According to the Bible, human beings were created by God with a spirit.
[24]  Just as we have an appetite for physical food and grow hungry several times each day because we have a stomach, so we have a spiritual appetite and hunger for God because we have a spiritual stomach our spirit.
[25]  The indwelling Spirit is also the Spirit of God and is God Himself v. 9 . As the Spirit of God, He ministers God into us.
[26]  The great and all-inclusive God is the origin, the Originator, the Creator, the Administrator, and the Father.
[27]  As soon as we switch on by calling on the Lord or by crying to the Father v. 15 , the indwelling Spirit supplies us with God.
[28]  The goal of the Lord s recovery is not to recover any particular doctrine or practice but to recover Christ as the Spirit in our spirit for the church life and every aspect of our daily life, including our family life, school life, and job life.
[29]  THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: John 4:24; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:6, 9-11 THE IMPORTANCE OF ROMANS 8
[30]  The entire Bible reveals God s economy and His eternal purpose, to dispense Himself in His Trinity into human beings, who were created by Him with three parts spirit, soul, and body.
[31]  First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam, who is Christ the Son, became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection.
[32]  It is a test to prove how real God is and how faithful we are.
[33]  It tells us that God today is the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is real, practical, and subjective to us because He indwells us.
[34]  Romans 8 reveals that this indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of life with the divine life and an automatic law, the Spirit of God with all the contents of God s being and work, the Spirit of Christ with all Christ s being and accomplishments, and the resurrecting Spirit vv.
[35]  Through regeneration our deadened spirit was enlivened and resurrected.
[36]  Now the all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our spirit and has mingled Himself with our spirit, making us one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .
[37]  Although human words cannot adequately define this mingling, it is nevertheless a fact that the processed Triune God as the Spirit has mingled Himself with our spirit to produce one mingled spirit.
[38]  Now that we are saved, we have something more mysterious within us the Triune God as the Spirit mingling Himself with our spirit to be one mingled spirit.
[39]  TO THE THREE PARTS OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Rom 8:6, 10-11 THE SPIRIT AND LIFE IN ROMANS 8
[40]  The first eighteen verses are especially abstract and mysterious because the main components of these verses are the Spirit and life.
[41]  We may know that this chapter covers the two spirits the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers but these two spirits are mysterious and abstract.
[42]  Thus, the expression the Spirit of life indicates that Spirit is life, that the Spirit and life are one.
[43]  When we contact the Lord in the morning by reading His word or praying to Him, we do not need to consider how to improve our behavior, conduct, or deeds.
[44]  Instead, we should consider only our need for the life supply.
[45]  We need to realize that the life supply to our body for the things of God is very lacking, the life supply in our mind insufficient, and even the life supply in our spirit is quite poor.
[46]  Whenever we touch the things of God, we need to realize that God wants to supply us with life and that the life supply is within us.
[47]  Likewise, we need to touch our spirit to receive the bountiful life supply of the Spirit who flows within our spirit.
