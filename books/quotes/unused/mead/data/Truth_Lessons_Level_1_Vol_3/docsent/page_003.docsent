   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Being under God s Wrath</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because men have sinned and violated God s righteousness, they are not only condemned under God s judgment, but they are also children of wrath Eph 2:3 under God s wrath John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>People live in the lusts of their flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts; thus, they contradict God s righteousness and daily incite God s wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today God s wrath is waiting to explode on men like thunder ready to roar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is waiting in order to give people the opportunity to repent and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless men repent, eventually God s wrath will burst forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. To Suffer Death and Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fruit of sin is death James 1:15; Rom 6:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because men have sinned, according to the law of God s righteousness, it is reserved for men to die once Heb 9:27a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That which is placed before the impenitent sinners today is simply death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If people are not willing to repent, they have no alternative but to wait for death under the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When death comes upon men, that is the bursting forth of God s wrath on them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to what God has reserved for men, all must die once and after that face judgment Heb 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although men have been condemned already under God s judgment, they still must suffer judgment again after death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This judgment is to carry out God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God already has condemned men according to His righteousness; yet because of His love, He has not carried out His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God desires men to repent, and He also gives them the opportunity and is waiting for them to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If people would not repent, eventually they will enter into death and suffer God s final judgment, which will be the judgment before the great white throne Rev 20:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>E. To Perish in the Lake of Fire</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After suffering God s final judgment, men will suffer the penalty of eternal fire and perish in the lake of fire for eternity John 3:16; Rev 20:15; 21:8 , where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched Mark 9:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The foregoing points reveal the condition of man before God after Adam s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CONDITION IN HIMSELF A. Being Brought Forth in Iniquity</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the fall of one man, Adam, the forefather of the human race, sin entered into the world Rom 5:12 and was passed on in man from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, men are brought forth in iniquity and are conceived in sin Psa 51:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because they are born sinners and because their nature is corrupt, people do not need to learn how to sin; rather, to sin is something inherent, something which grows out from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seed of sin is in a person at his birth, and at a certain time it will grow out from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Being Constituted of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Men are not only brought forth in iniquity but also constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through Adam s disobedience the many were constituted sinners Rom 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin became the constituent of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Men were not created sinners, but constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An element not created by God was injected into men and constituted them sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin is not just an outward deed, but even more an inward element in man s constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. The Heart Being Deceitful above All Things</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because man is brought forth in iniquity and is constituted of sin, the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth Gen 8:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, man s heart is deceitful above all things, desperately wicked, and incurable Jer 17:9 , being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice, and full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malignity Rom 1:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the heart is wicked to the core and hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, this wickedness does not spread inward from the outside; it stems from within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>People may look good on the outside, yet they are actually evil on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When it becomes necessary, all the wicked things will be let out from within them Mark 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>D. Nothing Good Dwelling in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man is brought forth in iniquity and is constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, his heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, nothing good dwells in his flesh Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, it is filled with wickedness, lusts, and evil impurities that came from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Scriptures this flesh is called particularly the body of sin Rom 6:6 and the body of death Rom 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is altogether powerless in doing good, yet it is very active in committing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The works of the flesh, such as fornication, uncleanness, and sensuality, as listed in Galatians 5:19-21, clearly issue from within the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who can do the good that he wills?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is it not true that to will is present with man, but to do the good is not Rom 7:18b ?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because nothing good dwells in man s flesh, the good that man wills, he does not do; but the evil that he does not will, this he practices Rom 7:19 .</S>
