<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(61)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 17, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER D. S.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. When I was young I was very active. Someone once asked me if I had believed in the Lord. I told him yes and that I had peace in my heart. In 1935 I attended Brother Nee's Overcomer Conference in Chuanchow, Fukien. I felt the love of the Lord among the brothers and sisters and felt that it was heaven on earth. After I heard the messages on overcoming, my knowledge of the truth increased, and I felt closer to the Lord.</p><p>Once I went with a brother to preach the gospel in Ku-Tien, Fukien. At the end of the gospel meeting, I saw a squalid manual laborer confessing his fear of hell and his faith in the Lord with trembling. He consecrated himself at that very moment to the Lord and vowed to preach the gospel for Him. Prior to that I was very timid, and I would blush as soon as I opened my mouth. The squalid man's consecration touched me deeply. I became bold to preach the gospel. Fear left me. Later because of my strong craving to attend school in Shanghai, I turned away from the Lord and became cold.</p><p>The Lord did not let me go. One day while I was waiting for a bus, a voice within rebuked me, saying, "Why are you so stiff-necked? Why are you fighting with God?" I began to read the Bible and pray again, and I vowed to follow His will once more. When I read 2 Kings 15:20, the words turned back touched me. My heart was softened, and I asked for the Lord's forgiveness in tears. Once I heard the testimony of a preacher who threw his three Ph.D. diplomas into the sea in his determination to be a preacher for the Lord. The story touched me, and I dropped my thought of furthering my education. I returned to my village and worked as a common teacher, using that opportunity to spread the gospel.</p><p>Soon afterwards I quit my teaching job and worked in a transportation business. My spiritual condition deteriorated. I was not able to stand up again. The Lord allowed me to suffer twice from typhoid fever. In my sickness I prayed to the Lord and received His deliverance. During the past few years my involvement in business has unavoidably led me into cheating, deceit, and greed. I have asked for the Lord's forgiveness, and I have trusted in His blood for a purged conscience. During this time I asked the Lord for a revival. When Brother Witness Lee came, I was revived. I have a question now: Where does the line between God's work and man's responsibility lie? I have had the experience of Romans 7. After listening to the truth on this subject twice, a brother told me that I had still not broken through on this matter. I thought he meant that I did not understand the truth. Later I found that I had to break through in experience before I could know the overcoming truth. Brother Nee's word on the mountain concerning Aaron's rod has enlightened me. I see that God is the One who does all the work.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has all kinds of problems in his mind. Your mind is strong, but your disposition is weak. This is your real problem. In spiritual matters, do not try to solve the problems in the mind first. An unbeliever has many problems in the mind, but we do not try to solve these problems. Rather, we tell him to believe in the Lord first, and then the problems of his mind will be solved. If you learn to trust in God, the problems in your mind will go away easily.</p><p>The many problems in your mind have become a spiritual problem to you. Originally, they were not a spiritual problem. The worst thing with you is the combination of a weak disposition with a strong mind. Your will is weak, and your disposition is weak. You cannot expect to change these traits by doing something. Yet you can ask for the Lord's mercy and grace. He can make you the same as Peter, who was reconstituted with a durable and strong character. After the Lord's resurrection, Peter became strong, except for the one incident in Galatians 2 when he flinched. In the coming days you need to be strengthened in your character. You have to be stable, and you have to ask the Lord to make you simple. You have to learn to look to Him, rest in Him, and trust in Him. Once your character is strengthened, the problems in your mind will go away.</p>
