   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and the Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the foregoing lessons we pointed out that God's purpose is to obtain the church by dispensing Himself into man and making Himself one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to dispense Himself into man, God must be triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, man must be in God's image and have a spirit to receive God and assimilate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day, the Son of God, the embodiment of the Father, became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Passing through human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Spirit, He comes into us and mingles with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through this process there is brought into being a hybrid life, an entity composed of the mingling of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is no longer the unprocessed God, but the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has accomplished everything necessary to come into us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we must believe in Him and call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we do this, the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit, and the mingling of the divine life and human life takes place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This mingling produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our experience testifies that the very Christ whom we enjoy each day is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you not have the reality of the living One within you?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the very Christ whom we are enjoying, experiencing, and partaking of in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the life-giving Spirit who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized and experienced in us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This experience issues in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we experience Christ in this way, the more we long for the church.</S>
