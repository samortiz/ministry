   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our human living, Christ should be the entire alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If He is our alphabet, He will automatically become every word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter, and ultimately the whole book.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not letters in ourselves; rather, we are letters in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As He is an Alpha, so we are an alpha.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whenever we want to say something, we simply need to type Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Day by day we must practice and become adept at typing with Christ as the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should learn to compose something with the Triune God as letters, and we should become accustomed to using these heavenly letters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to learn to write with these letters, realizing that the New Testament actually is composed of God Himself.</S>
