THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly associates the Holy Spirit with the flowing of living water. In John 7:37-38 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Then the apostle John added a supplementary word in verse 39, saying, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; <em>Spirit</em> here refers to the Spirit of life, because John&rsquo;s speaking is always related to the divine life. We receive the Spirit of life inwardly by drinking, whereas we receive the Spirit of power outwardly by being poured upon. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit refers to the baptism in the Holy Spirit, through which we are empowered outwardly. On the one hand, the Spirit is the Spirit of power upon us to work. On the other hand, the Spirit is the Spirit of life within us to drink. Revelation 22:1-2 ultimately speaks of the aspect of the Spirit as the river of water of life.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the Spirit is God flowing into man and upon man. As the hidden source of life, God is the Father; as the manifestation and expression of life, God is the Son; and as the flowing of life into and upon man, God is the Spirit. The river is the Spirit of life, the flowing of God into and upon man, to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>God is life, and God comes to be life. God must flow out in order to be life to us. In order to become our life, God first must flow out from Himself and then flow into us. Revelation 22:1 says that a river proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Since God and the Lamb are on the throne, the river that flows out of the throne is the flowing out of God Himself. The river of living water is the flowing out of God; it is also God coming to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING THE LIVING WATER OF LIFE FLOW FREELY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving God as Life</h2>
<p>God has flowed out as the water of life, but how can man receive Him as the water of life and let this water flow freely in him? According to the record of the Bible, man first needs to receive God as life. Genesis 2 clearly shows that God placed man in the garden of Eden so that he would eat, that is, receive, from the tree of life. This indicates that God desires to enter into man as life in the way of food. After speaking of the tree of life, the Bible speaks of a river in a wonderful way. This implies that whenever man receives God as food to be his life, this life will become a flowing river in him. The Gospel of John confirms this point. In chapter 6 the Lord spoke of Himself as being bread for man to receive as life (vv. 35, 48), and then in chapter 7 He spoke of man receiving Him as life in order to drink of Him as living water (vv. 37-38). This shows that when we receive Him as the bread of life, He becomes rivers of living water in us. Hence, in order to receive the living water, we must first receive God as food into us as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting God Be Enthroned</h2>
<p>In order to let the water of life flow freely, we must also give God the ground to establish His throne in us and let Him have authority over everything in our living. The first reference to a river in the Bible links the river with food, indicating that man must receive God as life so that the water of life may flow. The last reference in the Bible to a river links the river of water of life with the throne of God, indicating that we must let God set up His throne within us, letting Him have His rightful place and letting Him rule over all things, so that the river may flow in us without any obstruction.</p>
<p>Our experience confirms this matter. First, we must believe into the Lord and receive Him as life so that the river may flow into us. Second, we must submit to the Lord, consecrate ourselves to Him, and yield to Him His rightful authority so that He may have the first place in us, be enthroned, and possess all our being. If this is our situation, the river will flow in us without any obstruction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Open and Allowing the River to Flow</h2>
<p>We must also be open so that the river has an outlet in our being. In John 4:14 the Lord said that the living water would become &ldquo;a fountain of water springing up into eternal life,&rdquo; and in 7:38 He said that rivers of living water would flow out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him. With a fountain, the emphasis is on the source, but with a river the emphasis is on the flow. In order for the living water to flow, there must be an outlet. If we want living water to spring up and flow out of us, we must open our being in addition to receiving the Lord as life and in addition to allowing Him to be enthroned in our living. The type of the New Jerusalem matches this requirement because the river freely flows; there is no obstruction to its flow.</p>
<p>In order for the living water to flow freely, there must be outlets, but God&rsquo;s children have neglected this matter. Even among us, we have heard many messages on receiving God as life, on consecrating ourselves to God, and on giving God the first place and enthroning Him. However, rarely do we speak of being open so that there is an outlet in our being to let God&rsquo;s life flow. Consequently, the river of life is not flowing through many saints. Without such an openness, the river cannot flow into some saints, and the river cannot flow out of other saints. If the river cannot flow out, the river cannot flow in. If we want water to flow in, we must let water flow out&mdash;the more water flows out, the more water will flow in. If we stop the water from flowing out, it will stop flowing in as well. The water reaches all four sides of the New Jerusalem, which means that the water flows freely throughout the entire city.</p>
<p>If we want the living water of life to flow freely, it is not enough to receive it or even to consecrate ourselves; we must open ourselves. It is not enough to receive God as life and to give God the authority to rule over us; we must open ourselves to this life. We must open ourselves to both God and to the saints so that this life can flow freely. We must be open to God as well as to the saints so that this living water in us can become a fountain and flow out of us to become a river. The river that flows out is the fellowship of God&rsquo;s children, which is the fellowship of the church. This corresponds to 1 John 1:2-3, which speaks of the fellowship among God&rsquo;s children in relation to God&rsquo;s life. The fellowship in the New Jerusalem is based on this river; there is no other fellowship. Hence, the fellowship of the church is a flow; the testimony of the church and the building of the church are also in this flow, in this fellowship.</p>
<p>If we compare the scene in Revelation with the depiction of the early church in Acts, we can see a clear correspondence. In Acts the saints received God as life, let God be on the throne, and were open to God and to one another. There was a flow of life among the saints; that is, God was flowing among them as the Holy Spirit. As a result of this flow, there was fellowship among them. This fellowship involved a connection with God and with all those who had His life. This fellowship was the flow of the Holy Spirit. This flow came out of Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, to Macedonia, and even to Rome. This flow has reached us today. According to Ezekiel 47, this flow of life swallows up death wherever it goes. When the flow reaches the sea, even the water of the sea is healed (v. 8); wherever this flow goes, death is swallowed up and life richly grows.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
