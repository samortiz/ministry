   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This section is indeed hard to understand, for it contains many expressions which cannot be applied to any mortal man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the "king of Tyrus" were only a mortal man, how could we explain the things in verses 11 through 15?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How could the king of Tyrus have been in the garden of Eden or upon the holy mountain of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could he have been the anointed cherub that covered the ark?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>None of the things mentioned here had been the experience of the king of Tyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot explain this section simply by spiritualizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is unfair if we spiritualize the interpretation of a section when we encounter difficulties in it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that the first section vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1-10 addressed to the prince of Tyrus was a word spoken to King Ithobalus II, and the second section vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>11-19 , the lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, denotes the coming Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 2 of this chapter speaks of Tyre "in the midst of the seas."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By reading Daniel 11:41-45, we know that when the coming Antichrist will be in Palestine, perhaps he will dwell at Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is why he was called the king of Tyre here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, Antichrist is Satan incarnate; therefore, numerous expressions in this section refer to Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mr. Darby said, "Verses 11-19, while continuing to speak of Tyre, go, I think, much farther, and disclose, though darkly, the fall and the ways of Satan, become through our sin the prince and god of this world." Dr. A. C. Gaebelein also said that the king of Tyre is a type of the last great sinner Antichrist , that behind this evil king, we see another power that is Satan; Satan was the power behind the king of Tyrus then, and he still is the god of this age now, who rules the nations of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have studied the Scriptures carefully, we will realize that the justification for merging Satan and Antichrist in this passage into one being is not contrary to the general teachings of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that, although human beings have their own will, their walk is either directed by God's operating Phil 2:13 or by the operating of the evil spirits Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Human beings are never totally free.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ordinarily, human beings are under the control of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes, in important matters, Satan himself, in addition to the working of evil spirits, will also participate in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we see him personally coming to tempt Christ in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, in trying to hinder Christ from going to the cross, he personally used Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After that, in attempting to destroy Christ, he entered into Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, on the world stage he will be united to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Scripture says that the works of Antichrist are "according to Satan's operation" 2 Thess.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2:9 ; it is Satan who "gave him his power and his throne and great authority" Rev 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since Antichrist is the incarnated devil, the Holy Spirit speaks of him together with Satan in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these few verses, the superhuman aspects all refer to Satan himself, and the remainder to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since our purpose is not to study the question of Antichrist, but to know the creatures of the former world and the cause of its desolation, we shall put aside the verses in this portion concerning the Antichrist and concentrate on Satan, who is related to our subject.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now let us consider the words that refer to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ezekiel 28:12 says that Satan Note: "Satan" is the name used after he had sinned; he was called the "son of the dawn" and also "Daystar" or "Lucifer" Isa 14:12 before his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Satan," which means "adversary," is his name after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the sake of convenience, we shall call him Satan in the following paragraphs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This depicts his condition before he had sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was superior to all the other angels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Phrases like "sealest up the sum," "full of," and "perfect" reveal that he was the greatest of all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God had put him above all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being "full of wisdom" probably refers to his understanding of God's will; if this is true, he might have had the office of a prophet already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first part of Ezekiel 28:13 says, "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we read Genesis 3, we indeed see Satan there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, he was not being covered by "every precious stone"; he was tempting Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the two gardens of Eden are not of the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Adam's garden of Eden, Satan had fallen, whereas here, it clearly depicts the situation before his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the garden of Eden here must be earlier than the one at Adam's time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If so, then it must not have belonged to the present world but to the previous one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This garden of Eden, like the coming New Jerusalem, had many precious stones, such as sardius, beryl, etc. The garden of Eden where Adam lived was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible focuses only on the trees and does not say anything concerning their being covered with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the garden of Eden here must be different from that of Adam and is much earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His being covered with the precious stones reminds us of the precious stones on the priest in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He probably had been appointed by God to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The latter half of the verse says, "The workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible musical instruments are used by kings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We see how David played the harp for king Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the king of Babylon was destroyed, the sound of his lutes were said to be brought down to Sheol Isa 14:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And when the king of Babylon was pleased, various musical instruments were played Dan 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Satan was a king at that time and these musical instruments were given to him by God.</S>
