   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seizing the Opportunity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Practice Speaking for the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 10:33 says that we are being made a spectacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is a spectacle, or a show, for all to see.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible to avoid criticism or praise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But I hope that we can carry out this exhibition well, and that we can meet in a proper way that will make people feel good and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a meeting will be an edification to people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this, speaking in the meeting is the best opportunity to practice speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I feel that the brothers and sisters should seize this opportunity, not just to shout and yell as we did formerly, but rather, to practice speaking the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever you practice speaking for the Lord in the meeting, it is best that you speak for only three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At most you should not exceed five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you still have something to say, sit down first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then speak after another one has finished speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In your speaking you should practice speaking in a manner that is concise, simple, and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a good opportunity to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that you would do your best to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>REALIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following this, let us take a look at the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As early as thirty years ago we realized the importance of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The greatest usefulness of a group meeting is to bring in relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A group meeting can keep people, uphold people, and relate people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No meeting can be as practical as a group meeting in communicating with and blending together the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The home meetings consist basically of family members with, at most, a few friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And the district meetings have forty to fifty people, and do not afford as much opportunity for contact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the group meetings have at most a dozen people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The opportunity for contact is great, and all are close to one another and see one another every week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This makes it easy to have the sense of being members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all know that no member of the body can be alone or isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more the members of the body fellowship and mingle together, the healthier the body will be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like the constant physical exercise of a man improving his blood circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same way, in the group meetings where the number is not big, the members can easily contact and fellowship with one another, and be mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once there is the mingling, many problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Human relationships are delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If people are too far apart, it is easy for misunderstandings to occur; but if they are too close, it is easy to have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The best way is to have contact, yet with discretion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The group meeting has just such a function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past we already knew that to keep the saved ones, we had to bring them into the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now in taking the new way, after three years of study, we are more clear concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From now on, our practice will consist of the home meetings on the small scale, and the district meetings on the large scale.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Between the home meetings and the district meetings are the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The home meetings are the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there has not been a meeting in a brother s or sister s home for a while, this eventually will become a weak point, a leak, not only to the brother himself, but to the church as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the church to be strong, it is best for all the brothers and sisters to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the district meeting, however, we have made the decision that the basic number is fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once the number exceeds eighty, it should be divided into two districts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Meanwhile, between the homes and the district must be the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without the groups, there will not be any link, nor any means to uphold the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to our experience, among the three kinds of meetings the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings the most difficult one to have is the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The district meeting has at least thirty to forty people; it is not that difficult to take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the group meeting has at most a dozen people; it is not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thirty years ago, we depended very much on the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Looking back, I feel that the small groups then were not properly arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were not like gardens, but rather like wild fields.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some small groups would not subdivide, even though their number reached more than a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As far as I am concerned, I did not gain any experience from the former small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, how to have a group meeting is still a difficult problem to me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many among you have attended three terms of training, have worked in the communities for a year and a half, and have experienced much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would like to listen to your fellowship.</S>
