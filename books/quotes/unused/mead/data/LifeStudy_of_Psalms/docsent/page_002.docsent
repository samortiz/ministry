   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Psa 1:2, 6; 2:6-7, 12; Luke 24:44</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a recent conference, there were four main points which I would like us to take note of in this introductory word to the Psalms:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 The economy of God is to bring forth an organism for His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 The law in the economy of God is to be used by God for exposing the sinful nature and evil deeds of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 The grace in the economy of God is God's embodiment for man to receive to be his enjoyment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 The issue of the experience of grace in the economy of God is the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I praise the Lord for His sovereign arrangement in allowing us to have this conference with these four main points before we begin our life-study of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Psalms we will see these four main points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first psalm is concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>David did not know the real function of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He likened himself, as one who delighted in the law, to a tree growing beside streams of water and flourishing all the time v. 3 . But after Psalm 1, there is Psalm 2 concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then there is Psalm 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The heading of Psalm 3 says, "A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one who enjoyed the law as the streams of water by which he grew became a kind of exile due to the rebellion of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This happened to David because of his murder of Uriah and his taking of Uriah's wife 2 Sam 12:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one who enjoyed the law so much in Psalm 1 became an intentional murderer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does this show that the law works?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law does work, but not in David's way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law works to expose us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law exposed David to the uttermost as one who conspired to kill Uriah and rob Uriah of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Does the law work or not?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to say that the law works, not according to David's concept in Psalm 1, but according to the apostle Paul's teaching in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul pointed out that the law was something added to the central line of the divine revelation to expose man's sinful nature and wicked deeds Rom 3:20b; 5:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need this view of the law in order to understand the Psalms according to the divine concept in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not in the Old Testament as David was, but we are in the New Testament.</S>
