   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW POINTS REQUIRING PERSONAL ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As teachers of Truth Lessons, we need to pay attention to this one thing: we should not dress sloppily; rather, we should dress neatly and properly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to dress as if we are delivering gifts to people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today even a salesperson dresses in a presentable way when he contacts his clients.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not tuck in our shirt and do not wear a tie when we bring a meeting to people s homes, they will think that the meeting we bring is not valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mormonism is a big heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, the Mormons believe that the Lord Jesus was born of Adam and Mary, and they also advocate polygamy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet their way of preaching is very clever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems that everything the Lord has led us to do in Taiwan has been stolen by them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They go out two by two, visiting people from house to house, bringing the meeting to people s homes, and teaching people how to begin a meeting at home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The most impressive thing is that all of their young people are in suits and are neat and tidy, giving people a very positive impression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not smoke or drink.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither do they drink coffee or tea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They can gain people because they have this kind of outward appearance and a clever way of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently, in my visits to different places, I noticed that some of the brothers neither wore a tie nor a proper shirt when teaching Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to sell our diamond cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not believe that anyone who sells diamonds would not wear a proper shirt and tie.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we do not have any dress regulation or requirement, I hope that all the ones responsible for the truth classes will dress properly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the full-time training, I once told the trainees that the colors of their shoes and their socks did not match, and the color of their ties also did not match.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They needed to learn how to dress properly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, we also need to dress appropriately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not properly attired, people will not be interested in us and will not believe what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we need to give people a feeling that we are proper and serious; moreover, we need to speak appropriately.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then people will think that we are weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true when we attend meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should all dress in a serious manner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today there is a heretical group in the Philippines that teaches people that Jesus Christ is not God, though they say He is a supreme human being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, this group is very successful in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason is that their meetings are orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every attendant dresses properly, as if he were attending a banquet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The ushers wear nice uniforms, not extravagant ones but very proper ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The area outside their compound is very messy, like all the streets in general.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, once one enters their compound, everything is orderly and regulated, and there are even attendants in the parking lot directing cars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In their meetings they exhort people to behave well, to be polite, moral, and loyal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not have much content in their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They mainly teach people to be diligent and not slothful, to be honest and not tell lies, and to do everything by being punctual and by abiding by the rules.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many highly educated people agree with them, and many rich people like to hire members who belong to their group.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thirty years ago they had a membership of one million, and now they have four million.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They surely are heretical, but because of their proper outward practice, they are very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I look at the situation of other groups and then consider the situation among us in the Lord s recovery, my heart truly aches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please allow me to speak a frank word, for I do have the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a training I held here thirty years ago, I spoke on thirty character points.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I also built a simple, plain workers home, but everything in it was orderly even the plants were well trimmed and tidy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After I left for America and handed the home over to your care, it deteriorated year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Several times when I came back to Taiwan, I felt that the construction of hall one was good but that it had not been used properly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The entrance is not presentable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The books on the shelves are not tidy; some are worn out, and some have missing pages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please consider this: If some educated ones who have a heart to seek the Lord, and who occupy high positions in society, came here, would they want to join us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have erred in the Lord s work and misrepresented the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not asking that we build magnificent meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our meeting halls should be simple, clean, tidy, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that the co-workers, elders, and full-timers would have a change in concept.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the Taiwanese society has advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The shop fronts and restaurants have changed their appearances.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, we also cannot stay the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should neither be as crude and simple as in the past nor should we be fashionably extravagant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must realize that we are representing the Lord to bring diamonds and gems to people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are bringing truth, life, and the Spirit to God s children and God s chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we should have a certain appearance, especially in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, as teachers and leading ones in the meetings, we should pay attention to our speaking in public.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our natural man does not pay attention to speaking, so we need some adjustment and practice in this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should practice speaking to ourselves in front of a mirror at home and improve our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since we have received a commission to teach Truth Lessons, we should learn how to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In particular, we should pay attention to our tone and speed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes we need to speak loudly; at other times we need to speak softly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes we need to speak fast, and at other times we need to speak slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, even though we may have spoken much, people still may not understand what we have said.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that for the sake of the Lord s testimony, we all will learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>THE NEED FOR A CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the Lord wills, I will gradually hold more trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the past I have held trainings in the big meetings and for the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, I feel sorry that these trainings were failures because the co-workers did not practice accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have a vast amount of spiritual assets in the Lord s recovery, yet our work has not been effective.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is because we have not paid attention to our appearance, and we do not have a practice that represents us well.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, we cannot break through in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The heretical group in the Philippines tripled its number in three years; however, our number has not increased; on the contrary, it has decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have the truth and life, but because our method is inappropriate, we lack a proper practice to represent us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since we have brought in the loose character of the Chinese, we are now in our current situation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Please bear with me in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today in Taiwan, people in the industrial, commercial, political, military, and academic fields are aggressively making changes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They discard old things and adopt new things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They are not the same as they were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that all the churches can have a big change, including the change of system that I introduced.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Because of our weak foundation, our work will be quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I myself am not able to personally lead us in every detail.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I hope that we all will seriously pay attention to what I have fellowshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What I have shared is not merely related to changing our method of teaching Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I want us to see that meetings for the teaching of the truth are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the truth classes are carried out in a good way, all the other aspects of our work will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The foundation of the entire church is the home meetings, and the key to successful home meetings is the teaching of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we are successful in establishing these two meetings, we will be able to spread to the communities, towns, and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We cannot rely on big meetings in which one person speaks and everyone else listens.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the big gospel meetings that we have held in stadiums, we gained quite a number of people, but in the end only a few remained.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now we must concentrate on the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When the saints coordinate together to go door-knocking, the result is better than that of the big gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Presently the full-time trainees go door-knocking twice a week in the communities; later they will propagate in the towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we continue to labor in this way, we will give the Lord a way to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must clearly see that the change of system is intended to be a thorough change, a complete change.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The change of system will enable the saints to have good habits and good character.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>For example, they will not dress casually for the meetings, but they will dress neatly and properly.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When they go door-knocking, they will not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Because we have neglected our outward appearance in the past and did not pay attention to a wise practice that could represent us, we encountered difficulty in every step of our propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The truths are here like a pile of diamonds, but we have treated them as if they were dung.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is the reason people do not recognize them as diamonds and do not want them.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Now we need a big change to turn everything around so that people will see the diamonds and come for them.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I beseech that we pray much concerning the burden of this message and to ask the Lord for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We need to call on the Lord and tell Him that we truly need His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In the past He gave us so many rich truths, but if we do not give Him the way today, He will not have a way to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May the Lord turn us absolutely and have mercy on us so that we will not receive His riches and grace in vain.</S>
