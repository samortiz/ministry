<h2 class=head2>C. The Gifts to the Church—Some Apostles</h2><p>[The ascended Head gave four kinds of gifts. The first class is the apostles (Eph. 4:11). These apostles receive the revelation of God’s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church (Matt. 16:16-18; Gal. 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph. 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32). First, they receive the revelation, and the revelation makes their spirits burning and causes them to forget about themselves. They then go out to preach the revelation that others may also be burned. These apostles also preach the gospel of Christ to save the sinners chosen and called by God, bringing them to Christ (Gal. 1:16a; Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 11:2). They do not preach the superficial gospel, one that tells people about going to heaven instead of hell; rather, they preach to others the all-inclusive Christ as the gospel. Furthermore, the apostles are able to establish local churches and to appoint in them the elders for leading, shepherding, teaching, and overseeing (Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:2). They are also able to determine doctrines, to release the truth, to perfect the saints, and to build up the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 2:7; Eph. 4:11-12). These are the four things that an apostle should do.]<h2 class=head2>D. The Gifts to the Church—Some Prophets</h2><p>[The prophets are the second class of gifts given by the ascended Christ (Eph. 4:11). The prophets are those who through the Lord’s revelation, speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, and speak the Lord into others. Sometimes they are also moved to utter some predictions. For the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ, they are second only to the apostles and are a very important class of people.]<h2 class=head2>E. The Gifts to the Church—Some Evangelists</h2><p>[The evangelists are the third class of persons given by the ascended Head. They can preach Christ and the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to save the desolate sinners, bringing them to Christ.]<h2 class=head2>F. The Gifts to the Church— Some Shepherds and Teachers</h2><p>[The shepherds and teachers are the fourth class of persons given by the ascended Head. According to the grammatical structure in Greek, the shepherds and teachers here refer to one class of gifted persons. The shepherds should know how to teach others, and the teachers should also know how to feed others. They are able to shepherd and teach the believers and are also able to feed the new ones in the same way that a mother feeds, shepherds, leads, and teaches her children.]<h2 class=head2>G. For the Perfecting of the Saints unto the Work of Ministry unto the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>[The four classes of persons—the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers—preach the gospel to save others on the one hand. On the other hand, they raise up churches in the localities. Then they also feed, shepherd, and teach the saints. Furthermore, among these saints they speak for the Lord and speak the Lord into them. In this way all the saints are perfected. The meaning of perfecting can be illustrated by university students being taught by professors of different subjects. After four years of studying, they graduate and are able to do the same things that the professors do; they have all been perfected. Christ as the Head gave these four kinds of gifts to the church for the purpose of perfecting the saints that the latter may also be the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. Unfortunately this is not the case in the existing system of Christianity. It only trains some preachers to gather a congregation on Sunday for a service where one speaks and the rest listen. Most of them after listening for decades still have not received much perfecting.
