<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The White Stone</H2><P>"I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it" (2:17). Both the hidden manna and the white stone refer to the individual hidden experiences, but the former points to how the believers love the Lord, while the latter points to how the Lord loves the believers. In the ancient times, when the people supported and elected a person, his name was written on a white stone and placed in a jar. This was the ancient method of voting. In the same way, the Lord's beloved believers have their names written on a white stone. Hence, the white stone speaks of the Lord's love and devotion to the individual believers. The two things are related and cannot be separated. The basis of the Lord's love for the believers is the believers' love for Him. We have seen the secretive nature of the hidden manna. In the same way, the white stone is also secretive in its nature because the name written on the stone is a new name, "which no one knows except he who receives it." Hence, this secret is strictly guarded. Only two parties know of this name, the Lord and His believer. Other than the giver and the receiver, no one else can put his hand on this. This is a personal secret between the Lord Himself and His faithful believers. It is not known to outsiders. This holy and private love can only be enjoyed by the lovers of the Lord alone and cannot be touched or understood by outsiders. Men like Antipas, who were faithful witnesses unto death, were true overcomers and were undoubtedly the ones who will receive the white stone. Many times we are weak because we do not have the confidence that we will receive the Lord's reward. Those who are close to the Lord and who have tasted the hidden manna will know the Lord's mind and will receive the white stone. This promise enables every sincere lover of the Lord to testify faithfully for the Lord in the face of all oppositions and temptations.</P><P>Do we want such an intimate communication between the Lord and us? What is the hidden name that we will receive? Names are meaningful in the Bible. The Bible often uses a name to denote the characteristics of the person. To know God's name is to know His very self and His nature. A name denotes a person. The Lord will give to every overcomer a new name. It matters little by what name others call us, but we need to pay attention to and be careful about what new name the Lord will give to us. He gave Simon the name Peter and James and John the name Boanerges. In the same way, the apostle followed the Lord's pattern and gave to Joseph the name Barnabas, for he was very good at comforting others. Towards the world we all have our personal names, but towards Christ we also have our distinctive names. These names are not taken by oneself but are given by the Lord. These names signify the characteristics and virtues which the Lord's eyes notice and which please Him. He pays special attention to our suffering for Him in the world, our service to Him in the wilderness. If we please Him in anything, He will give us a new name. The giving of the new name here signifies the commendation and appreciation of the nature and conduct of the ones receiving the name. This is a special association between the Lord and His commended ones. This association speaks of the Lord's appreciation of them. The Lord loves to point out to us what He appreciates in us. The name He gives to us speaks of the thing in us that pleases His heart. We can see this clearly from the Song of Songs. There the bridegroom repeatedly enumerated to the bride what beauty in her was drawing his heart. In the same way, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the apostle also mentioned the virtues he saw in the believers. However, the name received on the white stone is not announced in public. This is an absolute secret between the Lord and His overcomers. Although eternity is long, it will not leak out this secret! Although there are virtues and blessings which everyone shares, the name on the white stone remains a secret. This secret tells us how much the Lord cares for us! Does not our heart rejoice at the thought that in eternity the Lord alone will still be fond of our distinctiveness and hold it to memory? Will not such a secret drive us to pursue and fan into flame our burning love for the Lord?</P><P>This new name speaks of the things that happen in the world. It speaks of the believers' suffering for the Lord in the world and their attitude and spirit in going through these sufferings. This new name signifies the Lord's attention towards what we have experienced. It also signifies the Lord's commendation in private of our attitude and thoughts in the midst of trials. We do not want to blow the trumpet and let others see what we have reserved for Him; the Lord will reward us in private. Everyone will know that we are rewarded, but they will not know with what and by what we will be rewarded. Others will see us receiving the white stone, but they will not know the name written on the white stone. Even if they see it, they will not be able to understand it if they search into it, because it will be a secret. For one thousand overcomers, there are one thousand different experiences. The Lord will note all the one thousand special characteristics. Since others have different experiences from what I have, and since the Lord's appreciation differs for different people, others will not know even if they see it. Those who know the meaning of the name must have gone through the experiences signified by the name. What we suffer for the Lord is distinctive. According to our distinctiveness the Lord will give us a distinctive name. This being the case, how can those who never have our experience understand this name? We will receive the publicly acclaimed reward, but this new name will have a deeper meaning. In eternity, among the millions of saints, we will hold a secret personal understanding with the Lord. What a thought this is!</P><P>What one dreads the most in human love is to be "common." What one desires the most is singularity. All love demands total commitment. Love does not want to share itself in public. Love requires special treatment from the object of love. One who treats everyone the same has no intimate friends. The Lord loves us. As such He requires total commitment. He does not want us to divide our heart and to love someone else or to love Him in a common way. He has a loving heart; hence, He demands singleness. If believers are zealous in loving Him, they will demand special treatment also. But then, how can He give up everyone and love only one? Yet this is where the greatness of the Lord lies! He has a heart that can love all the believers. Yet He can have an individual and special appreciation and commendation towards every single one of them. This kind of affiliation is absolutely confidential and is not known to outsiders. Does not our heart burn within us when we consider that we have a special place in the Lord's heart and that we are related to Him in a special way that is not possessed by nor known to myriads of other believers? Does it not seem that the Lord is for us and us alone?</P><P>Should we not pursue after the Lord's pleasure? What can compare with this in the world? Do we give up the eternal, priceless joy just for the present, meager, unsatisfying world? Will not such a turnabout amaze us? Why should we who are God's Nazarites and who have received His boundless grace make friends with the world and squander away His eternal, special love for the carob pods which the hogs are eating? Why do we not give up everything of the world to gain the mark of Christ's love instead? Why are we so cold and so reluctant to receive the secret that is only shared with Christ alone? Oh that we would be overcomers to receive this! But then, what is it to overcome? May each one of us ask the Lord this question.</P>
