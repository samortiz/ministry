   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Intention and the Outcome</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we search the Bible for judgment and settlement upon some teaching, we must not only check the intention of our heart, but we must also take heed to the direction in which this kind of teaching leads and the outcome it produces.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, someone said that the Bible never prohibits Christians from smoking opium.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said, "If you say that Christians should not smoke opium, please prove it from the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Undoubtedly, the Bible does not have clearly written statements prohibiting the smoking of opium.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we must take note of the outcome that this kind of saying will bring to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only thing this teaching will do is lead men into the world and to fulfill their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another example is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some think that immersion is right, but sprinkling is also right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They give many reasons for their position.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But these reasons simply reveal that man can change God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, if anyone says that there can be the church in a house besides the church in a locality, we will also ask, What will be the outcome of this kind of teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Could there be any other outcome than that of men within a locality having the freedom in the flesh to break the unity of the church and to lead God's children into the way of divisions?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If in one locality there can be many "house" churches, with all having their own administration and thinking that they are one spiritually, are they not deceiving themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we maintain this kind of teaching, how many more divisions will result in a locality, divisions under the name of so-called "house" churches?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At present there are already scores of denominational churches, but if "house" churches are scriptural, there will be hundreds more churches in one locality!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is this something that a person who has consecrated himself to the Lord and who loves the Lord would want to see?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all know there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout history, past and present, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because there is only one Head, there is only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is a Body with life; thus, it is not right to divide it for any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must stress this: The church is one because the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Any excuse to divide the church is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Division is sin, because it is a "division in the body" 1 Cor 12:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the church is one, it is impossible for all the brothers to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Time and space prevent all the brothers around the whole world from meeting together all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Besides this, it is impractical as far as church administration, supervision, and management are concerned for all the brothers to come together in one world church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God's Word not only permits but also ordains that the church be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to practically make the church singular become the churches plural , God has established the way for one individual church and another individual church to remain two churches instead of one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the principle of "locality" as revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible no church is bigger than the locality; neither is any church smaller than the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever people gather and dwell together, there is a "locality."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A locality is where people gather and dwell together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as a locality is a place where people gather and dwell together, it is the boundary of the church according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People who dwell together in one locality can be independent of other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not a matter of the number of people believers , but a matter of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The basis for separation is not love or lack of love, but locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The basis for God allowing the church to be separated is locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any other kind of separation is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We commit sin if we are separated from our brothers for any other reason than that of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible the only kind of distinction that does not touch upon the nature of the church is the distinction of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The distinction of locality is God's great wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am in Shanghai and you are in Soochow, but when we both come to Nanking, we will not create any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other than the boundary of locality, there absolutely should be no other boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church God only allows us to separate by the principle of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Undoubtedly the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How then can there be many churches?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The distinction can only be on the basis of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because we have our physical body, we are naturally limited by geographical boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Any difference because of names, human feelings, or other factors is harmful to the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only the distinction of locality does not touch the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way, no one can turn away from the general ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may be able to do many things, but we are not qualified to establish a church as we like.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we see that the ground of the church is local, there will be no more reason for the existence of any sects.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The matter of locality cuts man's flesh to the deepest part.</S>
