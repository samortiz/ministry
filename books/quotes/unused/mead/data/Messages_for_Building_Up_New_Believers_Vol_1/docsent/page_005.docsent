   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Achieving the Objectives</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In delivering a lesson, the main goal is not to help the new believers understand more teachings but to do some carving work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One should pay attention to the areas that require carving; he should know what needs to be torn down and what needs to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These lessons should serve as tools to build up the believers and to make new persons out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, in order to achieve the desired objective, the leading ones first must be dealt with in the area they are speaking about.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, their speaking will not be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They will only speak vain words, and these words will be powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone who is responsible for the new believers meeting should pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dividing Up the Classes</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a church has very few new believers or if there are not enough speakers, there is no need to divide the new believers into classes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In such cases one person should simply bear the responsibility of teaching these lessons, followed by questions, week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if a church has many new believers, these believers should be divided into smaller classes and should be trained separately.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Division of classes can be according to geography or level of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Adjust according to the local practical need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is an adequate number of leaders, the classes can range from a few persons to perhaps a dozen or so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In dividing up the classes, one should pay attention to the following points:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paying Attention to the Students</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose one class has a relatively high standard of literacy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should arrange to have stronger ones teach such a class.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If another class consists of those with a lower standard of literacy, the leading one in the class should be experienced in teaching the truth in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we have the right kind of students for the right teachers, the leading ones will not find it difficult to teach, and the audience will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Not Using the Textbook</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In some places only the leaders have the book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this case everyone in the audience should carry a notebook and write down the crucial points and the subject of every portion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In some classes the new believers may be illiterate or semi-literate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such circumstances there is no need to pass out the book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The leading one should pick out at least one crucial verse and read it to the audience again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He should also ask them to repeat it after him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then he should explain the main points of the lesson to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should ask them if they understand the lesson and give them the opportunity to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Using the Textbook</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In places where the textbook is used, everyone should be given a copy during the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leader should help the new believers read the lesson together or take turns reading it section by section.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The leading one should ask questions as he moves along, and the listeners should also feel free to ask questions as they listen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes the listeners can be asked to say something, but their speaking has to be brief and should not occupy too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will make the meeting more lively.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Try your best to avoid lectures or sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who can take notes should prepare a notebook and write down the important points throughout the course of the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Time</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every meeting should be limited to one and a half hours.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The meeting should not drag on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Things to Pay Attention to in</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Speaking, Asking, and Answering Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our voices should be loud enough for the whole class to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not stray off the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Examples or stories must fit the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is best to speak the main points in a clear way according to the text of the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not take advantage of the occasion to speak what you want to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not go off on a tangent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not sermonize, but mix your speaking with questions.</S>
