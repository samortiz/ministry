The second question Brother Lee asked yesterday was how one can tell the difference between his motive and his spirit. Many Bible translators use the word heart instead of spirit in Luke 9:55. Some may think that the spirit here refers to a man's attitude. They think that to be right in spirit is actually to be right in attitude. But there is a big difference between spirit and attitude.</p><p>Attitude issues from motives in the heart. What then is the difference between one's spirit and his motive? Before a man is saved, he can have motives in his heart, but he does not have a spirit. A believer has motives, and he also has a spirit. It is easy for a saved person's spirit to be affected by the motives in his heart. We have said that man's spirit is neutral. A young man has to pass through thirty years of his Christian life before he realizes that his spirit is neutral. The longer you are a Christian, the more you will realize that your spirit is neutral; it has no characteristic of its own. It draws its characteristics from your very person. The spirit is neutral; it is like pure water. When you add different things to water, it assumes the characteristics of the added elements. Suppose you add soy sauce to water; the water will assume the characteristics of soy sauce. The same can be said about the human spirit. Different persons have different characteristics in their spirit. The spirit that God has given us is the same. However, our spirit becomes impure when it is released because we have impure motives in our heart. If our motive is for ourselves or for our own future and business, this motive will taint our spirit, and our spirit will carry the characteristic of this motive. The Lord said to the disciples that their spirit was wrong; their spirit was different from His. The Lord does not want anyone to die from his sins. The Son of Man came not to destroy, but to save.</p><p>The world is a strange place. No one in this world has the kind of feeling the Lord has for human life. Everyone in this world is selfish in his motive. Suppose you cannot rank first in school. When the one who ranks first in school goes into the hospital to have an operation, you want to see him die. Should this man die just because he is more intelligent than you are? Such things are commonplace in politics. If a man cannot climb to a high position, he would rather see his political opponents die. When business competition becomes fierce, some also wish that their competitors' managers would die. The disciples were wrong in their spirit because their motive was one of hatred. The Lord would not allow them to pray the way they wished. The Lord's spirit does not think that anyone deserves to die. This is the reason He said that He came to save, not to destroy. This is the Lord's heart. This is His spirit.</p><p>The disciples were wrong in their heart. This is the reason they were wrong in their spirit. The unbelievers only have a heart; they do not have a spirit. Their heart is hidden within them; it cannot show. But a saved person's spirit can flow out, and his heart can flow out with his spirit. You can guess the motive of an unbeliever from his speaking. But with a Christian, it is not a matter of guessing. Something definite comes out of his being, and all who are experienced can identify it. The heart is hidden within an unsaved person, but a Christian's heart flows out with his spirit. When a Christian's spirit is released, another Christian touches something if he is exercising his spirit. A man can deceive others with his words, but his spirit cannot hide from an experienced person.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> </body></html>
