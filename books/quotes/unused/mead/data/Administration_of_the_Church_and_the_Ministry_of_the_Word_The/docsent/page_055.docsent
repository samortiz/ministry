   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REQUIRING ABSOLUTE DEDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason, those who administrate the church and minister the word cannot be simple persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should dedicate our whole being to what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This can be compared to an experienced engineer who is continually considering the design of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even when he is sleeping, he is considering the design.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, it is not simple for him to design a project.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, it seems as if we consider our service to be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, the responsible brothers usually arrive at the bread-breaking meeting when it is time to start.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They do not consider how to lead the meeting until the meeting has already begun.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is at this moment that they begin to think about choosing a hymn, and one of them looks for a hymn, flipping through the hymnal from page to page.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the hymn is sung, it is followed with a prayer, then the singing of another hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This situation gives the saints the feeling that the leading ones are killing time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the bread and the cup are passed, a brother may then stand up and say that he has something to fellowship, but because he did not spend the time to prepare, no one understands what he is saying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are responsible for the meetings should not feel at peace if there is no supply in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should not be able to eat or sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the time they should be considering how to improve the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They should not be able to sleep peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the proper attitude of those who are responsible for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some complain that there is not enough material to compose a message.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I began serving the Lord, there was no material, and there was no one to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we first held the bread-breaking meeting, we simply broke the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as I considered this matter, I felt that we should abandon the routines of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After much consideration I received light, and we found the way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I spent a long time searching, because I did not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, I considered, Should the prayer meeting be done in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Christians come together to pray, is this the way to do it?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we think in this way, I believe that the Lord will let us know what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The brothers and sisters need to know the meaning of prayer, what to pray for, and how to pray in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This should be according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we need to find something to minister to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do this, the prayer meeting will change, and the number of those attending the meetings will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The saints will enjoy coming to the prayer meeting because they receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This matter requires much thought.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we endeavor, the more living the prayer meeting will become.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A SPECIAL COMMISSION TO THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SERVING IN THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who serve in the ministry of the word should study how to minister the word in the bread-breaking meeting and in the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should minister the word in the prayer meeting without being long or killing the spirit of prayer and disrupting the mood for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, our speaking should strengthen and open the spirit of prayer and stir others up to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is positive if those who do not normally pray would pray after we release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I first went to Manila, the brothers and sisters feared the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting even though these two meetings are the most important in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, I requested the responsible brothers to set up a bread-breaking meeting that would be held in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The responsible brothers felt that no one would come if the meeting was in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I endeavored to adjust them, and eventually the bread-breaking meeting had the best attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Presently, the number of saints attending the bread-breaking meeting in Manila is more than those who attend the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The saints say that it is because there is a supply in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regrettably, I was not able to labor for a long period there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the effect of my labor did not match what we did in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We were successful in northern China because we labored for many years, and we concentrated on only one local church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Manila, however, there were many matters to attend to, and it was not appropriate for me to take over a local church and do the work by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I could serve only as an adviser.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In spite of these reasons, there was still improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should all practice the matters that we have fellowshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not pay attention only to the speaking on the Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should endeavor to uplift the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should also raise the level of the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There must be the supply of the word in these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should study how to supply a specific word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to dig out the gold and find the treasures.</S>
