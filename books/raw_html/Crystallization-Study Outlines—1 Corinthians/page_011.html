<h1 class="title">Christ Becoming the Life-giving Spirit<br />
through Resurrection</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45b, 10, 58;<br />
Phil. 1:19; Exo. 30:23-25</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul dealt with the Corinthians&rsquo; heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead; we must see that resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy&mdash;v. 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The three major items of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection are the birth of the firstborn Son of God, the regeneration of the many sons of God, and Christ as the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit; the entire economy of God is carried out by these three items&mdash;Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The firstborn Son of God is the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18), the many sons of God are the members of the Body (John 12:24; Rom. 8:29), and the life-giving Spirit is the reality and life of the Body (John 14:17; Eph. 4:4).</li>
		<li>Without these major items of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, there would be no church, no Body of Christ, and there would be no economy of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not of the living&mdash;Matt. 22:32.</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead; He would be a dead Savior, not a living One who lives forever (Rev. 1:18) and is able to save to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25).</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of our being justified by His death (Rom. 4:25), no imparting of life (John 12:24), no regeneration (3:5), no renewing (Titus 3:5), no transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), and no conformity to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29).</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (12:5), no Body of Christ as His fullness (Eph. 1:20-23), and no church as Christ&rsquo;s bride (John 3:29), and therefore no new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11).</li>
	<li>If there were no resurrection, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God&rsquo;s eternal purpose would be nullified.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In incarnation Christ became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29); then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the impartation of life to make us men of life (10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through and in His resurrection, Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers to flow out as rivers of living water&mdash;John 7:37-39; Rev. 21:6; 22:17.</li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, comprising all the elements of Jesus&rsquo; humanity with His death and Christ&rsquo;s divinity with His resurrection, which become the bountiful supply of the unsearchable Christ for the support of His believers&mdash;Phil. 1:19b.</li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit, typified by the compound anointing ointment with its ingredients&mdash;Exo. 30:23-25; 1 John 2:20, 27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Olive oil signifies the Spirit of God with divinity:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Olive oil is the base of the compound ointment, the holy anointing oil&mdash;Isa. 61:1-2; Heb. 1:9.</li>
			<li>Olive oil, produced by the pressing of olives (cf. Matt. 26:36), is for the priesthood and the kingship to proclaim the jubilee of grace&mdash;Lev. 8:12; 1 Sam. 16:12-13; Luke 4:18-19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Myrrh was used to reduce pain and heal the body when it gave off the wrong kind of secretion&mdash;Mark 15:23; John 19:39.</li>
			<li>The Spirit was compounded through Christ&rsquo;s sufferings in His living a crucified life, a life of myrrh, from the manger to the cross as the first God-man&mdash;Matt. 2:11; John 19:39; Isa. 53:2-3.</li>
			<li>The Spirit leads us to the cross, the cross is applied by the Spirit, and the cross issues in more abundance of the Spirit&mdash;Heb. 9:14; Rom. 6:3, 6; 8:13-14; Gal. 2:20; John 12:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Cinnamon was used to stimulate a weak heart&mdash; Neh. 8:10; Isa. 42:4a.</li>
			<li>We are conformed to the death of Christ by our outward, consuming environment in cooperation with the indwelling, crucifying Spirit&mdash; 2 Cor. 4:10-11, 16; Rom. 8:13-14; Gal. 5:24; Col. 3:5; Gal. 6:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Calamus is a reed standing up (shooting into the air) and growing in a marsh or muddy place&mdash;1 Pet. 3:18.</li>
			<li>We need to experience the Spirit as the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;John 11:25; 20:22; Lam. 3:55-57.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Cassia signifies the repelling power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Cinnamon is from the inner part of the bark, and cassia, from the outer part&mdash;Rev. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:24; John 11:25.</li>
			<li>Cassia was a repellent to drive away insects and snakes&mdash;Eph. 6:11, 17b-18.</li>
			<li>We need to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in the life-giving Spirit as the all-sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 12:9-10; 1 Cor. 15:10, 45b, 58; Phil. 4:23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is the Lord Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, for the metabolic transformation of the believers and for the growth and building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17-18; 1 Cor. 3:6, 9b, 12a; Eph. 4:16b.</li>
	<li>Without Christ being the life-giving Spirit, we cannot experience anything of God in His economy&mdash;1 John 5:6; John 16:13; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2:10; 6:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection&mdash;15:10, 45b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The grace that motivated the apostle and operated in him was a living person, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;John 1:17; Gal. 2:20-21; cf. 1 Cor. 15:10.</li>
	<li>His ministry and living by this grace were an undeniable testimony to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;vv. 8-10, 31, 58.</li>
	</ol></li>
