   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD S PURPOSE BEING HIS BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS CHOSEN PLACE OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Eph 5:32; Matt 16:18; Eph 2:22; 4:3-6; Deut 12:11-14, 17-18; John 4:24 CREATION, REDEMPTION, AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our God is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the great God with a great purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see what this purpose is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the sixty-six books of the Bible we can find only one unique purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is true that God has done many things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, God created the heavens and the earth with millions of items, but His purpose was not creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Old Testament the first thing we see is God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in the New Testament the first thing we see is God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has gone on from His creation to His redemption, but neither creation nor redemption is God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Creation is wonderful, and redemption is even more wonderful, but neither of these two wonderful things is God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, from redemption God is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The goal in the Bible, as revealed at the end, is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The consummation of all the sixty-six books of the Bible is the holy city, the New Jerusalem Rev 21 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This city is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, God s purpose, His goal, is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first two chapters of the Bible we see creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the last two chapters of the Bible we see a building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Creation is at the beginning, and the building is at the end. Between creation and building is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without creation there is no beginning, without the building there is no end, and without redemption there is nothing to bridge the long gap between creation and building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Redemption is a long bridge between the two ends of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we are on the bridge of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We came from God s creation, we were redeemed, and now we are going on under His redemption toward the goal of building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Creation, redemption, and building are three great matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 1:1a says, In the beginning God created.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Creation initiated everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every one of us began in Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s creation included all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of our age, we were all created in Genesis 1 when Adam was created.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We began to have our being not from our father and mother but from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Adam breathed, we all breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all appreciate redemption, but we may think that creation was something related only to Adam, not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we think that our source is our father, we must then ask where our father came from.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we must ask from what source our grandfather came.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we continue in this way, we will eventually trace our source back to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all began from God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After creation we became fallen and lost, but then we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank God for His redemption!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament and even more in the New Testament we can see this precious, great matter of God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the Bible does not end with creation, and neither does it end with redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, the Bible ends with another great matter building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE MATTER OF BUILDING BEING REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the first book of the New Testament, one day the Lord Jesus suddenly revealed the matter of building to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter first saw that Jesus was the Christ of God and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter must have been excited to receive this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus asked the disciples, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The disciples told Him, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets v. 14 . Then the Lord Jesus asked the disciples, Who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Peter had the boldness to answer, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Jesus said, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>17-18a .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that the Lord was saying, Peter, you received the revelation concerning Christ, but you also need to see that Christ is for something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have seen Christ, but I also tell you that I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, I will build My church upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have seen that I am the Christ of God, but you must also see that I am for My church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as you have seen the Christ, you surely need to know My church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ and the church are the great mystery Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way the Lord Jesus revealed the matter of building to Peter and the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The three great apostles Peter, Paul, and John all saw the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Peter s first Epistle he tells us, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Ephesians Paul tells us, You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Revelation John shows us God s ultimate building, the New Jerusalem 3:12; 21:2, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, it is clear that God s goal is His building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today He is on the way, which began from His creation, passes through His redemption, and eventually will reach His building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We came from creation, we are in redemption, and we are going on to building.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is truly wonderful.</S>
