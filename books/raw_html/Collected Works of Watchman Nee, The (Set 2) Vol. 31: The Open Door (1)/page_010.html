<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chai Tze-chung, Fukien Province</h2><p>Peace to my beloved brothers, Watchman and Tsi-yi:</p><p>Through reading The Open Door I have come to know a little about the situation among the brothers. Thank you. On September 22-24 Brother Ke-san, Jai-seng, and I prayed in one accord for the work in Foochow, Pu-Tien, and Sien-You. On the twenty-fifth Brother Tsai-seng went to Fu-Ching via Han-Chiang. I went to Sien-You from Pu-Tien, and Brother Ke-san conducted a Bible study in Pu-Tien. Brother Ke-san is still conducting a Bible study in Pu-Tien. Brother Jai-seng went from Fu-Ching to Dung-Jang. Brothers Chen Bing-hsi and Jung Chun-geng went with him. I heard that the Lord did some marvelous work there. After I left Sien-You, I remained in Feng-Ting for two days and returned to Pu-Tien on October 25. The Lord has been guiding us through all these endeavors, and we thank Him for His grace. Grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Chai Tze-chung<br />October 29<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Tang Shou-ling,<br />Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear sister in the Lord:</p><p>The work around Shao-Shing has witnessed God's marvelous grace. The Lord has brought us safely through the meetings in Shao-Cheng, Hwa-She, and Wan-An-Chiao. Before us still lie Ji-Shan-Chiao, Shi-Ur-Dai (of the China Inland Mission), and Si-Shing. These meetings will be concluded in two weeks. We hope that the Lord will do greater things and that myself and all the brothers and sisters in various places will receive the benefit. Peace be to you.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />November 1, in transit<br />(Since the war reached Wu-Kang, we have lost contact with Brother Tang's family. We do not know where Brother Tang is. We hope those who know where he is will immediately inform us of his whereabouts&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chiu Ri-jien,<br />Kiangsu Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi, beloved in the Lord:</p><p>I have not corresponded with you for a long time because I did not know your address. I found out where you are only after receiving Brother Nee's open letter (in The Open Door) yesterday. Enclosed please find X dollars as an offering for the brothers who have lost their jobs through the fighting in Shanghai. The amount is small and serves merely to show the fulfillment of our duty. Please give my greetings to Brother Nee and thank him for not forgetting me. Although I live in Soo-Jia-Tsui, I sometimes travel to the two inland counties of Lian-Shui and Hwai-An. I also work in the region of Fu-Ning County. The past spring Brother Ji and I worked in Nan-Shu-Jou, Ling-Bi County, and Si-Jou in Anhwei province for a month or two. Recently, I have been working more often in the city of Lian-Shui. Please pray for this city. We are all well here. Thank Him for His grace. If you have the time, please tell us about your condition and the condition of your church. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>A young one in the Lord,<br />Chiu Ri-jien<br />[Address omitted]</p>
