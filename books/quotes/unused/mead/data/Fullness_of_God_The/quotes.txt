[1]  In this series of messages we will use four chapters to consider the fullness of God and another four chapters to consider life, truth, the church, and the gospel.
[2]  According to common understanding, faith means to believe, to depend on, and to trust in, but in the New Testament, faith means to receive.
[3]  By the Lord s power I was saved when I was nineteen, and the Lord planted within me a heart that loves the Bible.
[4]  It was not until the last twenty-five years that I began to understand the difference between the fullness of God and the riches of God.
[5]  The riches of a wealthy man are in his abundance of money, and the riches of a wealthy farmer are in his abundance of land.
[6]  There are the riches of God s grace Eph 1:7 , the riches of God s glory v. 18; 3:16; Rom 9:23 , and the riches of God s kindness, forbearance, and long-suffering 2:4 .
[7]  However, it was not until the Lord Jesus was incarnated, that is, when God was expressed through Jesus Christ, that human beings could see God.
[8]  His love was the love of God, His mercy was the mercy of God, and His compassion was the compassion of God.
[9]  Some of the new believers may wonder how the fullness of God is related to them.
[10]  Hence, man was created for the fullness of God.
[11]  If we all receive this word, we will realize that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we did not receive a philosophy or religion, neither did we learn a different kind of ritual for worship.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE Scripture Reading: John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 2:20
[13]  Prayer: Lord, in coming to Your Word, we are coming before You.
[14]  By 1935 I had been saved for ten years and was serving the Lord full time.
[15]  The Bible reveals that Christ wants to be our life John 10:10 .
[16]  John said, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life 1 John 5:12 , and Paul said, Christ our life Col 3:4 .
[17]  Eventually, as I experienced Christ and read the Bible, I discovered that the key, the secret, to taking Christ as our life is absolutely in the spirit.
[18]  Brother Nee helped us to see according to Romans 8 that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ and that the Spirit of Christ, who is Christ Himself, is the Spirit of life.
[19]  BEING FOR THE FULLNESS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:9; 1:19; John 1:14, 16; Heb 1:3; John 1:12-13; 2 Pet 1:4; Eph 3:19 OUTLINE The fullness of God dwelling in Christ bodily Col 2:9; 1:19: The fullness of God s grace and reality being in Christ John 1:14.
[20]  The believers having received of Christ s fullness, and grace upon grace v. 16.
[21]  The believers being redeemed for God s expression: The believers being redeemed back to humanity s position at creation.
[22]  When God s riches overflow from within us, we become His fullness; we become the expression of God.
[23]  If we read Ephesians 3 carefully, we will see that the phrase unto all the fullness of God in verse 19 refers to the church.
[24]  Christians who are cold and do not pursue the Lord in their daily life, but only worship Him on the Lord s Day, are not filled.
[25]  In 3:16-19 he desperately prayed for the saints: That He would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[26]  If we are filled with God s life, love, and light, we will sing joyfully as we walk into the meeting hall, and everyone in our meetings will sing, praise, testify, and say Amen.
[27]  There is only one God, and the Bible shows that when the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He was God manifested in the flesh John 1:1, 14 .
[28]  John 1:16 says, Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
[29]  Based on this light, when we read the record of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, we need to see that His life and walk were not merely rich in life, love, and power; His life and walk were the fullness of life, love, and power.
[30]  The believers are also redeemed to become the children of God who possess the divine life and the divine nature in order to express God and become the fullness of God John 1:12-13; 2 Pet 1:4; Eph 3:19 .
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR THE TRUTH BEING OUR FREEDOM Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 17; 8:32, 36; 14:6; 17:17; 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; Titus 1:1 THE LOVE OF GOD PROGRESSING
[32]  In the previous chapter we pointed out that according to John 3:16, when the divine love is in the Father, it is rich, but when it is in the Son, it becomes the fullness.
[33]  The basis for saying this is found in the verse, which reads, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.
[34]  In this verse God s love progresses from the Father to the Son.
[35]  The Bible does not say that God loved the angels, but John 3:16 says, God so loved the world.
[36]  Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment, and reality is God in the Son realized by us.
[37]  When I spoke on the word reality many years ago in Taiwan, I did not give much stress to the matter of teachings.
[38]  I would like to encourage the young brothers and sisters to pay attention to the crucial matter of taking Christ as life after our salvation.
[39]  In contrast, the Bible as God s word gives a thorough explanation of God who is also hidden in the word as the reality.
[40]  When reading the Bible, it is best not to skip around according to our interest; neither should we read the Bible in a religious way.
[41]  The Bible is the written word of God, and the Lord Jesus is the living word of God.
[42]  AND THE BELIEVERS TRANSFORMATION BEING FOR THE FULLNESS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 4:13; 3:8; Rom 10:12; Eph 3:19; 5:18; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10; 2 Cor 3:18 OUTLINE The church being the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:22-23; 4:13: The church enjoying all the riches of Christ, the riches of God 3:8; Rom 10:12.
[43]  The church becoming the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ and the enlargement of the expression of God in Christ Eph 3:19.
[44]  If you are filled with Christ, I am filled with Christ, and every believer of the Lord Jesus is filled with Christ, then when we gather together, we are the church, the fullness of Christ.
[45]  BEING OUR HOUSE Scripture Reading: Matt 18:16-18, 20; Acts 2:46; 8:1; Eph 1:23; Rev 1:20; 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 10:25
[46]  In the previous chapters we spoke concerning Christ as our life and the truth as our freedom.
[47]  The Chinese Union Version of the Bible translates the living God in 1 Timothy 3:15 as the everlasting God.
[48]  In John 14 the Lord said, In My Father s house are many abodes;...I go to prepare a place for you.
[49]  If we can say that God has found an abode in us, we can surely say that we have found an abode in God.
[50]  The temple of God is the house of God, and the house of God is the temple of God.
[51]  The church is universal, and it is also expressed locally in city after city.
[52]  When we speak in the meetings, we need to obey the Spirit.
[53]  The believers glorification being for God s fullness: The created yet fallen man entering into God s glory through redemption and transformation to become God s fullness for God s expression Rom 8:30, 17-18, 21; 1 John 3:2.
[54]  The New Jerusalem being the aggregate of God s redeemed, matured, and glorified people throughout the ages, the ultimate expression of the riches of all that God is.
[55]  In 1 Corinthians 3:10-15 Paul says, According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.
[56]  But let each man take heed how he builds upon it...If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one s work, of what sort it is.
[57]  These verses show that even before the book of Revelation was written, Paul said that gold, silver, and precious stones are the materials for God s building.
[58]  He used gold, silver, and precious stones as a sign to show that once we are saved, we possess the life of God.
[59]  For over ten years after my salvation, even though I said that I had God s life and nature, I did not have a deep impression of the divine life.
[60]  I had a deep sensation that God is in me and that I was made to contain God.
[61]  When we pray, we breathe in the Spirit, and when we read the Bible, the Spirit of God enters into us, because the Spirit is in the Bible.
[62]  In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul says that we should build with precious stones.
[63]  We can say that stones are created by God, but precious stones are the product of transformation.
[64]  Before we were saved, we were like a pile of dirt, but we thank the Lord that we are saved.
[65]  He is now secreting His life around us to make us precious pearls so that we can be built into God s eternal expression.
[66]  The Bible speaks about God entering into us to be our element of pure gold, Christ the Son passing through death and resurrection to bring us into His death and to carry out a secreting work within us to make us pearls, and the Spirit transforming us into precious stones.
[67]  Concerning God s life, in the middle of the street in the city flows the river of water of life, bright as crystal 22:1 .
[68]  This means that the church should be full of God s life and light; the church should be the full expression of what God is.
[69]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE GOSPEL BEING OUR LIVING Scripture Reading: Rom 1:14-16; 1 Cor 9:16-17; John 15:1-8, 16
[70]  We have seen that Christ is our life, the truth is our freedom, and the church of the living God is our house.
[71]  The Lord s word in John 15 concerning the vine shows that every believer is a branch in the Lord, who is the vine.
[72]  In relation to preaching the gospel, there are two categories of hymns that we should be familiar with.
[73]  Last, we should grasp the opportunity to preach the gospel to the people around us.
