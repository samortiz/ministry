<h2 class="head2">Lost Lambs in the Wilderness, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>Praise and thank the Lord, although the clouds of war are thick, we have been protected. We are safe, and we can serve the Lord as usual. This is His special grace! The Lord has already opened a door for us for the gospel in the inland region. We have all been led by Him to go inland. Brother Han Jin-siu went to Town 28 in Nan-An. It is a wilderness there, but one family of believers that used to meet in Tung- An moved there. Wang You-yi and Keh Lien-min have gone to Ban-Ling, Hu-Kang, in An-Hsi. There is already an assembly there, but the number of believers is few. Brother Chang Tung-yuan and I arrived in Juang-Shan (Juang-Shan Village in An-Hsi) on November 1. Some brothers have been meeting here by themselves for a long time. When we arrived, we had seven days of meetings for the believers. We really thank the Lord for it. There are many factories in the neighboring areas, and lost sheep are all over the wilderness! We are waiting for the Lord to open the door and lead us. Please pray for us. Rejoice in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Deng-ming<br />November 18, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Sister Bao Hsu-min</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to dear Sister X:</p><p>I left Dong-Chang for Fu-Ching County on the fifteenth of the month. I did not return to Wenchow until yesterday. Tomorrow I will go to Shing-Hwa. The sisters in each assembly really need cultivation. May God raise up and send experienced ones soon. Thank the Father for selecting and calling a sister who loves the Lord and for preparing her to serve Him. This sister is still working in a hospital, waiting for God's leading. God has saved many people through her. May the Father Himself perfect her to be useful to God. 3 John 2.</p><p>Bao Hsu-min<br />December 21, 1937</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise the blessed Father and the gracious Lord who loves us. He really is our joy, glory, and hope! Hallelujah! This week I rested much in Pu-Tien and received much help from Mr. Chen Ke-san. The sisters want to have an edifying conference from next Monday to Saturday. May the Lord send blessing and grace through it. If the Lord is willing, I hope to be able to speak something on the aspect of life in the afternoon, especially concerning pursuit and revelation. Our emphasis will be more on our daily living. Please pray much for this. May the Lord gain what He wants to gain. May He give what He wants to give. Please greet Miss Chang and all the sisters with you. May you rest in the Lord's arms!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />December 28, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p>
