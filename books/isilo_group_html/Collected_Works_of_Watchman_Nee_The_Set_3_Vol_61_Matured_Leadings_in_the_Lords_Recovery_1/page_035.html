A man who has handed himself over naturally has questions concerning his dwelling, living, and employment. He will ask, "What should I do now that I have handed over all my possessions?" This is important because we have not only handed over our possessions, but ourselves, our very person, as well. We have to live for the gospel and for the church. From this point forward, where we live, the job we take, and the future we have must all be determined by the gospel. It is for the brothers and sisters' benefit that we tell them to sell their all. When they sell their all, they can coordinate in the church life, and they can live for the gospel. For example, a student who used to go to school for his own study, after selling his all, must go to school for the purpose of spreading the gospel. Perhaps his last term in school had only one goal&mdash;his own study, but now he has two goals. In the same principle, we are not living in Hong Kong for ourselves but for the sake of the gospel. If the church needs us to go to Sinkiang, we should be able to respond and go. We do not wish to see personal choices here. We do not want to exercise personal freedom.</p><p>Some Chekiang brothers and sisters have migrated from Hangchow to the Yi-Yang region. The Communist Party commended us for this. Recently a group of brothers in Shanghai followed in their footsteps. They did not move there by choice but for the sake of the gospel. There are over two hundred people now living in straw tents. Some saints from the church in Chefoo moved to the northwest some time ago. A Christian lives on the earth for the Lord. Everything is for the Lord and for His gospel. We should be able to find more than just the Christians of past generations forsaking everything for the gospel. In the coming days, we also have to forsake everything for the gospel. Either we will not do it at all, or we must do it properly. We do not want unbelievers to laugh at us. For the sake of the prospering of the gospel, we are willing to go to any length. The responsible brothers have no interest in interfering with your personal business. This only adds to their burden of management. This is not something that we want to do, but we are forced to do it for the gospel's sake. Today there are still brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are ready to be sent to the northwest. They do not want the gospel to stop because of them.</p><p>You have to do the same in Hong Kong. Today there are two million people in Hong Kong. This number will increase. Now we have only a hundred saved ones among us. Even a thousand is too few. If just a tenth of the population in Hong Kong was saved, we would have two hundred thousand people. That is far greater than a thousand people. Your heart must not be satisfied. It is a foolish thing to be satisfied with your present condition. The Lord desires that all men be saved (1 Tim. 2:4). May we all have God's desire. Our view must be enlarged. The Lord's commandment is that we go into all the world to preach the gospel to all creation (Mark 16:15). If we have this heart, it will be easy for us to spread the gospel throughout Hong Kong. But first we need a group of brothers and sisters to hand themselves over in a thorough way. No one should have any reservation for himself. No one should fool himself. If we all do this, other brothers and sisters will be attracted to follow. The responsibility is on our shoulders. We have to rise up to consecrate ourselves first. Eventually, this consecration will spread to the whole church. Unless the whole church rises up to take this way, we will have problems in the church life sooner or later. Some will see the truth and sell their all, while others will not want to give up their possessions. How can there be one accord if this happens? We have to see that the Lord's requirement is high. He requires that we forsake everything. The leading brothers must go on in a proper way and not have any reservations within. Only then will we be able to lead others on.</p><p>You do not have to be afraid. Brother Qu, Brother Lee, and other elder leading brothers are walking ahead of you and taking the lead among you. You have to be led to the point where you realize that no further progress will come unless you sell your all. To be a Christian we have to act decisively. It is meaningless and senseless to be a half-way and indifferent Christian. Brother Witness Lee once said that the church's channels have to be dug deep before water will flow abundantly. We can say the same thing about consecration. The more we consecrate, the more the blessing will come, and the more we will see men saved. The more hesitation we have, the less useful we will be. In every place many saints have experienced this. Once a child of God hands over his all, the gospel breaks forth. When the disciples sold their all in Acts, God added to them daily those who were being saved (2:47). If there is not a single soul in Hong Kong who wavers, who is held back, who keeps his body and possessions, and who lives for himself and if everyone is willing to rise up to serve under the church's direction, I believe there will be great hope in Hong Kong.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
