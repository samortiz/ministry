<P>In doing anything successfully there is a certain principle. You must get the principle and learn it. Do not think that to knock on doors to get people baptized is easy. No, it has its principle. There are principles in learning how to play the piano. Now we are endeavoring to live uniquely for the gospel, and no other way is prevailing but the Lord's new way. This has been proven by Christian history for centuries. We studied many of the practices of the past and tried them. We had many of the books of the leading mystics translated into Chinese close to fifty years ago. We studied nearly all of the leading books of the inner life. I learned a lot from them. I was with the Brethren, and Brother Nee studied many books put out by the Brethren teachers. We even tried some items of the Pentecostal movement and found out that it was not profitable. We must cut off "the tail" of the leaven of Christianity to have a new way, and the new way is fully ordained by God and recorded in the Bible. It is here now for us to practice. We have tried this way, and it works.</P><P>If each one of you would rise up and go out for some time once a week for two or three hours, everyone will get one a month or twelve a year. What an increase we will have! I must be faithful to tell you this. After telling you this, you bear the responsibility. We must visit people to share with them the high gospel, that is, the Triune God Himself to be our life and content.</P><P>Our sharing of the gospel with people is to lead them to believe and be baptized. In the Bible not one who repented and believed was told to wait for some time to be baptized. Every case was that they repented, believed, and were baptized (Acts 8:36-38; 16:14-15, 31-33; 22:16). This is the biblical way. When people repent and believe, that is the right time for you to exercise your authority to authorize their baptism. The Holy Spirit honors this and confirms this. This baptism could never be a ritual. But if you ask people to wait four months and then baptize them, that baptism will become a ritual and not bear any significance in the power of the Spirit. We do not need to wait to get into the meeting hall's baptistery. Right away from the living room, we get them into the bathroom to exercise the power of the Spirit in baptism. What a big difference! If you would take this way and practice faithfully to go out three hours weekly for four weeks a month, I assure you that you can gain one person.</P>
