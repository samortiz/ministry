<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how to preach the gospel. After young people consecrate themselves to serve full time, the first thing they need to do is preach the gospel. However, what is the best way to preach the gospel? When we preach the gospel, our main goal is to be effective. To be effective means to get people saved. If we speak vividly and eloquently, but no one gets saved, our gospel preaching is a failure. Hence, it is crucial for us to learn how to preach the gospel effectively.</p>
<p>Some say that the best way to preach the gospel is to sing hymns. This is not wrong; it is one way to preach the gospel. However, singing hymns as the first step in preaching the gospel can be compared to walking with one&rsquo;s hands. Others say that the best way is to use the booklet <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> which uses four keys to preach the gospel. The key of God&rsquo;s creation unlocks the mystery of human existence, the key of man&rsquo;s fall unlocks the mystery of the two natures of man, the key of Christ&rsquo;s redemption unlocks the mystery of the God-man, and the key of God&rsquo;s dispensing unlocks the mystery of faith. Lastly, it tells a person how to receive the gospel. This is good material for preaching the gospel, but we need to begin preaching the gospel from a basic level.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENERAL WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Person with a Spirit of the Gospel</h2>
<p>We must consider the matter of preaching the gospel from the most basic level. A certain kind of task requires a certain kind of person. If we want to preach the gospel, we must be persons who are for the gospel. As soon as the apostle Paul was saved, he proclaimed Jesus Christ (Acts 9:20-22). This is the first thing that he did. Every serving one, including the New Testament apostles, such as Peter and John, and those throughout church history, such as Moody and Spurgeon, begins his service by preaching the gospel. Every person who is saved and loves the Lord has a spirit of the gospel, the desire to preach the gospel. In particular, those who love the Lord and consecrate themselves to the Lord have a strong desire to preach the gospel. We all must be persons who preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Immediately after I was saved, I felt within that I should preach the gospel. At that time no one was shepherding me. Furthermore, in Chefoo the members in the various denominations were very cold toward preaching the gospel. It seemed as if I was the only person who was zealous for the gospel. I went to the villages to preach the gospel every Lord&rsquo;s Day. Since there were no buses, I walked. I would walk about twenty miles in a day. By the time I returned home, I would be exhausted. Nevertheless, I did not cease preaching the gospel. There was a shortage of gospel material, so there were no gospel tracts for purchase. Hence, I began to write gospel tracts. This spirit of the gospel is in every one of us, but some of us suppress it instead of cultivating it. The spirit of the gospel is like fire that can either be extinguished or set ablaze. Hence, we need to cultivate the spirit of the gospel, and we even need to fan it into flame. The bigger the fire, the better.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying to Kindle the Fire of the Gospel</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, we first must be a person for the gospel, having the spirit of the gospel. Next, we must pray. If we lack prayer, all our labor will be in vain. Therefore, we must pray. However, we should not pray for any specific persons; our prayer should be general. We should pray for the Lord to strengthen the spirit of the gospel within us so that the fire of the gospel would burn among us. Furthermore, we must pray for the Lord to give us a heart of love toward men, to give us a sense of urgency toward the thousands of people who are perishing every day, and especially to give us an interest in sinners and a desire to contact them. This kind of prayer fans the fire of the gospel into flame; the more we pray, the more the fire of the gospel will be burning in us. Eventually, when we see a sinner, we will be moved to tears, and we will love the unbelievers. The young saints should exercise in this way. If we feel nothing in our heart when we see people, the gospel tracts that we give them will be cold. However, if the fire of the gospel is burning within us, we will be burdened when we think of the unbelievers going to the lake of fire. Then every tract that we give out will touch people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>If the fire of the gospel is kindled within us, we will become crazy for the gospel and go everywhere to preach the gospel. The young people should be crazy for the gospel on their college campuses. Whenever they see an unbeliever, they should be enlivened, even to the point that they forget about eating and care only for the gospel. We should distribute gospel tracts and booklets every day. When I was young, there were always gospel tracts in my pocket. On my way to and from work, I would give them to the people I met. We should never be without gospel tracts, and we should give them to everyone we see. Whether we are in a store or eating in a restaurant, we should give out gospel tracts. If we are the kind of people who preach the gospel everywhere, we will see the effect of the gospel. The economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, will be upon us, and we will be full of power in the gospel.</p>
<p>What I have fellowshipped is the common way, the general way to preach the gospel. Every full-time serving one must have this experience. We must be on fire for the gospel, crazy for the gospel, for at least two to three years. All those who are crazy for the gospel will become thick-skinned, bold, not shy. If we have not already learned this spiritual lesson, we must make it up. All the young ones who are serving the Lord full time must be crazy for the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
