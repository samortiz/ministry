   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT 3 Scripture Reading: John 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that today in actuality and practicality for our experience Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the extract of the last Adam, God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now go on to consider the essence of this divine extract.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SON OF THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The greatest argument between the Lord Jesus and the Pharisees in chapter eight of the Gospel of John concerned who the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews said to Him, "Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prophets died too.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whom are you making yourself?" v. 53 . It was difficult for the Lord Jesus to answer this question, because who He is and what He is, are not simple matters and cannot be expressed in simple terms.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to John 8, the Lord Jesus is the Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first element of the divine extract is the Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The One who is the Son of the Father is the Emancipator, the One who sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter it is revealed very clearly that the wonderful Emancipator is the Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father is the unique source.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the source of the divine economy and of all that the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Emancipator, the One who sets us free from the slavery of sin, is the Son of this source.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the expression, the coming forth, of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that the whole world is in darkness and is filled with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Darkness implies sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the darkness that fills the entire world?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This darkness is sin, which issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of human society, the entire human race, is under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin is darkness, and sin results in death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Consider the situation in the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In every country, including remote backward countries, the people are living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not have any light, but instead live in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John chapter eight deals with fornication as the basic sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle, fornication is the base for all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first sin committed by Adam and Eve was, according to its spiritual significance, the sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means they committed fornication in turning to something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although they were made by God and for God, they left God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They turned their heart and their being to something in place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In principle, that was the committing of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the first sin committed by Adam, according to its spiritual significance, was the sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, we say that fornication is the basic sin, the base for all other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter eight John uses a case of fornication as an illustration of what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This case is a sign that, in principle, every sin we commit is a sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To commit spiritual fornication is to turn away from God to something apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the entire human race is turning away from God to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that, no matter what they are doing, in principle they are committing fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we enjoy other things, such as worldly entertainments and amusements, in place of God, in His sight that is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 8 deals with fornication as the basic sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that in this chapter the Lord Jesus declares that He is the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This light shines in the darkness, repels it, and even swallows it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only light can swallow darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When light comes, darkness vanishes immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only light can repel darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no way to get rid of darkness unless light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who is the light that repels the darkness of sin and death?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This light is Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we receive the Lord Jesus, He becomes the light of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that the light becomes life and brings in life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to Genesis 1, when there was light, it was possible for living things to come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Light issues in life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the Son of God, Christ is the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we receive the shining of this light, we receive life, for the light, as the light of life, issues in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This light is different from natural light or electrical light, which are not living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The light we have received from Christ is living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It lives in us, it grows, and it reproduces because it is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now we have seen three elements of the divine extract: the Son of the Father, light, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us now go on to consider the great I Am.</S>
