<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP OF GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE (CONTINUED)</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Wanting Man to Choose Freely&mdash;<br />
Giving Man a Free Will</h2>
<p>In order for man to receive His life, God put man in front of the tree of life, but He wanted man to choose freely. God put man in the garden of Eden in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:8-9). This indicates that God gave man a free will. A soda bottle cannot choose, because it does not have preferences, inclinations, or thoughts. However, the man that God created for Himself is living and has a will, preferences, inclinations, and thoughts. God wants to put His life into man, but He cannot disregard man&rsquo;s consent and force-feed man like a mother who forces a child to receive medicine. If God forced His life into man, man would consider God to be barbaric, uncivilized, and unpleasant. Instead, God is noble; He does not like to force man. He gave man the freedom to choose. If man has a regard for God, man can choose God. Otherwise, God will let man be.</p>
<p>The matter of free will is a great subject in Christian theology. God has a will, Satan has a will, and man has a will. Therefore, there are three wills in the universe, each of which is free. No one can force God, and no one can force Satan. In the same way, man has a free will. God does not force man; only the evil one, Satan, forces man to do things. Those who are upright do not force others; only evil men force others. Sometimes, evil men, such as bandits and robbers, will also tempt, deceive, seduce, and ensnare. In order to gain man, Satan either forces or ensnares man. However, our God is too great and too noble. He respects man and never forces or ensnares man. God presents man with what He wants to do so that man may choose; then He accepts man&rsquo;s choice. After God created man, He put man in front of the tree of life because He wanted man to be free to choose.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Tree of Life versus<br />
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>Given the freedom to choose, man was presented with two opportunities. One opportunity was the tree of life, which signifies God Himself. To choose the tree of life is to choose God, to contact the tree of life is to contact God, and to receive the tree of life is to receive God. Man also had an opportunity to choose the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God, because the Bible repeatedly says that God is life (John 1:4; 11:25; 1 John 5:20). But how can we say that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan? The tree of life involves only life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, however, is more complicated because it involves knowledge, good, and evil. Knowledge, good, and evil include everything that man contacts in the universe that is apart from God. Hence, in the universe man can contact either God or knowledge, good, and evil. Thus, knowledge, good, and evil refer to everything other than God, and Satan is the center and totality of these three items. If we are contacting something other than God Himself, it belongs to either knowledge, good, or evil. Everything that man contacts or encounters on the earth encompasses either God or knowledge, good, and evil. The things related to mankind are good if they are somewhat noble, evil if they are somewhat base, and knowledge if they involve wisdom. Man&rsquo;s life on earth involves worshipping, contacting, and gaining either God or knowledge, good, and evil.</p>
<p>To contact life is to contact God, because the ultimate destination of life is God. Similarly, to contact knowledge, good, or evil is to contact Satan, for Satan is the manipulator behind knowledge, good, and evil. The issue of contacting life is that man receives life, but the issue of contacting knowledge, good, and evil is that man receives death. The ultimate issue of everything outside of God, whether it is good or bad, is death. People think that good is different from evil. But the Bible reveals that both evil and good are not life and are outside of life. Furthermore, people, especially those in the twentieth century, regard knowledge as if it were indispensable. The twentieth century can be called the century of knowledge, the age of knowledge. However, we must remember that the issue of knowledge is death, the issue of good is death, and the issue of evil is death. These three items seem different in nature, but they lead to the same destination and result in death.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
