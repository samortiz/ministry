IN THE ONE WHO EMPOWERS US</h2>
<p>Another aspect of being full-time is shown in Philippians. In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; Probably we have never related this verse to being full-time. To be a job-dropping full-timer is not a small thing. In ourselves we cannot do it. Philippians 4:13 is related to Paul&rsquo;s being such a full-timer. No one can do it except those who do it in the One who empowers them. We all need such a Christ. If you are thinking to take the full-time way, you must realize that it is only possible for you to do it in Christ who empowers you. Do not think, &ldquo;Well, it might be all right because in my locality the church has over one hundred fifty people. Surely they can support me.&rdquo; To think this way is wrong. This is the same as being hired by your church. You should not consider in this way. When all those thousands of scattered saints from Jerusalem went to Samaria, how could the Samaritans support them? How could they get a job? Who supported them? They must have lived of the gospel. They did this in the One who empowered them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST EXAMPLE OF BEING FULL-TIME</h2>
<p>The highest example of being full-time was the Lord Jesus. Up to the age of thirty, He made a living by being a carpenter. In all those years He had a job, but then He came out at age thirty to serve God with His full time. Nobody paid Him or hired Him.</p>
<p>He was tempted in the wilderness by the Devil concerning His living (Matt. 4:1-4). The Spirit led Him into this temptation. He did not enter into temptation by doing something wrong, like we sometimes have done. Many times we have gotten into temptation because of our mistakes, but the Lord Jesus was brought into that temptation by the Spirit. This temptation was a test to prove that He was qualified to be the King for the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s fasting was also the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, and His fasting led Him into a position to be tested. For forty days He did not eat. Then He became hungry. At this point the Devil tempted Him to perform a miracle to make the stones become loaves of bread (Matt. 4:3) to prove that He was the Son of God, that God was really with Him. But the Lord Jesus would not do it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE LORD<br />
AND TRUSTING IN HIM FOR OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>When you go full-time, sometimes you also will be led by the Spirit into a hunger, with nothing to eat and nothing to live on. At that time you will be tempted by the Devil who would say to you, &ldquo;You are a servant of God. Surely you can pray that God would do something as a miracle for you.&rdquo; Eating is always a trap used by the Devil to snare man. The Lord Jesus, humanly speaking, was mainly supported by His followers who were the women. These women not only supported Him, but they also supported His other followers (Luke 8:2-3). Peter, James, and John all gave up their fishing occupations and became &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in following Jesus. They traveled around, going through the villages with no certain place to stay and no assurance of something to eat.</p>
<p>They just liked to be with this Person. The Lord was like a magnet who drew and attracted them to Himself. The Lord said that &ldquo;the foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head&rdquo; (Matt. 8:20). Even though He did not have a resting place, the disciples just wanted to be with Him where He was. Their fortune was just to be with Him without any concern for their living.</p>
<p>The job-dropping full-timers should be honest with their parents. Tell them you are not sure where your support will come from. Tell them you feel that the Lord wants you to go full-time, and that you will follow Jesus and serve Him. The husbands who are burdened to be full-time also have to fellowship with their wives honestly. They should not assure them with promises of security. You cannot assure your wife with any security. All you can do is ask her to go the full-time way with you.</p>
<p>Does this kind of talk disappoint you? If so, then you should go back to your job. Thousands of people got helped, healed, and saved by the Lord, but eventually only a hundred and twenty remained with Him. At that time the Jewish people were threatening all the followers of Jesus but these hundred and twenty were not afraid of this kind of threatening. For ten days they did nothing but pray. You may wonder how they lived, but they just lived. The Bible is a wonderful book. It does not tell us how these people were supported, how they survived. Yet they survived. Would you still take this way? There is no promise that anyone will support you. No one would beg you or put you on the payroll. Just do it in Him who empowers you.</p>
<p>When I became a full-timer no one hired me. The church was small and could not support me. Mainly it was only my brother and I who supported the church because only we made good salaries. That was over fifty years ago, when the world&rsquo;s financial situation was very poor. The living standard was very low, and it was hard to make money. A teacher in high school could only make about twelve to fifteen dollars a month, which was only good for two or three persons to live on. It was hard for every family to have any savings. I realized this and others reminded me that it was mainly only my brother and I who supported the church. I was also reminded by some that if I gave up my job, I would need somebody to support me. Some said, &ldquo;You are now supporting the church. When you become one who is supported, who will support you?&rdquo; I did not know, but I made a resolution to live in a very simple way. As long as I could live, I did not care. That was my intention. I was burdened to give up my job just to preach Jesus.</p>
<p>In case you still could not make a living, you can &ldquo;make tents&rdquo;; you have a good example in Paul. We may be strange and peculiar persons whom others cannot understand. They will say, &ldquo;Is this not your job?&rdquo; No, it is not. Paul made tents, and he even had co-workers, Priscilla and Aquila, working in the same trade. The church in Rome (Rom. 16:5) and in Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:19 cf. Acts 18:18-19, 26) met in their house. They were so much for the Lord&rsquo;s interest, yet they still made tents.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
