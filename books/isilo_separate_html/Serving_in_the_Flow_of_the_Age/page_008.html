<p>Almost eighty to ninety percent of our living and meetings involves human effort; it is the result of many years of teaching. Initially, this teaching was like a child-conductor to us, but it is also possible for these teachings to become doctrines to us. The law of the Old Testament was intended to be a child-conductor to conduct the children of Israel unto Christ (Gal. 3:24), yet after much conducting, the Israelites could not let go of the law and come to Christ. They even opposed Christ. It is the same with us. We have been taught many things, yet we remain in these teachings today. As a result, we oppose the spirit and cannot bring the brothers and sisters out of doctrines into the spirit.</p>
<p>We came to Taiwan in 1949 and began a training work in 1952. We could not continue the training after 1960 because there were problems. Ever since then we have been trying to save the saints from being merely doctrinal, but it has been difficult to turn them to the spirit. I absolutely believe that <em>teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</em> in Colossians 3:16 means that our words of teaching should not come from our mind but from our spirit. Although this verse speaks of teaching, this teaching is based on the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING AND PRACTICING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our understanding and practice must be based on the spirit. Because we lack experience in living according to our spirit, as soon as we endeavor to practice living according to our spirit, our mind takes over. This is because we are not filled in spirit. Whatever comes out of our mental considerations is never as spontaneous as that which is of the spirit. We do not exercise our spirit enough. We have talked about spirituality for over a decade, but the result has been only an artificial spirituality, that is, a spirituality that comes from human effort. Our spirituality is neither heavenly nor spontaneous, because our spirit has not been filled; instead, it is deflated and weak. What we regard as spirituality is largely a matter of our own efforts, conceived in our mind and executed by our will. This is the true nature of our so-called spirituality.</p>
<p>The Lord does not want an artificial spirituality based on our human effort. We must learn to live in the spirit every day in order to spontaneously live out a genuine spirituality rather than working out an artificial spirituality. As we develop a habit of living in our spirit, we will not need to rely on human efforts; instead, we will spontaneously live according to our spirit, speaking to one another and teaching one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. There will not even be a need for much explanation when we teach in this way because the words of the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs will convey the teaching of the Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>We must wake up and have an inward turn. I am not encouraging us to do something in an outward way, but only that we would wake up and turn. As Christians, we have too much of the element of human work in our living and meetings, because we have not been filled enough in spirit. Thus, our spirit has not been released enough, and we have been left with only teachings. Such teachings are religion. Religion teaches us how to worship God, please God, and serve God, but it has no element of the spirit. Even if we touch a little element of the spirit in our living and meetings, we mainly touch an element of human work. Therefore, we should have a great turn and ask the Lord to have mercy on us and save us from any desire for artificiality in our living, meetings, or service. We need to live the Christian life out from our spirit spontaneously and to function in our meetings spontaneously. This depends upon the continuous exercise of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Practicing according to Brother Nee&rsquo;s Vision</h2>
<p>It grieves me to say that our overall situation has been going down, even though we have been working for many years. We are not advancing, because we want to keep the old ways. Even our history in mainland China illustrates this point. Between 1932 and 1950 when I was with Brother Watchman Nee, he changed quite much. His changes were improvements based on seeing new things. When he saw something new, he moved forward according to the vision. However, there were only a few co-workers and brothers in the churches who actually kept up with him. Almost every time that Brother Nee saw something new, he would give new messages. When he gave these messages, those attending would nod their heads and take notes, but almost no one practiced what Brother Nee had seen.</p>
<p>For example, Brother Nee clearly saw some matters related to the practice of the church life in 1940 when he spoke concerning the service of the eldership, the coordination of the service, and the receiving of the believers. He also talked about setting up a church business office for the various services of the deacons, and he started practicing these matters in Shanghai. He made arrangements for the services of the elders and for the various services of the deacons. In 1948, however, only the church in Shanghai and the church in Chefoo were practicing these things. None of the other local churches were practicing these things.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War in 1940, people fled to regions that were not affected by the war. Many people heard the gospel and were saved, but they were not made aware of these new practices. Thus, even though the co-workers brought the gospel to those unaffected regions, the believers were short in matters related to the practice of the church life. Brother Nee had been practicing these things for several years, but the co-workers seemed to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to them. When the co-workers went out to work, they still spoke of things from the 1930s.</p>
<p>At the end of 1940, the practice of the church life started in Chefoo, and I made arrangements with two brothers for the services of the elders and the deacons. When I set up the church business office in Chefoo, for example, one of these brothers helped me to handle and arrange many matters. By 1948 there were only two churches&mdash;Shanghai and Chefoo&mdash;that practiced the church life according to Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading. These two churches practiced these matters very successfully, and there was a revival in both places.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
