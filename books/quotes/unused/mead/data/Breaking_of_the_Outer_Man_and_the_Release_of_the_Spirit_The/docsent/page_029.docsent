   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>During these years God has been taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God does not want to see a saved person wait for many years before he deals with his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He does not want to see him wait for many years before he consecrates himself to the Lord or answers the Lord's call to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord is taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel has to be recovered, and the fruit of the gospel has to be recovered as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as a man is saved, he should be delivered from sin and should consecrate himself absolutely to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As soon as he is saved, he should break the power of mammon in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should be like the ones who were saved by the Lord in the Gospels and in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the gospel is indeed to be recovered, the preachers of the gospel must allow the Lord to cut a free way through them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We believe that as the Lord takes the way of recovery, the gospel of grace will become one with the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Gospels we see no separation between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, it seems as though those who heard the gospel of grace did not have a chance to hear the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gospel of grace seems to have been separated from the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the time will come when the gospel of grace will become one with the gospel of the kingdom once again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who receive the Lord will also give up everything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who accept Him will also consecrate everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Men will no longer be saved in a poor way but in a strong and thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to humble ourselves before the Lord and say, "The gospel needs to be recovered, and the ones who preach the gospel also need to be recovered."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for the gospel to reach men, we have to allow God to work through us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A greater power is needed for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even so, a greater price needs to be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we expect both the gospel as well as the ones who preach the gospel to be recovered, we have to give everything to the Lord and say, "Lord, I give my all to You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I pray that You will find a way through me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I pray that the church will also find a way through me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not want to hinder You or the church."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus was never a limitation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He never limited God in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the past two thousand years God has been working in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The goal is for the church to eventually not be a limitation to Him either.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as Christ was God's manifestation rather than His limitation, the church should be His manifestation rather than His limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has been teaching, buffeting, stripping, and smiting His children continually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is how He deals with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will continue this work in the church until the church no longer is a limitation to Him but a manifestation of Him instead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we can only bow down our heads and say, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are ashamed that we have delayed Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have frustrated Your life, Your gospel, and Your power."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each one of us has to say to the Lord, "I give my all to You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I pray that You will have a way through me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we want to see an absolute recovery of the gospel, we have to have an absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is foolish to only lament the fact that our gospel is not as powerful as that of the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to acknowledge that our consecration is not as absolute as the consecration of the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to recover the gospel, we have to recover the consecration; both have to be absolute and thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord find a way through us.</S>
