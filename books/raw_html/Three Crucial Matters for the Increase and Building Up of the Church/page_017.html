	 <h2 class="head1">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING<br />
BY SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>We have been influenced by degraded Christianity to the extent that we are nearly beyond rescue. Starting from today, we must reverse our old habit of not speaking in the meetings by everyone speaking for the Lord in the meetings. The problem of not speaking in the meetings comes not only from the poison of Christianity but also from the traditional training in Chinese homes. Most Chinese parents charge their children to keep silent when they are not at home. According to a Chinese proverb&mdash;disease enters through the mouth, and misfortune issues from the mouth&mdash;we should speak as little as possible. There is a true story about a mother and her child who were invited out for dinner. The child was naturally talkative, and the mother was afraid he would say something inappropriate in the presence of others. Hence, she kept the child beside her and pinched him whenever he began to speak so that he would stop. It was an unpleasant situation with the mother pinching the child every time he spoke.</p>
<p>In the church, however, we want everyone to be like the child who wanted to speak. There is another teaching that is used in Chinese homes: &ldquo;Many words, many mistakes; few words, few mistakes; no words, no mistakes.&rdquo; We should not apply this teaching in the church; all the saints should speak in the meetings. The best situation is when all the saints speak.</p>
<p>Our God is not merely a speaking God (Heb. 1:1-2); He is the Word (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13). In the universe words are very important. Human culture comes out of words and is contained in human language. Culture cannot exist without language, and language advances with culture. First there was electricity, then electric lamps, telegraphs, and telephones were developed. Now we are more advanced, and we have televisions and other appliances. The development of names for these things proves that language advances with culture. If God did not speak in Genesis, creation would not exist. If the people God created were mute, society would not have developed. We should consider what human society would be like if people could not speak. God created us in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26-27); God can speak, and we can speak. If we could not speak or if we did not speak, we would not be like God.</p>
<p>If God did not speak, we would not have the books of Genesis through Malachi. We would be in darkness. If Matthew did not write his Gospel, Paul his Epistles, and John Revelation, there would not be a Bible, and we would be confused people. We should not rebuke the saints who have not been meeting for a long time, nor should we make demands on new believers. We must go to God&rsquo;s children and speak His word to them. We must use God&rsquo;s word to nourish and supply them. We were made according to God&rsquo;s image; we are like God. God speaks, and we also must speak His word.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God repeatedly exhorted and charged the Israelites to teach their children the words that He had commanded them. He said, &ldquo;These words, which I command you today, shall be upon your heart; and you shall repeat them to your children, and speak about them when you sit in your house and when you journey on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up; and you shall bind them on your hand as a sign, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes; and you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates&rdquo; (Deut. 6:6-9). When we compare our living to these words, we feel ashamed because this is not our practice. Some of us never speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in our homes; we do not speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to our children. We speak about many things, but we do not speak God&rsquo;s word. According to God&rsquo;s command, we should speak His word every day in our homes. Even though we need to read the newspaper in order to know the world situation, the reading material we set out in our homes should be the Recovery Version of the Bible, the Life-study messages, and spiritual books.</p>
<p>Some saints in Texas have the Life-study messages on their bookshelves and coffee tables, in the kitchen, and even in the bathroom. The Life-study messages can be found everywhere in their homes. This makes it convenient to read a message at any time. If we exercise to read God&rsquo;s word in this way, we will be able to speak God&rsquo;s word. We will speak to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates. We will speak God&rsquo;s word everywhere. If we speak for God and speak God&rsquo;s word, the church will bear fruit for God, the atmosphere in this country will change, and society will be turned upside down.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING<br />
BUT NO ONE TAKING THE LEAD</h2>
<p>We are changing the system in order to change the habit of not speaking in the meetings. Everyone must speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. If we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in the meetings and at home, the condition of the church will change for the better, and it will not be difficult for the church to spread and increase. Presently we rejoice when one person is saved and baptized, but when we all speak, we will not find it strange if one thousand people are baptized, because it will be a normal occurrence.</p>
<p>We are very happy when a few people are saved, because we do not speak, we do not have new ones for the increase of the church, and we are not spreading. If we all speak for the Lord and speak His word every day in our homes and in every place, people will be amazed at the kind of people we are, the number of new believers will increase, and we will spread. On the positive side, the change in the system is to cause everyone to function, and on the negative side, by changing the system, no particular person has to take the lead. Rather, everyone takes the lead.</p>
<p>We are not that bold when we preach the gospel. It seems as if we can only beg people to receive the Lord, and we are thankful when we are not opposed. When someone receives the gospel, we are in the third heaven. Not many among us can boldly preach the gospel to sinners and ask a new one to open his home immediately after he is saved in order to preach the gospel to others and to have home meetings.</p>
<p>We do not speak in this way, because we do not believe that a new one will open his home or that he can preach the gospel immediately after his salvation. We spend much energy to set up home meetings, but we do not have the faith to ask the new believers to open their homes. We also have the subconscious desire to be a leading one. We do not believe that others can take the lead, and we are not willing for them to take the lead. Instead, we want to take the lead. The ones who truly desire to take the lead among us are the co-workers. Wherever they go, they want to take the lead. The elders are the second group of people who like to take the lead. The leading ones in the service groups are a third group of people who like to take the lead. Whether they are leading ones in the cleaning service group or in teaching <em>Truth Lessons,</em> they like to be responsible to arrange things for others. This concept of taking the lead is a fallen concept that produced organized Christianity and gave rise to the clerical hierarchy of pastors, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</p>
<p>In changing the system, we want to overthrow the concept of taking the lead by allowing everyone to function. The elders and co-workers must be patterns. From now on we should not have leaders; we should only have patterns. The elders and co-workers must function as patterns to help the saints know how to advance.</p>
<p>For the past twenty or more years, the work in Taiwan has not spread very much. There has been no increase in the churches and the number of churches has not increased. There are only eighty localities in Taiwan. But in America more than eighty churches have been raised up over the past twenty years, and approximately twenty churches have been raised up in Canada. This means that more than one hundred churches have been raised up in North America. More than one hundred churches have been raised up in South America. There are also approximately one hundred churches in Europe, Africa, and Australia. Who took the lead to raise up these churches? Some people have written books to condemn me and say that I control people with an iron hand and that I am a dictator, a pope. They lift me up too high. I am more than eighty years old, and I have no way to even read all the letters I receive, much less use an iron fist to control people. I am not a pope, and I do not want to make myself a leader. I am simply a pattern to show people how they should function. I cannot control whether people do what I say. I teach the truth and write books. I only want people to be supplied in life and edified in the truth. Many of the letters I receive from around the world, especially those from America, say how much the writers have been helped by my books. This would not be the result if I was taking the lead as some people suggest.</p>
<p>My point is that we must all rise up, and everyone must speak. It does not matter if we say something wrong. The co-workers, elders, serving ones, and the teachers of <em>Truth Lessons</em> are not leaders. We do not have any leaders among us; at the most we have patterns, who direct the saints and help them take the proper path. For this reason, when an elder is serving, he should not serve by himself. Three to five people should serve with him, and he should teach them how to serve. After doing this a few times, the elder should take his hands off and let those who have learned by serving with him bear responsibility for the matter.</p>
<p>In 1946 the church in Nanking felt that the victory in the war created an opportunity for the work, and they invited me to visit them. In our first meeting I said that they should not expect me to work for them. I was there to discharge the burden within me. At the time I was caring for Nanking and serving in Shanghai. The church in Shanghai had not held meetings for several years because of the war. When the meetings in Shanghai were recovered, I spoke the same thing in Shanghai. I said that I had not come to work for them but to be a pattern by working with them and by teaching them how to serve. I also said that after I taught them, they would do everything by themselves.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the church in Taipei until today, nothing has been in my hands. The brothers can testify that I can leave Taipei at any time without the need to give anyone instructions because everything is in the brothers&rsquo; hands. The brothers from America can also testify that even though the meeting hall of the church in Anaheim is close to my home, the church in Anaheim is not in my pocket. I do not know how many meetings the church in Anaheim has every week or what they do in the meetings. All the service is under the care of the brothers. This is my testimony. I hope that all the co-workers and elders will have the concept that wherever they go, they are patterns, not leaders.</p>
<p>A few years ago I spoke with the co-workers and elders in the church in Taipei, and asked why they made the meeting hall look like a government building. This gives people the impression that they are in a government office when they go to see the elders. The brothers said that they did not intend to make the meeting hall look like a government office. However, this was the real situation. Some saints are afraid to knock on the door of the elders&rsquo; room because they feel as if they are visiting the president. This is intolerable. Once, a spiritual brother who loved the Lord visited a city in Europe. He was very famous, and everyone in the city wanted to see him. However, he avoided everyone and went to play with the children. When the people eventually found him, they were disappointed and thought that he was not spiritual. Actually, this brother was truly spiritual. If he had behaved as if he was the most spiritual man in Europe, he would not have been spiritual.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to take care of the meeting, the elders sit in the front row for the convenience of communicating with one another, but sitting in the front row should not become a rule. The saints should not think that the seats in the front are only for the responsible brothers. We must change this practice. The responsible brothers do not necessarily need to sit in the front. They can sit there for the convenience of making announcements, but to make this a special situation is the way of the Pharisees, who loved the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues (Matt. 23:6). The Lord Jesus said that whoever wants to be great among us shall be our servant (v. 11; 20:26). Those who preach the word and administrate the churches should not act as the head. Whenever they act as the head, they annul the function of the other believers. Changing the system is to eliminate the habit of some being the head so that every brother and sister can rise up to speak for the Lord.</p>
