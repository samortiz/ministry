Disciplining Simeon</H2><P>Joseph was also wise in his discipline of Simeon. In 42:19 and 20 Joseph said to his brothers, "If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses: but bring your youngest brother unto me." At first Joseph thought that one brother should be sent to bring the youngest brother and that all the rest should remain in prison. But after three days Joseph changed his mind and decided that only one should stay in prison and that the others should go to bring the youngest brother to him. Therefore, he "took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes" (42:24). I believe that it was Simeon who took the lead in plotting to murder Joseph. I also believe that Simeon took the lead to bind Joseph and to cast him into the pit. As 49:5-7 reveals, Simeon was a person given to anger. Thus, Joseph had him bound and put into prison. What do you suppose Simeon thought about there in prison? I believe that he repented to the uttermost and regretted what he had done. Perhaps he said, "Why did this man choose me? Why did he set his eyes upon me? Maybe it was because I took the lead in the plot against Joseph." Simeon was in prison for at least half a year, having been accused of being a spy. This was a serious crime and it could have cost him his life.</P><P>Do not think that Joseph was cruel and merciless for treating Simeon in this way. On the contrary, he was full of mercy. The ten brothers deserved their three days in prison, and Simeon deserved a longer period of imprisonment. Joseph was wise in doing this. He was controlled by a life that gave him a sober discernment. Whatever Joseph did to his brothers was right. He did neither too little to them nor did he do too much. We in the church life need to have such a life of discernment. If we have this discernment, we shall know what to do with the brothers and the sisters. We shall know how far we can go with them and where we need to restrain ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Testing Them<br>with Respect to Benjamin</H2><P>Furthermore, Joseph displayed his wisdom in testing his brothers with respect to Benjamin (42:15, 20, 36-37). In 42:15 Joseph commanded that the youngest brother, Benjamin, be brought to him. By singling out Benjamin in this way, Joseph helped his brothers to think about Joseph himself. If I had been Joseph, I would have said, "Don't forget what you did to Joseph." Joseph, however, wisely referred to Benjamin. As soon as he referred to Benjamin, his brothers were reminded of Joseph. This must have touched their consciences. In 42:13 they said to him, "Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not." If I had been Joseph I would have asked, "Where is that one whom you say is not? What happened to him?" In his wisdom, Joseph touched his brothers' consciences.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_657.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_659.html">Next</a> </body></html>
