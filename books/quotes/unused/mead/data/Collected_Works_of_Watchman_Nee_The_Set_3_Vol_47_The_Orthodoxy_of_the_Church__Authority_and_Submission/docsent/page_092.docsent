   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE NEED OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SANCTIFY HIMSELF Scripture Reading: John 17:19</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that spiritual authority depends on spiritual attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No authority is appointed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not even appointed by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please remember that authority is based on attainment on the one hand and on humility and obedience before God on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we will say something more about the need for a deputy authority to set himself apart from others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although our Lord was sent from God and had uninterrupted fellowship with God, He said, "For their sake I sanctify Myself" John 17:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A deputy authority must therefore sanctify himself for others' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LORD'S SANCTIFICATION OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean that the Lord sanctified Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It means that the Lord refrained from doing many things, which were legitimate for Him to do, for the sake of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He could have done and said many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He could have adopted many attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could have worn many different kinds of clothing and eaten many different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the sake of the disciples, however, He refrained from them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God; He does not know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While He was on the earth, He had much more liberty than we have, and He could have done many more things than we.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many things which we cannot do because we are the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many words we cannot speak because we are unclean persons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But such a problem did not exist with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are impatient; therefore, we need to learn to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Lord was never impatient; therefore, He did not need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many restrictions which did not have to apply to Him, because He had no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the unclean ones being around Him, the Lord Jesus as a man could have had so much more liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even when He was angry, His anger was holy and without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet He said that He sanctified Himself for the disciples' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was willing to take many restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord was not only holy before God; He was holy in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as His own character is concerned, He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But while He moved among His disciples, He needed to sanctify Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For us to become holy we need to refrain from many things, but the Lord is holy in His very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why He can do so many more things than we can.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It would be very wrong for anyone to say that he is good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it is perfectly all right for the Lord to say that He is good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He can say many things that we cannot say, because there is no taint of sin in Him whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has more freedom than we have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet He willingly subjected Himself to restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord is not only holy in Himself, He condescended to our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our holiness necessitates our setting ourselves apart from others and refraining from doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition to His own holiness, the Lord took our holiness upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why He sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord willingly accepted restriction for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man speaks and judges by his own sinful standard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord had acted and spoken according to His own standard of holiness, man would have criticized Him according to his own sinful thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why He willingly placed Himself under restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We refrain from doing many things because of our sins, but the Lord refrained from doing many things and placed Himself under restrictions because of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not do things because we should not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord could have done them, yet He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He refrained from many things which He otherwise could have done for the sake of maintaining God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wanted to set Himself apart from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what it meant for the Lord to sanctify Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE LONELINESS OF AN AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order for us to learn to be an authority, we must also learn to set ourselves apart from the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to refrain from many things which we otherwise could do or say.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should be separated in our speech and in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may hold a certain attitude when we are by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when we are with others, we have to set ourselves apart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can only fellowship with the brothers and sisters to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot be flippant or frivolous.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to give up our freedom and suffer loneliness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Loneliness is a mark of being an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All those who are frivolous among the brothers and sisters cannot be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not pride.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It merely means that for the sake of representing God's authority, we have to have certain limitations in our fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot be too loose or easy-going.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sparrows fly in company, but the eagles fly alone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we can only fly low and not suffer the loneliness of flying high, we are not qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In order to be an authority, we have to be restricted and must separate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot do what others can freely do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We cannot say what others can hastily say.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to submit to the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Holy Spirit within us will teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This will make us lonely; it will strip us of excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We will no longer dare to joke around the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the price that an authority has to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must sanctify ourselves as the Lord Jesus did before we can be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As far as being a member in the Body is concerned, an authority has to be absolutely inconspicuous, being the same as the other brothers and sisters, in order to maintain the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, in representing God, an authority has to be restricted by God and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He should be a pattern to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But in acting as a member, he should coordinate and serve together with others, not setting himself apart as a special class.</S>
