My heart often thinks about you. May the Lord bless your share of the labor in the work. I received your letter yesterday and read it. I am well; please do not worry about me. We stayed in Ch'ang-sha for more than ten days. We met the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall, fellowshipping, breaking bread, praying, and testifying together. I stayed in Brother Liu's place in the orphanage. We took the southwest bus and train route at the beginning of our journey. The mountain roads were steep, and the bus was on steep slopes. The higher we climbed, the more dangerous it became. We were racing into the fog, and we felt as if we had left the earth far behind and were closer to the Lord. We feel that Kweichow province is still very barren. It does not seem to have much vegetation. Apart from Zhu-cheng, we did not see any fertile soil. The Han people and the Miao natives live together, and development is slow. There is a great need for the gospel. Please pray for them. K'un-ming is at a higher elevation, but it is flatter and more fertile. It has bountiful produce and a good climate. It does not rain often. Winter is leaving, and the cauliflower is turning yellow. The peas are already full in the pods. Visitors coming for the first time often feel that it is very dry here. We have already acclimated and are doing well. We did not know anyone when we came, but we were thankful to have Brother Chung Huang's gracious hospitality. We stayed in his home for nearly ten days. Now the Lord has prepared a house for us to rent, and we are living in it. Prices are cheaper, so it is easier to make a living. We can live on what I brought for a while longer if we are thrifty. Thank the Lord for His grace, and thank the brothers and sisters for your prayers. All the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming are well. Peace in the Lord! Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong for me. Please greet Brother Stephen Kaung for me.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 26</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>To Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I left Hankow on December 29 and arrived in Ch'ang-sha on the thirty-first. Thank and praise the Lord! On the afternoon of January 4, I was able to get my bus tickets without any problem. The buses to Kuei-yang were booked up to April 17. However, one person had made a reservation and did not come to buy his ticket on the fourth, so the ticket office sold me that ticket. My fare was sixty-one dollars and twenty-five cents to travel by bus to K'un-ming. If anyone wants to go to K'un-ming, they should definitely not buy their tickets in Kuei-yang. Some people do not know that they can buy combination bus and train tickets; therefore, when they get to Kuei-yang, they wait for two or three months and still cannot get bus tickets. On the morning of the fifth, I went to the West Station in Ch'ang-sha to wait for the bus. It was 11:30 a.m. before all the people crowded in. The bus did not go for very long before there was a problem with the tire. We waited several hours for help. I was secretly praying. The rescue bus arrived at 6:15 p.m. If it had not come, we would have had to spend the night in a small town nearby, which was certainly dangerous because bandits might have attacked us. We crossed the river into Yi-Yang around 7:50 p.m. and headed for Ch'ang-Teh. By the time we reached Ch'ang-Teh, it was already midnight. I went to the station the next morning to ask whether the bus to Yuan-Ling had come. I waited for one day. The bus to Yuan-Ling did not come until the seventh. We left at 9:00 a.m. and arrived at 5:30 p.m. I boarded the bus at 9:00 a.m. on the eighth and arrived in Zhi-Jiang at 3:00 p.m. We were in Huang-Shian by 5:00 p.m. I spent the ninth through the eleventh in Huang-Shian waiting for the bus to Kuei-yang. I left Huang-Shian at 10:00 a.m. on the twelfth and passed through Yu-Ping Station and Jen-Yuan Station, arriving at Huang-Ping Station at 6:00 p.m. Then I left Huang-Ping at 11:00 a.m. on the thirteenth and passed through Zhung-An, Lu-Shan, Ma-Chang-Ping, Sha-Ping, Kwei-Ding, and Lung-Li. I arrived at the Kuei-yang station at 8:30 p.m. From Hunan to Kweichow, the bus spent one whole day going through the mountains. I heard that the bus which left Ch'ang-sha on the sixth had an accident. Twenty of the twenty-five passengers were injured. But thank the Lord for bringing me through. I also heard the other passengers say that in those five or six days there were no attacks by bandits. The buses are usually attacked and robbed by bandits, who are usually natives of the Miao tribe. They particularly love to rob armed passengers of their weapons. I also thank the Lord that it did not rain between Ch'ang-sha and Kuei-yang because it is difficult for the buses to run when it is raining. I passed out gospel tracts on the fourteenth, and I did not want to leave. I also wanted to rest. I could not have left in any case, because there were only one hundred seventy-five seats on the bus that left for K'un-ming on the fifteenth, and my number was one hundred seventy-seven. It rained on the fifteenth. There were no buses on the sixteenth. There were no passenger buses on the seventeenth either, but I worked out a deal with the station master and was able to take a Corps of Engineers' bus to continue my journey. When we got to An-Shun area, the bus had a flat tire, so we had to wait for several hours. The rescue bus arrived at 4:30 p.m., and we continued on for about twenty minutes to the An-Shun Station. We left An-Shun at 1:30 p.m. on the eighteenth. It was already 5:00 p.m. when we arrived in Kwan-Ling-Chang. The driver said the bus could not continue. It was 7:00 p.m. before help arrived. We drove for several minutes up a deserted mountain and then had to stop at the top because the bus did not have water. All the travelers who had wash basins had to get out to fetch water. After we found water, we continued on our way. We arrived in Yung-Ning Station at 8:30 p.m. We started out again at 9:00 a.m. on the nineteenth and arrived at the Pu-An Station at 4:00 p.m. The driver did not want to continue, so we had to spend the night there. We left Pu-An on the twentieth at 9:00 a.m. and arrived at the Pan-Shian Station at 11:35 a.m. This was the last stop in Kweichow; the bus did not continue on. Pan-Shian has two bus stations, one for Kweichow and one for Yunnan. I had to register at the Yunnan Station to find out about buses. When I boarded the bus on the twenty-first, there were not any seats, so I had to sit on a suitcase. We left Pan-Shian at 9:47 a.m. and arrived in Ping-Yi at 11:50 a.m. The inspection was very rigorous. The bus did not leave until 1:30 p.m. We arrived in Chu-Jing at 3:25 p.m. I left Chu-Jing on the morning of the twenty-second and arrived in K'un-ming at 3:00 p.m. I went first to Deng-Shi Street to see Brother Huang. Then I heard that he had moved to Wen-Miao-Dong Lane, but I did not know the number. I could not find his house, so I had to stay in a hotel for one night. I looked for him again on the morning of the Lord's Day, the twenty-third. I found the place because I heard the sound of the brothers and sisters singing hymns to remember the Lord. The brothers and sisters were very surprised. Thank the Lord, the weather was good from Kuei-yang to K'un-ming (with the exception of Chu-Jing where it snowed for a few minutes). I also thank Him that I was not carsick except for one day, nor did I feel tired. I saw the Lord's grace in all things.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen<br />January 24</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
