Although this book is a book of prophecy, it is not prophecy merely in words, but in visions revealed to the seer
In the eyes of God all the things prophesied in this book have already transpired and all have been shown to the seer in vision after vision
Strictly speaking, Revelation is not merely a prophecy; it is a revelation of things which have already taken place
Most Christians consider Revelation to be a book of predictions and they are curious to understand these predictions
The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God's work through the centuries, has been completely built up, and we are in it!
In the book of Genesis, the serpent was not so old, but in the book of Revelation, he has become old, at least six thousand years old
At the time of the book of Revelation, however, Satan is not only 'the old serpent'; he has also become a dragon
Shortly afterward, according to 20:10, the Devil will be cast into the lake of fire, which is his destiny and destination
We all must see this to the uttermost, forgetting ourselves, our weaknesses, our besetting sins, and even the fact that we are on earth
If the book of Revelation were deleted from the Bible, there would be a great shortage, for there would be a beginning but no ending
Although there is the beginning in the book of Genesis, without the book of Revelation there is no conclusion or consummation
After having a good start and after passing through so many works, there is the need for God to have a consummation
We would even find it difficult to realize what God's economy is, because we would not see the result, the issue of His economy
John, the writer of this book, was in this kingdom , and all the redeemed and reborn believers are a part of this kingdom
One of the main aspects of this book is that God is recovering His right over the earth to make the whole earth His kingdom
The kingdom is for God's dominion, while the priests, being those who express God's image, are for God's expression
It will be intensely practiced in the millennial kingdom , and it will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem
Without Revelation, we could read the Epistles again and again without realizing that the church is Christ's testimony
Along with God's economy, Christ's redemption, and the church's testimony, Revelation also discloses the enemy's destination
In Revelation we have the conclusion of four major things-God's economy, Christ's redemption, the church's testimony, and Satan's destiny
Revelation is also the conclusion of the New Testament, which is composed of the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation
As the last book of the Bible, Revelation is the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the entire divine revelation, the whole Bible
Most of the things covered in this book are not absolutely new, but refer back to the foregoing books of the Bible
As the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the Bible, the book of Revelation especially is 'the revelation of Jesus Christ'
In the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles we do not see that Christ has seven eyes, but this is revealed in the book of Revelation
In his Gospel, John says, 'Behold, the Lamb of God' , but in Revelation one of the elders says, 'Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah'
Christ is the Witness , the testimony, the expression of God, and the church is the testimony, the expression of Christ
In the book of Revelation we see God's universal and eternal administration which is for the carrying out of His economy
If you know the history of the world, you will realize that this has exactly been the situation during the past twenty centuries
The sixth seal, taking place very near to the time of the great tribulation, covers the shaking of earth and heaven
At the opening of the sixth seal, there will be a great earthquake which will be a warning to earth's dwellers
Although they may say that they are God, when the real God comes to shake their dwelling place, then they will know who God is
Before the great tribulation begins, God will send forth a warning to all the earth's dwellers reminding them that there is a God
When you seal something, you make it secret and private, but when you sound a trumpet, you make something public
As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live in
The seven bowls like the seven seals and the seven trumpets are composed of a group of the first four and then the fifth sixth and seventh
The book of Revelation has five sections: the introduction , the things seen , the things present , the things to come , and the conclusion
Following this introduction, we have the things seen-the seven lampstands and the Son of Man with the seven stars
In Genesis 1 we have a general record of God's creation; in Genesis 2 we have the details of God's creation of man
In their reading of the book of Revelation not many Christians have paid their full attention to the revelation of Christ contained in it
If we read the whole book of Revelation, we shall see that this term indicates that Revelation is the unveiling of Christ Himself
If we would see this picture, we must come to the book of Revelation where we have a portrait of Christ in the heavens after His ascension
The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome and is worthy to open the seals of God's economy
Now sin is over, Satan has been terminated, and we have been redeemed and rescued from the usurping hand of the enemy
Whenever we Christians have said that Christ was worthy, our thought was that He was worthy of our praises and thanks and worship
When we said, 'Lord Jesus, You are worthy,' not many of us realized that He was worthy to open the seals of the secret of God's economy
We only had the concept that Christ was worthy to receive worship, praise, and thanks from us, His little creatures
We must realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ's worthiness is a matter of His being worthy to open the secret of God's economy
Because Christ is so worthy, here in this heavenly scene He is worshipped by the angels and all the other creatures
The angels are represented by the twenty-four elders, and all the other creatures are represented by the four living creatures
No matter how much this earth is judged by Christ in God's administration, He will take care of the chosen Israel and of the redeemed church
It does not matter what the other nations say or do, for the nation of Israel is under the care of Christ's universal administration
The other countries may try certain things, but all will be in vain because of the watchful concern of the universal Administrator
We all must worship Christ as the Administrator, as the One in the heavens administering all things for the fulfillment of God's economy
According to one concept Christ will come before the tribulation and according to the other concept His coming will be after the tribulation
We must be clear that Christ's coming back will firstly be concealed and eventually it will be manifested openly and publicly
During the more than nineteen centuries since Christ's ascension, the world has been punished by natural calamities
The sun becoming black as sackcloth, the moon becoming as blood, and the stars falling to the earth are supernatural calamities
The first four trumpets will bring forth judgment on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars
Besides His judgment upon the whole world, the Lord will execute a special judgment upon Christendom, Babylon the Great
The Antichrist is the man of sin and the little horn , and the false prophet is the one who works with the Antichrist
If you are not willing for Him to enliven you today for salvation, at the end of the old creation He will resurrect you for judgment
John 5:28 and 29 say, 'An hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth
In the Old Testament, Christ was called the Angel of the Lord who was sent by God to carry out God's commission
He will be the centrality and universality in the New Jerusalem as the tree of life growing in the river of water of life
In the last message we pointed out that many aspects of Christ which are not found in other books in the Bible are unveiled in Revelation
To say this is absolutely scriptural, for the book of Revelation says that the local churches are golden lampstands
Although the church is composed of humanity with divinity, humanity should not be the basic nature of the local churches
Ephesus lost her first love-negative; Pergamos is worldly-negative; Thyatira is demonic-negative; and Laodicea became lukewarm-negative
On the positive side, however, all the local churches are identical, because they all are seven golden lampstands
If you could place all the seven lampstands on a table before you unless you numbered or labeled them you would be unable to tell them apart
Since 1962, some voices in this country have declared loudly that they will never be like the church in Los Angeles
The church is not only the lampstand and the great redeemed multitude; it is also the greater part of the woman with the man-child
During the three and a half years of the great tribulation she will be protected by God from the attack of the serpent
The man-child will fight through and up, fighting up to the throne to cast Satan down from the heavens to the earth
Although Jesus has defeated Satan on the cross, there is still the need for the church to execute His victory over the enemy
We must realize that God has a need for us to be raptured-we must be raptured to heaven that we might fight against the enemy
If you do not go to heaven to meet Satan and cast him down, then he will come down to the earth to meet you and overcome you
The church is not only the lampstand shining and the man-child fighting, but also a field growing a crop which must ripen and become mature
According to the type in the Old Testament, the firstfruits of the ripened harvest were not taken to the barn but into the temple of God
We must not only be todays lampstands but also todays manchild to fight against Gods enemy and todays firstfruits to satisfy Gods desire
In a sense, the great tribulation will be the strong sunshine which will ripen all the saints who will not be ready before the tribulation
Even during the time of the great tribulation, there will be some overcomers, those whom we may call the late overcomers
We expect to see the rebuilding of the temple in Israel, for this will be a sign that the Lord's coming back is very near
The Bible prophesies that Antichrist will erect his image in the temple of God and will force people to worship it
Those on the glassy sea are those who have the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name
Ephesians 5 reveals that the church is the Bride of Christ, but it does not reveal the Bride in such an intimate way
To God's enemy, we must be the man-child; for God's satisfaction, we must be the firstfruits; and for Christ, we must be the Bride
The false Christ will be so bold as to fight against the real Christ, but the real Christ will war against the false one
In 17:14 we see that Christ's heavenly army will be composed of all the overcomers, those who have been called and chosen
When we come to chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, we shall see a clear picture of this ultimate consummation
Throughout the centuries, however, most Christians have not fully realized the meaning of the term the Triune God
Governmentally, He continues His universal operation which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion
It is impossible for us to understand the Triune God thoroughly, for the divine Trinity far surpasses our mentality
At the opening of the Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned, from whom grace and peace are given to the receivers
The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in verses 4 and 5
Is the number of completion in God's dispensational move, while twelve is the number of completion in God's eternal administration
In the book of Revelation the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are all for God's dispensational move
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits are for God's move on the earth
In substance and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
We all are familiar with three-way bulbs, light bulbs that can be switched to three successive degrees of illumination
In the four Gospels, the Spirit of God was onefold because at that time there was not the need for so much light
In existence, the Holy Spirit, like the lampstand in Zechariah, is one, but in function the Holy Spirit is seven
Many Christians argue that the Holy Spirit of God is separate from Christ, but the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ
To say that the Holy Spirit is separate from Christ does not correspond with the pure revelation of the Holy Word
To say that the Spirit is separate from Christ is to pluck out the eyes of Christ and to separate them from Him
Some of us have gone places where we should not have gone, and when we arrived there, we were greeted by the Spirit, who said, 'Go back
After we have the words, we have sentences, paragraphs, and chapters, and once we have the chapters, we have the whole Bible
Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and in Revelation 1:5 we are told that He is the Firstborn of the dead
In God's first creation there was a beginning, and in God's second creation in resurrection there was another beginning
The first and the last simply indicate the first and the last without indicating either the beginning or the ending
He is the first and the last, the beginning and the ending of God's operation, and the content and continuation of whatever God is doing
As the root, He is the first, the beginning, and the Alpha, and as the branch, He is the last, the end, and the Omega
His being the Sun is mainly related to the people on earth, but His being the morning star is related to His watchful, waiting believers
Without the Son's being so many items, the Father could not be adequately expressed and the Spirit would not have so much to express
The revelation regarding Christ's second coming is not simple; rather, it is quite complicated and has several aspects
During the past century and a half, many books have been written, especially by the Brethren, about the second coming of Christ
They certainly had a strong ground for saying that the second coming of Christ would be after the great tribulation
If we would understand the second coming of Christ, we must study the Bible and also read the books written by these great teachers
If we do this, we shall be fully convinced that Christ's coming has two aspects: the secret, private aspect and the open, public aspect
As we pointed out in a previous message, when the Lord comes as a thief, He will come to steal the precious things
In Matthew 24:40 and 41, the Lord spoke of His secret coming, saying, 'Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left
The Lord Jesus was very wise, using two brothers in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill as illustrations
After giving this illustration, the Lord said, 'Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes
Revelation 101 reveals that the Lord will come down out of heaven clothed with a cloud indicating that He will be wrapped up with the cloud
As we shall see in later messages, before He leaves the throne in the heavens, some overcomers will have been raptured to the throne
After these early overcomers have been raptured, Christ will descend from the throne to the air in the cloud secretly
In the first step, Christ will leave the throne in the heavens, come down to the air wrapped in the cloud, and remain there for a time
Revelation 2:28 says that Christ will appear as the morning star, and Malachi 4:2 reveals that He will appear as the sun
The Lord promised us that if we are watchful and wait for His coming, He will appear to us as the morning star
Do not think that Christ's coming back is a simple matter of His leaving the throne and coming immediately and directly to earth
According to the context of Zechariah 12, the tribes are not all the nations of the earth but the twelve tribes in the Holy Land
While the day and hour of Christ's coming in its secret aspect are unknown , the time of His coming in the second aspect is clearly revealed
Matthew 24:15 says, 'When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place'
The great tribulation will begin at the time the Antichrist erects his image in the temple and forces people to worship it
According to the New Testament, the Lord Jesus will leave His throne in the heavens and descend to the air before the great tribulation
At that juncture, when escape is impossible, the Lord will appear as a flash of lightning and set His feet upon the Mount of Olives
If we put all the verses together, we can see that the Lord's open coming will probably be near the end of the great tribulation
As long as the temple in Jerusalem has not been rebuilt, it is impossible for the Lord Jesus to come back openly
When the Lord Jesus comes openly, He will come with the overcoming saints to fight against the Antichrist and his army at Armageddon
Eventually, the riches of the world will be concentrated in the Middle East, and all the nations will be greedy to seize them
While the armies of the earth will be gathering at Armageddon, the Lord will be sitting in the air observing them, saying, 'Are you ready'?
When we come to chapter fourteen, we shall see that the gathering of the armies will be the gathering of the grapes into the great winepress
As the kings, generals, and leaders gather all the armies at Armageddon, they will be like grapes gathered into the great winepress
We are studying the heart's desire of the Lord, which is to gain a group of overcomers who are watching and waiting for His coming back
The phrase in Jesus governs the words tribulation, kingdom, and endurance, and we must pay close attention to it
When we say that we are in Christ, this means that we are saved, are enjoying God's grace, have peace with God, and are under God's blessing
In Ephesians, on the contrary, the term in Christ or in Him is used repeatedly, being found in every chapter of that epistle
In the eyes of God, we are the followers of Christ, but in the eyes of people, especially religion, we are the followers of Jesus
He was not persecuted by a heathen, pagan religion, but by the typical religion formed according to God's oracles
The Jewish religion was established on three pillars, one of which was the Sabbath; the other two are circumcision and dietary regulations
Eventually, religion succeeded and actually killed the Lord Jesus, sentencing Him to death according to their Scriptures
As Foxe points out in his history of martyrs, the Roman Catholic Church killed more saints than the Roman Empire did
The rumors, opposition, and condemnation came, not from the Gentiles, but from Christianity, even from some missionaries
If you read the book of Galatians, you will see how intensely Paul persecuted the church when he was in the Jewish religion
When the religious people persecute us, they are actually persecuting Jesus because Jesus is in us and is one with us
If our honesty and faithfulness bring us suffering and persecution, that is the persecution in Jesus, and that is Jesus' suffering with us
Those who hold this concept say that the kingdom came, that it was rejected and suspended, and that it will come down in the future
The Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, 'The kingdom of God does not come with observation; Nor will they say, Look, here!
In this life there is the divine nature, and with this divine nature there is a ruling, a reigning, a governing
If you remain in the kingdom and live in it, you will never fight with your husband, your wife, or anyone else
Paul seemed to be saying, 'You Christians, the believers of Jesus, must suffer persecution from the Jewish religion'
As we have already pointed out, most of the troubles, persecutions, rumors, and oppositions can be traced to one source-religion
Some have suffered persecution from their relatives, friends, and neighbors, but eventually they exhausted their supply of endurance
While they were able to withstand the persecution for a certain time, they lacked the endurance to bear it for a longer time
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He endured persecution , and He is still enduring men's opposition and reproach today
On the one hand, He is sitting in the heavens; on the other hand, He is still being mocked, opposed, and persecuted
We have heard of the power of Jesus, the love of Jesus, the holiness of Jesus, the righteousness of Jesus, but not of the endurance of Jesus
If we approach them from the viewpoint of our experience, we shall see that they follow one another in a very good sequence
The coming again of the Lord Jesus requires that some partake of the tribulation, the kingdom, and the endurance in Jesus
We shall approach the local churches by the way of considering the progress of the divine revelation in the Scripture
Following the four Gospels, we have the Acts and the Epistles, which mainly are a revelation of Christ as the Spirit
Although they have the whole Bible, in practicality they have little more than the Old Testament and the Gospels
Although these Christians may know a little concerning the church, they only see the universal church, not the local churches
The first three chapters of Revelation are not concerned with the universal church; they are emphatically concerned with the local churches
Today, we in the Lord's recovery have the whole Bible: the Old Testament, the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the Revelation
Concerning His creation, God is revealed as Elohim; concerning His relationship with man, He is revealed as Jehovah
In other words, in the Old Testament Jesus was called Jehovah, and in the New Testament Jehovah is called Jesus
The entire Old Testament, which comprises thirty-nine books, is mainly a revelation of the two divine titles, Elohim and Jehovah
Few Christians have ever fought for the revelation of God, and not many have fought for the revelation of Christ
When we come to the matter of the Spirit, there is much argument because the revelation of the Spirit is a mystery
It is difficult to know the church because Satan, the subtle enemy, is not willing for Christians to see what the real church is
If we talk about the church without having the expression of the church, our talk is entirely theoretical; it is not practical
If we are asked where the church is, we can point to the churches in Anaheim, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and many other places
Some Christian friends have argued with me, saying, 'Why do you say that you are the church and that we are not the church'?
Before the Lord's recovery came to the United States, no Christians said that they were the church in Los Angeles
They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil , shining in the darkness respectively and collectively
They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally
They are not only shining locally, but also bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe
They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness
The differences of the local churches recorded in chapters two and three are all of a negative nature, not of a positive nature
The churches with Christ as their center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
Whenever we try to be wise and not arouse opposition against us by avoiding discussion of the church, we are immediately deadened within
Our burden today is to bring God's people to His goal, and our purpose is to help the saints to reach God's destination
When we first came into the local church life, something deep within said, 'This is the place,' and we knew that we were home
Now the Body of Christ is expressed in all the local churches, for the local churches are the expressions of the universal church
God's revelation began with God Himself and continued with Christ and the Spirit until it reached its goal in the local churches
God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit who imparts life to us, and the Spirit issues in the churches
He is not only our Savior, our Redeemer, our Lord, our holiness, and our righteousness; He is the very life-giving Spirit
Most Christians have missed this very crucial point, for the subtle enemy has done his best to hide this matter
In knowing Christ as the life-giving Spirit we must not rely upon our mentality, for it is too limited to comprehend this
Not only is Christ Himself wonderful mysterious unlimited and unsearchable but even the food we enjoy each day is beyond our understanding
After coming into the church, we realized that our experience of Christ had created a hunger and thirst for the church life
Today we are here for the testimony of Jesus which issues from the genuine experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit
The universal church is the Body, the fullness, of Christ, and the local churches are the expressions of this universal church
He was also brought to the open door of heaven and to a great and high mountain and thus saw Gods revelation and realized Gods manifestation
Today, many Christians who are talking about the church do not see the local churches, mainly because they are not separated unto God
To see these four visions, John was in his spirit , as mentioned in Ephesians 3:5 for the revelation of the mystery of Christ
The apostle John firstly heard the voice , and when he 'turned to see' the voice, he saw the golden lampstands
He was rightly positioned, but he still needed the right angle to see the vision concerning the churches; thus, he turned
Since nearly everything in the book of Revelation is based upon the Old Testament, most of the items mentioned in this book are not new
Although we have seen that the local churches are the testimony of Jesus, it may be somewhat difficult for many to grasp the meaning of this
Biblical symbols are difficult to comprehend, for we cannot understand a symbol like the lampstand according to our natural concept
Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made the stand is the embodiment of the gold and the lamps are the expression of the stand
Although the Jews have used this symbol for centuries, they do not know its real significance-the significance of the Triune God
Substantially, the lampstand is one, but expressively, it is seven because it is one lampstand with seven lamps
If we only had the record in Exodus, however, it would be difficult to realize that these seven lamps are the Spirit
As we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ and the seven eyes of God
As we continue on to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God
We have a strong basis for saying that the seven lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ
We have seen that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God; it symbolizes the Triune God embodied and expressed
God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit
God, the divine Being, is firstly embodied in Christ and then expressed through the sevenfold intensified Spirit
Now we not only have the Triune God; in the lampstand we have the Triune God substantially and solidly embodied and expressed
As we have seen, this stand, which is a type of Christ, is expressed through the seven lamps signifying the seven Spirits of God
The seven Spirits of God are not separate from God; they are the seven eyes of God and of the Lamb, the Redeemer
In both Exodus and Zechariah, the lampstand is one, but in Revelation it has been reproduced and has become seven
Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and the lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the churches
In Exodus and Zechariah there are just seven lamps, but here in Revelation there are forty-nine lamps, for every lampstand has seven lamps
When Christ is realized, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is realized, we have the churches as the reproduction
We have seen that the lampstand is the divine gold embodied into a substantial form to fulfill God's purpose in His move
The lampstand not only signifies the Triune God, but also the move of the Triune God in His embodiment and expression
We also have seen that the local churches are the reproduction of the embodiment and expression of the Triune God
In Exodus 25 the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as the seven lamps with the Spirit
While Christians talk a great deal about the Trinity, very few have seen that the Triune God is for God's building
The lampstand in Exodus 25 typifies Christ as the expression of God shining with the seven lamps, the seven Spirits of God
Today, there is a greater need for the lampstand because we are not only in God's building, but also in the recovery of His building
For the recovery of His temple, God gave a vision to Zechariah that by it he might be able to strengthen Zerubbabel
Revelation 56 also speaks of the seven eyes of Christ the Lamb saying that they are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth
In Zechariah 3 and 4 Christ is the stone for God's building, and in Revelation 5 He is the Lamb for our redemption
We may pay our attention only to the lampstands and neglect the lamps, but the lampstands are not for the lampstands; they are for the lamps
Revelation does not say that Christ is the seven lamps today; rather, it says that the seven Spirits of God are the seven lamps
While the stand is the embodiment of the substance, without the seven lamps, this embodiment cannot have its expression
The substance is the Father, the embodiment is the Son, and the expression is the Spirit expressing God the Father in the Son
The churches are the lampstands, and the lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the expression of Christ
In today's dark age, the church really needs the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God to shine forth the testimony of Jesus
Once Brother Nee said that probably these foolish virgins would go to the two olive trees to gain the extra portion of the Spirit at a cost
Having covered the first seven points, we come in this message to the eighth-the Son of Man in the midst of the churches
Whenever He is related to the church, He is revealed in His human nature because the church is composed of human beings
Christ is not only depicted here as the High Priest, as shown by His garments, but also unveiled 'like the Son of Man'
We believe and accept the fact that our Christ is both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity
Concerning the Person of Christ there have been differing opinions, and Christians have fought with one another about them
When Christ comes to deal with us in the churches, He does so not only in His divinity but also in His humanity
As the Son of God, the Lord is quite capable, but you, as a mere son of man, are pitiful, and the Lord should not condemn you so much
Today the Lord is both in the heavens and on the earth walking, in His humanity, in the midst of the local churches
Although the word priest is not mentioned here, we know by His garment that Christ is depicted here as the High Priest
Among the three offices of priest, prophet, and king, the most dear, intimate, precious, and lovely office is that of the priest
To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for work, whereas to be 'girded about at the breasts' signifies care in love
Christ is now exercising a divine care over the churches, moving among them in His humanity and caring for them with His divine strength
These seven eyes of His are the 'seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God'
His throne is like the fiery flame and its wheels as burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him
When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire
As we have already pointed out, when He comes to possess the earth by judging it, His feet will be like pillars of fire
Once, as they were meeting together, they were discussing and debating with one another; eventually the debate turned into a fight
However, 'His face' is 'as the sun shines in its power,' as in Daniel 10:6, for the judging enlightenment to bring in the kingdom
In verse 18 we see that the Lord is 'the living One,' the One who 'became dead' and who is 'living for ever and ever'
These seven churches are excellent illustrations, revealing the local churches, not in doctrine, but in actual practice
Although we have loved Him in the past and may love Him now, there is the danger that our love for the Lord Jesus might fade
As we shall see, love gives us the position, the ground, the right, and the privilege to eat of the tree of life
If we have love, then we shall have the life symbolized by the tree of life and the light signified by the lampstand
Anyone among them who would repent and return to his first love would be considered by the Lord to be an overcomer
The Lord also said, 'You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false'
If you want to understand what the works of the Nicolaitans are, read Brother Nee's book, The Orthodoxy of the Church
The works of the Nicolaitans refer to a hierarchy among the saints in which some set themselves to rule over others
There were the works and activities of the Nicolaitans, that is, there was some type of hierarchy of clergy and laity
The word Nicolaitans is an equivalent of the Greek word Nikolaitai the root of which is Nikolaos composed of two Greek words niko and laos
In the New Testament God has returned to His original intention according to His economy in that He has made all believers in Christ priests
At the end of the initial church, even in the first century, the Nicolaitans intervened as the mediatorial class to spoil God's economy
According to church history, this became a system adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and was also retained by the Protestant churches
In the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity; all believers should be the priests of God
Now the second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord
We may work and labor for the Lord and we may be pure doctrinally and correct scripturally, yet not have the first love for the Lord
We may remain the same in everything else-in work, labor, and in other things-but we are degraded because we have left our first love
Do not think that because we are the local churches as the lampstands and are the testimony of Jesus that we cannot lose our testimony
It is foolish to say that Christ today is not the speaking Spirit, and it is ridiculous to separate the speaking Spirit from Christ
Every church should not only give heed to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches
Since the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we must be in the churches to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit's speaking
When we are in the church and among the churches, we have the right position and the right angle to hear the Spirit's speaking
Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered as merely doctrines to teach our mind, but as food to nourish our spirit
The degradation of the church distracts God's people from the eating of Christ as their food to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge
In the Bible, 'the tree of life' always refers to Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God for our food
Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again
In the church's degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life
The Lord promises to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the paradise of God as a reward
Due to the church's degradation, the Lord comes to call the overcomers to replace the church in the accomplishment of God's economy
The eating of the tree of life not only was God's original intention concerning man, but will also be the eternal issue of God's redemption
All His redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as their portion for eternity
If we know the Bible, we shall realize that the paradise of God in 2:7 is not the garden of Eden but the coming New Jerusalem
We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church
If we overcome all distractions in the churchs degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today we shall be thus rewarded
Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life
If we would be brought back to the beginning, we should forget everything and simply enjoy Christ as the life supply
As we have pointed out, Ephesus means desirable, indicating that the church in Ephesus was precious to the Lord and desirable in His eyes
Although no one can continue Christ's redemption, His sufferings must be completed by all His followers both individually and collectively
No matter how great were the sufferings through which He passed, those sufferings could not terminate or damage Him
When the Lord told the church in Smyrna that He was the First and the Last, He was indicating that the church had to be victorious
She must pass through all the sufferings and come to the end because the Lord who is the life and Head of the church is the First and Last
Severe the persecution may be, the church will still be alive, for the resurrection life of Christ within her can endure death
You must welcome death and be happy, for once you have passed into death you also will be on the threshold of resurrection
The extent to which the church experiences and enjoys the resurrection life of Christ can only be tested by tribulation
In verse 9 the Lord also said that He knew 'the slander of those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan'
According to this epistle, the persecution came from religion, from the unbelieving Jews of the synagogue of Satan
Since the Church under the new covenant in God's economy had no part in their religious practice, the Judaizers slanderously criticized her
The synagogue was under the manipulating, maneuvering hand of Satan, for he was the power at the back of the synagogues at that time
Even when He was on earth, He considered the synagogues to be of Satan, as implied in Matthew 12:25-29 and John 8:44
They persecuted and killed God's true worshippers, yet they considered themselves to be offering service to God
In the same principle, the Jewish synagogues stirred up the Roman government to persecute the suffering church
Religion has no power to cause physical damage to the Lord's lovers, but it does use politics and the government to damage the church
The persecution suffered by the church began from the religious synagogue of the Jews instigated by Satan, the adversary
Even the Lord's word in this epistle to the suffering church is the speaking of the Spirit to all the churches
As a result of this judgment, they will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement
Do not hold to the traditional theology which teaches that after you have been resurrected everything will be all right
At the other extreme is the teaching which says that after you have been saved you can have no problems with the Lord
If we overcome in this way, we shall have nothing remaining that will require the Lord's further dealing in the future
When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy
He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine's welcoming her as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century
Since the church is a spouse to Christ as a chaste bride, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God
In the epistle to the first church, the Lord advised the church in Ephesus to repent and to recover her first love
In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion
By being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world
The church must be a golden lampstand, the pure expression of the Triune God, and must have no connections with the world
After the Roman Empire had made the church a worldly religion, she became altogether impure, worldly, and idolatrous
Since the church has entered into union with the world and has become worldly herself, she now dwells where Satan dwells-in the world
If we are snared by it, we shall eventually become worldly and not only be in union with Satan, but also one with him
The church must have nothing to do with the world and must not yield an inch to Satan's evil and subtle saturation
In the first three epistles we see three churches-the desirable church, the persecuted church, and the worldly church
The epistle to the church in Pergamos teaches us that we should not be in union with the world in any way, sense, or aspect
We have never received a good name, because Satan will not allow you to have a good name unless you enter into union with him
As an anti-witness, Antipas bore an anti-testimony, a testimony against anything that deviated from the testimony of Jesus
Antipas took the lead to fight against the worldly church, pioneering the way for us to fight against the worldly church today
In the Lords recovery we must fight against this that the church may hold fast the Lords name the reality of the Lords Person for eternity
Because the church entered into union with the world, she began to disregard the Lord's name and to deny the proper Christian faith
Although many Christians opposed the recovery they nevertheless were positively influenced by it and as a result they changed in many ways
They would not take the way of the Lord's recovery, but they did feel its influence and they took from us many of our teachings
When he was asked about our work on that island, he said that, except for a dead fly in the ointment, it was a good work
He said that one preacher had told him that they cannot understand why there is always so much new light in the churches
He had gone to another place, had delivered the messages, and then had them published as a book, under his name
When the worldly church disregarded the name, the Person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication
Rather, they subtly teach people to eat idol sacrifices, that is, to take in evil, devilish, and demonic things
So many teachings in today's Christianity cause people to take in the demonic things and to be related to things other than Christ
On a particular Sunday morning, one of these Balaams delivered a lecture on sanitary education, talking specifically on how to kill flies
Later, someone proposed that a particular object be set up in the church building and that everyone in the congregation bow down to it
The modernists do not believe that Jesus is God, that He was born of a virgin, or that He died on the cross for our redemption
They merely believe that He was crucified as a martyr, and they do not believe that Jesus Christ was resurrected
The worldly and degraded church holds not only the teaching of Balaam, but also the teaching of the Nicolaitans
Today, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, this Nicolaitan hierarchy prevails in both practice and teaching
The Lord says that He will come quickly and war with the sword of His mouth against some in this worldly church
The worldlier the church becomes, the greater is the need for some to stand up and testify and to maintain intimate fellowship with the Lord
If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we shall surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom
They come into the very intimacy of God's presence and here in this divine intimacy they enjoy the hidden manna in God's divine nature
It is so inward that those who eat of the hidden manna are actually in the divine nature enjoying the hidden Christ
The more the church becomes worldly, the more we need to enter into the Holy of Holies to eat the hidden manna
We must be in His divine nature where there is nothing worldly or distracting and where there is the intimate fellowship between us and God
When we say this to the Lord, we are immediately in the golden pot, in the intimacy of the divine nature, partaking of the hidden Christ
When the Lord first met Simon Peter, He immediately changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means 'a stone'
When he awoke from that dream, he took the stone which he had used for a pillow and called it the house of God
As this brother eats the Lord Jesus as the hidden manna, he will have certain experiences and the Lord will write a new name upon him
Since this new name is based upon what this brother is according to his experiences, others cannot know what it is
Verse 18 says, 'These things says the Son of God, who has eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like shining brass'
In dealing with the worldly church, the church in Pergamos, the Lord referred to Himself as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword
The Lord's eyes search the inward parts and the heart, and His feet judge and give to everyone according to his works
As we shall see, the woman here is the very woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, who added leaven into the fine flour
The church in Pergamos had the teachings of Balaam and of the Nicolaitans, and these are continued in this apostate church
The sound teachers of the Bible agree that the Jezebel in Revelation 2 is undoubtedly the woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33
The woman in Matthew 13 is the Jezebel in Revelation 2 and Jezebel becomes the great harlot who is called the great Babylon in Revelation 17
The principle of the deeds of the apostate church is to mix the heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people
She helps God's people to worship Him, but she does not do so in God's way; she does it in her own pagan, heathen way
The book, The Two Babylons, exposes the origin of the evil, demonic, pagan things that were brought into the apostate church
The New Testament confirms that all these are types of Christ, not only as our Redeemer but also as our life supply
In verse 21 the Lord Jesus said, 'I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication'
The Lord indicates here that the apostate church is incurably sick and will remain so until her final judgment
It is not a small thing for us to have our eyes opened to see the devilish and demonic things in the Catholic Church
The great tribulation in 7:14 is the tribulation which the church suffers throughout the centuries of persecution
If we read Revelation carefully, we shall see that at the end of this age the Antichrist will damage the Catholic Church
One of their philosophies is that if you do not add things to the truths of the Bible, it will be difficult for people to accept them
While the New Jerusalem is solidly built with these three precious materials, this evil woman is merely gilded with them
To be gilded means to wear a facade, to be superficially attractive, to have a pleasing or showy appearance that conceals something evil
Apparently, this woman is very attractive, being gilded with gold, pearls, and precious stones and holding a golden cup
The Lord calls her, 'The Mother of the Prostitutes,' meaning that she is the source of all spiritual fornication
Some who, through the Lord's sovereign grace, were saved when they were in the apostate church spontaneously loved that evil thing
Although many former Catholics have come into the church life, deep within, some of them may still sympathize with this evil woman
The Lord has no sympathy with Jezebel because that evil woman has been thoroughly saturated with Satan, the evil one
We are in the Body of Christ, the church of God, and we have nothing to do with Jezebel, the evil woman, the harlot, the great Babylon
In 17:16 we are told that during the great tribulation the Lord will allow the Antichrist to kill and to damage this apostate church
My works' in verse 26 refers to the things the Lord has accomplished and is doing, such as His crucifixion, resurrection, intercession, etc
All those in the apostate church, which demands that people listen to her rather than to God, need more of the speaking of the Spirit
At the end of each of the first three epistles, the ear for hearing is mentioned first, and then the call for overcoming
Since the creation is represented before God by four living creatures , the number four signifies creatures, especially man
The number seven denotes the completion in God's move, firstly in the old creation, and then in the new creation, the church
As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant Church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ
The Reformation was God's reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, signified by the degraded church in Thyatira
The seven Spirits of God are for the church to be living intensely, and the seven stars are for her to be shining intensely
To the church in Ephesus, Christ is the One who holds the seven stars and walks in the midst of the seven lampstands
To the messenger of the church in Sardis the Lord says, 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead
The things which remain' are the things lost and restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith and the open Bible
After getting into a denominational church, we were put into the refrigerator and, after a few months, we cooled down and died
Since the reformed Protestant churches are dead, they will be unaware of the Lord's coming as a thief in His secret appearing to His seekers
The revelation in the New Testament regarding the Lord's second coming is not according to our natural understanding
In understanding anything found in the Bible, we should have no trust in our thoughts, and we should never apply our natural concepts
His coming back will begin from the throne and will pass through a process until He descends to fight the battle at Armageddon
No one knows the time of the beginning of the process of the Lord's coming back and of the rapture of the early overcomers
Speaking of these who have not defiled their garments, the Lord says that 'they shall walk with Me in white for they are worthy'
White garments here signify the walk and living which are unspotted by death and which will be approved by the Lord
In verse 4 the Lord promises that the living ones, those who have not defiled their garments, will walk with Him in white
To overcome here means to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism
According to typology, the queen in Psalm 45 has two garments, one for salvation and the other for her to be with the king in His reign
Christ as our objective righteousness has been put upon us, whereas Christ as our subjective righteousness comes out of us
The name being 'erased out of the book of life' indicates that that name was already written in the book of life
The book of life' is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them
The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book
All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life
In 17:14, we can see that, at His coming back, after all the saints have been raptured, the Lord will make a selection
If we have lived in a victorious way, we shall be selected, and our names will be there during the thousand years
Although all the names of the students may be on the class list, only a few names will be on the list to receive a reward
Only those who cooperate with God's original intention will be in the kingdom enjoying Christ as their special portion
Because many will not cooperate with God, in His wisdom He has decided to make the enjoyment of Christ in the coming kingdom age a reward
It is good to see that God's blessing in His salvation is of three ages: the church age, the kingdom age, and the age of eternity
To the recovered church, the Lord is also the One who has 'the key of David' , the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut
We do not see this power until God's chosen people, the children of Israel, entered into the good land and built the temple
Apparently, the temple was built by Solomon; actually, it was built by David, for he was behind the building of the temple
The image and dominion revealed in Genesis 1 are, to some extent at least, fulfilled in the temple and the city
He is the One who expresses and represents God, the One who holds the key to open everything in God's dominion
In Isaiah 22 it was prophesied that Christ would not only be the One holding the key of David, but that He would also be a nail or peg
The overcomers in Philadelphia will be pillars in the temple of God and the temple of God will ultimately be enlarged into the New Jerusalem
Christ holds the key of David and He opens and shuts, not that we might be holy or spiritual, but that we might be built up
The so-called spirituality that cannot be tested, adjusted, or balanced and that cannot fit into the building of the church is a cancer
If we remain in our mentality, we shall not have the realization or the sense of being held by Christ in this way
After we have been released and have entered into the house of God, He becomes the nail holding us off the ground
As we shall see, Christ's writing the name of the New Jerusalem upon us means that we have been transformed into a part of the New Jerusalem
In the past, you might have pursued holiness or spirituality, but you sought holiness and spirituality in an aimless way
Many times we estimate the church in Philadelphia too highly, thinking that this church was strong and prevailing
Some may think that when the Lord raised up the brothers in England one hundred fifty years ago, every one of them must have been like David
According to history, no other Christians have kept the Lord's word as strictly as these in the church in Philadelphia
Although many condemn us, saying that we are heretical, among today's Christians no one regards the Lord's word more than we do
To deviate from the Lord's Word is apostasy, and to denominate the church with any name other than the Lord's is spiritual fornication
George Whitefield, a contemporary of John Wesley, once declared that besides the name of Jesus Christ he would have no other name
Although Whitefield was an Englishman, he renounced the name of the Church of England, not belonging to that name anymore
We replied, 'Yes, you have never denied His name, but you have taken another name in addition to and even above His name
As revealed in Deuteronomy chapters twelve, fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, God's economy is to have one unique temple on earth
The Lord charged His people in Deuteronomy not to have any place as their worshipping center other than that place which He would choose
Just as the temple was unique, but the synagogues were many, so the church is unique and the denominations and free groups are many
In typology, this is a sign of the real church in Philadelphia that the Lord raised up about one hundred fifty years ago
At that time, they were surrounded, not by Jewish synagogues, but by the synagogues of the denominations which criticized and slandered them
It is undeniable that the Lord loves the recovery, and eventually all the slanderers will acknowledge this fact
If she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord's recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone
The Lord promises the recovered church that He will keep her 'out of the hour of trial' because she has kept the word of His endurance
In this epistle the Lord brings the church in His recovery into the sensation of His coming because she loves Him
In 217 the overcomer becomes a transformed stone for Gods building but here the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God
When the Lord writes the names of God and the New Jerusalem upon us, it reveals that we are one with God and are a part of the New Jerusalem
The Lord will rightly designate us, writing upon us the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and His new name
The name of God means God Himself, the name of the New Jerusalem means the city itself, and the name of the Lord means the Lord Himself
The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom
The more we love the Lord and the more we are in His recovery, the more we need the rich speaking of the intensified Spirit
According to the context and according to history, the church in Laodicea must be a sign of the degraded recovered church
In 3:14 the Lord says, 'These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God'
To each of the seven churches the Lord refers to what He is and what He does respectively according to their situation and condition
In the eyes of the Lord, the church in Laodicea is not only poor in the riches of Christ, but also blind in genuine spiritual things
Due to the lack of the subjective experience of Christ, the degraded recovered church is naked in the eyes of the Lord
The vain knowledge of doctrines vanishes under the flaming eyes of the Lord, leaving those who hold them nakedly exposed
The degraded recovered church needs to pay a price for the gold, white garments, and eyesalve, which she desperately needs
In the Bible, our working faith is likened to gold , and the divine nature of God, which is the divinity of Christ, is also typified by gold
If you speak to the Lord in this way, He will immediately say, 'All right, if you would gain Me, you must pay the price
Although this is difficult to explain doctrinally, we know experientially that when we have the living faith, we enjoy the divine nature
The church in Laodicea needs this gold-the divine nature applied, appropriated, by the living faith which is Christ Himself
We pointed out in message fourteen that these white garments are not Christ as our objective righteousness for justification
When we have living faith and participate in the divine nature, this divine nature will eventually come out of us to be our living
We all have been justified and have been covered by the first garment, the best robe put on the prodigal son in Luke 15
Undoubtedly, as a child of God, you have been justified, redeemed, saved, and regenerated, and you are a member of Christ
On the other hand, you sense that you are naked, not having Christ lived out of you to be your beautiful covering
We all must pay the price, saying to the Lord, 'Lord, whatever the cost, I'll pay the price to have You live out of my being
If you pray this way to the Lord, He will become your outward covering, the second garment for you to be approved and chosen by Him
The 'eyesalve' needed to 'anoint' their eyes must refer to the anointing Spirit , who is also the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit
If this item is a valuable diamond worth five thousand dollars, you would not think that the price is too high
She needs to depreciate all her knowledge and repent of being satisfied with the vanity of knowledge and not with the reality of Christ
If we hear the Lord's voice to the church and personally open the door, the Lord will come in to us, and His presence will be our portion
In verse 20 the Lord also said that, after He comes in to him who opens the door, He will dine with him and he with Him
If you are an overcomer, when the Lord comes in the kingdom, you will have the special privilege of eating with Him
They tell the sinners that Christ is knocking at the door of their heart and that if they open the door, He will come in
Have you ever heard a message telling you that, if you open the door, Christ will come in to you and dine with you?
Recall that the promise of the hidden manna is given to the overcomers in the worldly church, indicating that Pergamos had returned to Egypt
Manna was not available in Egypt; it was only in the wilderness, and the hidden manna was only found within the Holy of Holies
Whenever the Israelites had a feast, they ate with God, offering what they were eating to God and letting God eat with them
We are not for teachings-we are for the full enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life, as the manna, and as the rich produce of the good land
If she forgets all her dead knowledge and listens to the speaking of the living Spirit, she will be delivered from her degraded condition
The first four churches eventually issued in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church
As a reaction to the apostate church, the reformed church came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered
Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God's eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after
And in 19:11, it is opened to John, the writer of this book, and it will be opened to all believers in the Lord in eternity
Today, man may do anything he likes, but the throne of God in heaven is still the authority over all men and all things
Apparently, this throne is invisible and is not realized by man, but actually it is behind the scene ruling over everyone and everything
The rainbow is a sign of God's covenant with man and living creatures that He will not destroy them again with the flood
Here, out of the throne of judgment come forth lightnings, voices, and thunders as warnings to the sinful world
Verse 5 also tells us that 'seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God'
The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2
The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God
The seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue also in God's building-the building of the New Jerusalem
While jasper indicates God as the God of glory in His rich life, sardius signifies God as the God of redemption
David divided both the priests and the Levites into twenty-four groups to carry out God's administrative service
Twelve times two signifies strengthening by doubling, indicating that the divine administration carried out by the angelic elders is strong
In the Bible, the number of the living creatures, four, always stands for the four ends that cover the whole universe or the whole earth
In Jeremiah 49:36 are the four quarters of heaven, and in Isaiah 11:12; Revelation 7:1; and 20:8 are the four corners of the earth
Verse 6 says that 'in the midst of the throne and around the throne' there were 'four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind'
As the seraphim they are for Gods holiness referring to Gods nature and as the cherubim they are for Gods glory referring to Gods expression
In verse 8 the living creatures say, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming'
People can easily realize the creation of God, but they scarcely know the will, the purpose, of God's creation
The book of Revelation is a record of God's thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe
Now, after Christ's ascension, there should no longer be a secret, for it has been unsealed by Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension
Now, as we are reading the book of Revelation, we are reading the contents of the scroll that has been unsealed by the ascended Christ
In 5:2-4 we see that no one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it
If we had been there, we, like John, certainly would have been desirous to see what was contained in that scroll
We have pointed out that nearly everything in Revelation is a fulfillment of what is mentioned in the Old Testament
Although the angels do not need redemption, they need someone to defeat the enemy of God, for one among them became God's enemy
To the angels, Christ was the Lion who defeated the rebel, but to us, including the apostle John, Christ is the Lamb, the redeeming One
As the root of David, Christ is more powerful and more victorious than David and has more of God's divine authority
As the Lion, Christ has defeated the rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away the sin of fallen man
Verse 6 also says that the Lamb has 'seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth'
These seven eyes are 'the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth,' running 'to and fro through the whole earth'
The seven lamps mentioned there are for the building up of the tabernacle, God's dwelling place among men on earth
As we have already pointed out, a person's eyes cannot be separated from him, for a person's eyes are his expression
The seven eyes of Christ, the seven Spirits of God, are Christ's expression in a judging way in God's move for God's building
Because He loves the church, He comes to search, enlighten, judge, refine, and purify us in order to transform us into precious stones
Today, the life-giving Spirit must be the flaming Spirit, and the transforming Spirit must be the searching and judging Spirit
We are not here for doctrine and teaching; we are here under the enlightening of the pure Word and under the searching of the seven Spirits
Because in Revelation the seven eyes are on the Lamb and in Zechariah they are on the stone, we may say that the Lamb is the Lamb-stone
That Christ, the Lamb of God, is the building stone with the seven eyes proves that the seven eyes of Christ are for God's building
Although He is the life-giving and transforming Spirit, to the degraded church He is the seven burning Spirits
In verses 8 through 10 we see the worship and praise of the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders to the Lamb
The bowls are 'the prayers of the saints' brought to God by the angelic elders , whereas the incense is Christ added to the saints' prayers
That these worshippers are holding the bowls means that they, as priests, are ministering to God by bringing the saints' prayers to Him
When the redeemed saints have been perfected and glorified to be the proper priestkings the temporary priests the elderly angels will resign
At the time of the millennium, the overcoming saints will be the perfected, completed, and proper priests and kings to God
As we have seen in the whole universe no one is worthy to open the mystery of Gods economy but Christ the overcoming Lion and redeeming Lamb
Kingdom is for kingship to exercise God's authority, and priests are for the priesthood to accomplish the divine ministry
According to historical facts the rider of the first horse the white horse must be the gospel not as some interpret Christ or Antichrist
The white horse is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel, which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both to men and to God
Some have said that the rider on the white horse is Christ, and others have claimed that the rider is the Antichrist
To take peace from the earth,' 'they should slay one another,' and 'a great sword was given to him' all clearly indicate war
The word translated pale may also be rendered pale green, signifying the color of the appearance of those stricken with the plague
In the history of the past two thousand years, there has been nothing except gospel preaching, war, famine, and death
If, as some say, the rider on the white horse is either Christ or Antichrist, then all the four seals would refer to the future
Based upon this principle, these four seals must be a history of the world from Christ's ascension to the end of this age
In order to understand the prophecy of the Bible, we must take care of history because the prophecies are predictions of things to come
After His incarnation, Christ accomplished redemption through crucifixion, entered into resurrection, and then ascended into the heavens
The door was opened, not only by civil war but also by the international war initiated by the Japanese invasion of China
Through the civil war in the 1940's, many Chinese went to Taiwan from mainland China, and thousands of them were saved
Having been forced to migrate to the island of Taiwan, thousands of people flooded into the church for salvation in the years 1949 and 1950
Many were saved, and some of them eventually became elders and deacons in the churches in Taiwan and co-workers in the Lord's work
God's wisdom is to make this age, the age from the ascension of Christ to His coming back, an age of gospel preaching
Factories, printing, airplanes, radio, television, and even nuclear weapons are for the preaching of the gospel
The rider on the first horse is neither Christ nor Antichrist; it is the preaching of the gospel of the glory of Christ
We have a bow without an arrow, for we are preaching the gospel of peace, a gospel in which the victory has been won, in a peaceful way
In the church age, the new testament age, God is doing one thing: He is producing the churches through the preaching of the full gospel
There will be eternity with the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem composed of all the redeemed saints
When we have this overall view, we can look into the book of Revelation and understand it adequately and properly
Both four plus three and six plus one indicate that the seven seals through Gods judgment bring Gods creation with all the creatures to God
While the gospel is being preached, as indicated by the first seal, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints
During the age of gospel preaching, many saints have been martyred because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus
Nearly all my older co-workers suffered martyrdom during the past twenty-six years by being kept in prison until they died
The martyrdom of the saints is not because of their opposition to any human rules, but because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus
Human society with human culture is wholly under the evil influence of Satan as it says in 1 John 519 the whole world lies in the evil one
Both the preaching of the word of God and the life of the testimony of Jesus are against the satanic trend in the world
The time will come when God will avenge the saints by exercising His righteous judgment over the earth which is under Satan's evil influence
In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth
On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Lord's resurrection, Peter said, 'David did not ascend into the heavens'
Matthew 12:40 indicates that Hades is in 'the heart of the earth' where the Lord Jesus went for three days and nights after His death
Using 2 Corinthians 12:2-4, some have argued that when Paul was 'caught away into paradise' he was 'caught away to the third heaven'
On the one hand, Paul was living on earth, but on the other hand, he was 'caught away' to the heavens and into 'the paradise'
As far as mankind is concerned, the universe is of three sections: the heavens, the earth, and under the earth
They say that when Christ comes back He will bring the dead believers with Him and that this proves that they must be with Him now in heaven
The sixth seal , which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God's answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal
According to Joel 2:30-31, there will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets
Following the sixth seal, at the opening of the seventh seal, are the first four trumpets as indicators that the great tribulation is coming
The opening of the seventh seal will bring in the seven trumpets, the last three of which constitute the great tribulation
After that, throughout the centuries, natural calamities have been and will be used by God to punish the earth until the sixth seal
Shortly after the opening of the seventh seal, the first trumpet will be sounded, and 'the third part of the earth' will be burnt up
Because the dwellers on earth have been so insolent toward Him for centuries, the time will come when God will no longer endure it
In His prophecy the Lord seemed to be saying, 'Don't live on this earth so complacently, not caring for God's purpose
You must realize that God has a purpose on this earth and that you must turn to Him for the fulfillment of His purpose'
If you read New Testament prophecy along with the Old Testament prophecies, you will see that there is a time called the day of the Lord
Several prophets of the Old Testament mention the day of the Lord, and they all indicate that it will be a dreadful day
Like an automobile which is warming up but has not yet moved, the four trumpets are the preparation for the great tribulation
The damage to the earth, waters, and the heavenly hosts will be greater than that caused by the earthquake of the sixth seal
When the Lord Jesus came, God changed the dispensation from that of keeping the law to that of believing in the Lord Jesus
The Jews would not accept this change and they refused to turn from keeping the law to believing in the Lord Jesus
God, however, is sovereign and He will always take care of the nation of Israel, not for their sake but for His economy
Reuben was the firstborn of Israel, but due to his sinfulness he lost his birthright and Judah prevailed above his brothers
In the account here, as in 1 Chronicles chapters two through nine, the tribe of Dan is omitted because of their idolatry
In this insertion we see a vision revealing how God preserves His redeemed saints throughout all the tribulations
The heavenly people, the Christians, are the stars, and the earthly people, the Israelites, are the sand of the seashore
God's way of preserving His redeemed saints is not to keep them on earth but to take them away by means of rapture
The insertion in this vision concerning the church gives us an overall view from the time of rapture until eternity
God's rapture of His redeemed saints will begin with the first overcomers, comprising the man-child in 12:5 and the firstfruits in 14:1-6
All of God's redeemed people have passed through certain tribulations, sufferings, persecutions, and afflictions
One day we shall come triumphantly out of the great tribulation and stand before the throne and before the Lamb
Palm branches were used for the feast of tabernacles, in which the people of God rejoiced for the satisfaction of their enjoyment
Standing before the throne' indicates that the great multitude of the redeemed ones must have been raptured to the presence of God
The record in verses 9 through 17 composes in a general way a scene from the rapture of the believers to their enjoyment in eternity
Verse 10 says, 'And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb'
Because the Lamb will supply them with waters of life for their satisfaction, they will have no tears of dissatisfaction
While the chosen remnant of Israel is sealed, the believers are regenerated, for God has put Himself into us as life
We shall be in that eternal state enjoying God's divine and eternal care and also enjoying the Lamb's eternal shepherding
While all the church people will be taken away, there is nonetheless a condition, the condition of maturity and of ripeness
We all can testify that since coming into the church life, we have been in the green pasture with the tender grass
Another major point in Revelation 5 is that Christ as the Lion-Lamb has 'seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God'
According to our human understanding, we would simply say that the seven lamps are for the intensification of the light
In Zechariah we see something further regarding the seven lamps, for in Zechariah 3 and 4 we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes
Although Zechariah 4:10 speaks of the seven eyes of the Lord, the connection between the eyes, the lamps, and the Spirit is not made clear
We need to proceed further to the book of Revelation, where we see the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits
In Exodus we have the seven lamps, in Zechariah we have the seven eyes, and in Revelation we have the seven Spirits
Whenever we are searched, purged, purified, refined, and judged by the flaming eyes of Christ, we gain something of Him
By infusing us with His essence He makes us the same as He is and by so doing He transforms us from being natural into being the same as He
We all must see that the seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God and of the Lamb, are absolutely for God's building
According to doctrine, the Spirit and Christ are two separate individuals, but according to experience, They are one
If they put all their doctrines into experience, they will find that it is wrong to separate Christ from the Spirit
The whole Bible is related to God's building, and God's building is accomplished by the Triune God being dispensed into us
If we do, we shall be able to understand this book and see that it is not mainly a book of judgment but a book for God's building
God's judgment is carried out by Christ's being the One with seven flaming eyes to burn, enlighten, search, purify, and refine us
At the very beginning, in the book of Genesis, we have the tree of life and the flowing river producing gold, bdellium , and precious stones
At the end of the Bible, in Revelation, we have a city built with these precious materials, with gold, pearl, and precious stones
The whole Bible is for God's eternal purpose of securing His eternal dwelling place by dispensing Himself as life into His chosen ones
You may say that you are spiritual or holy, but your spirituality and holiness must be tested by the church life
Or are you one who is saved, who fears God, who loves the Lord, and who prays, but who says, 'I don't care about the church'?
Do you say, 'It is not good to talk so much about the church; it is better to be alone with the Lord and read the Bible'?
After the Israelites entered into the good land, they built the temple as the center of their life as God's people
When they were right with the temple, they were right with God, and when they were wrong with the temple, they were wrong with God
He said that they were neither hot nor cold, but rather that they were lukewarm and therefore qualified for being vomited out of His mouth
If we would understand the prophecy of this book, we must realize that the secret of God's economy is sealed with seven seals
As we have pointed out, the scroll in chapter five is the new testament enacted by Christ with His precious blood
We have seen that the first four seals are not consecutive but simultaneous and that the fifth and sixth seals are consecutive
The seventh seal consists of the seven trumpets, and the seventh trumpet consists, in part, of the seven bowls
Some may have the concept that the seven trumpets follow the seven seals and that the seven bowls succeed the seven trumpets
Like the first four seals, the first four trumpets, which are not yet the direct judgment on men, form one group
Before the seven trumpets, there will already have been a judgment on the earth and on the hosts of the heavens at the sixth seal
At the seventh trumpet, there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun through the seven bowls
To repeat, the seven trumpets are the content of the seventh seal, and the seven bowls are a part of the seventh trumpet
Only God could have written the book of Revelation because only He has the wisdom to compose it in such a marvelous way
That the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are not consecutive reveals God's wisdom in writing this book
If we do not have the light to see this arrangement, although we may read Revelation again and again, we shall still be confused
Because this occasion is so solemn, heaven becomes silent, an indication that something serious is about to take place
In the administration of God's judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing on the position of One who has been sent by God
Revelation specifically describes Christ as 'another Angel,' indicating that He is not a regular or common angel but a special Angel
As we pointed out in message twenty-one, in the Old Testament Christ was called the 'Angel of the Lord,' who was God Himself
Verse 4 says that 'the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God'
The answer to the saints' prayers is the execution of God's judgment upon the earth by the following seven trumpets
At the end of this age, people will be so rebellious against God that they will even declare to the whole universe that they are God
When we pray like this, the Angel sent by God will minister to God with our prayer, adding to it Himself as the incense
It is after the prayers of the saints in verses 3 through 5 have been answered that the seven angels are prepared to trumpet
While the whole earth is sinful, some parts of the earth are particularly hellish, devilish, satanic, demonic, and evil
According to Revelation 9, God's judgment of 'the third part' will still be used to warn the rebellious world to repent
In the same principle as the judgment upon the earth in the first trumpet, God will judge the third part of the sea
If you say that the seventy weeks refer to seventy periods of seven days, you will never have the proper interpretation of this passage
The destruction of the city and the sanctuary refers to the destruction of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem under Titus in A
The first seven weeks, forty-nine years, were for the finishing of the rebuilding of the street and wall of Jerusalem
The last seven years, the last week, will be the time when Antichrist will make an agreement with the Jewish people
The first half of the seven years will not be a time of tribulation, for during that time Antichrist will be friendly to the Jews
According to Revelation, the abomination of desolation will be the image of Antichrist set up as an idol in the temple
By this we see that the great tribulation, which begins in the middle of the last seven years, will be only three and one-half years long
In this portion of the Word we see that Satan will be cast down from heaven to earth at the beginning of the last half of the seven years
The great tribulation will start at the beginning of the last three and one-half years when Satan is cast down from heaven to earth
The locusts here are not like the locusts in Exodus 10:12-15, because they have tails like scorpions and stings and they injure man
They must be demon-possessed ones, because they come out of the smoke which issues from the dwelling place of the demons
The plagues of the first four trumpets are not directly upon man, whereas the woes of the last three trumpets are
Those who will not be injured by the demon-possessed locusts are the Israelites who have the seal of God on their foreheads
These locusts are like an army similar to the locusts mentioned in the book of Joel where we are told that God will send an army of locusts
Although the torment of the first woe will damage man directly, the time will still be limited by God to a period of five months
During these five months, those who are tormented by these dreadful, demon-possessed locusts would rather die than live
In Hebrew the angel of the abyss is called Abaddon, which means destruction, as in Job 26:6; 28:22; and Proverbs 15:11
The Caesar into which this spirit will enter will be killed and will be resurrected with the spirit of Caesar Nero
Satan will then release the locusts which will be organized as an army under the rule of the beast, Antichrist, who will be their king
According to the Bible, the universe is composed of three sections: the heavens, the earth, and the region under the earth
The heavenly people should not be there, for God has no intention of leaving us on earth with the remnant of Israel
As we have seen, Satan will be cast from heaven to earth and will have the key to open the abyss and release the demon-possessed locusts
Finally, introducing the last woe, 11:14 says, 'The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming swiftly'
According to the pure Word, if we want to be raptured before the tribulation, we must be mature and ready for Him to take us from this earth
As chapter five reveals, Christ comes into this scene as the unique One worthy to open the secret of God's economy
He will shake the universe as a warning to those who dwell on the earth and as an introduction to the coming great tribulation
The great tribulation mentioned in Matthew 24:21 is composed of the three woes of the fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpets
It is not as clear cut as the woe of the fifth trumpet, which is caused by the collaboration of Satan and Antichrist
The blood of the atonement was put upon the four horns of the golden altar, the incense altar, for atonement, that is, for redemption
Undoubtedly, the four angels 'which are bound at the great river Euphrates' are four evil, fallen, rebellious angels who followed Satan
The Western world has invented so many modern methods of transportation, but these cavalry from the east will not use them
The horses' tails here, being like serpents, are more poisonous than the locusts' tails, which are like scorpions
These troops will move from east to west and, passing through the Euphrates, will come to the richest region on earth-the Middle East
As verse 16 of the same chapter says, 'And they gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon'
These two hundred million cavalry troops from the east and the armies from the north and the west will be gathered together there
During the last three and one-half years, Satan and Antichrist will do their best to injure people, and God will judge the earth
After the Euphrates has been dried up, the eastern kings and their armies will cross over it on their way to Armageddon
As we have seen, all the armies of the world will be gathered there to seize the riches that are in that region
As Revelation 19:15 says, Christ will tread 'the winepress of the wine of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty'
In chapter fourteen, we firstly have the firstfruit , secondly, the harvest , and, thirdly, the treading of the winepress
The assembling of the armies of the world at the place called Armageddon is likened to the gathering of grapes into a winepress
When Christ comes back to earth, He will destroy these evil fighters, treading the winepress of the fury of God
When these cavalry troops reach the Euphrates, immediately prior to the battle at Armageddon, the sixth bowl will be poured out
Undoubtedly, we are very close to the time of the sixth seal, the main aspect of which is the great earthquake
We know what will take place in the fifth seal, what will transpire at the sixth seal, and what will be the first four trumpets
The earth will be shaken, the sea will be damaged, the rivers will be made bitter, and the heavenly hosts will be darkened
Although God intends that, through His judgment, men would repent, these verses show that they will not repent
The seven seals, which are God's complete move on the earth and in the universe, are the content of God's economy
As a result of this shaking and judgment, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for man to live in peacefully
The sixth seal and the first five trumpets are closely related to one another in time, for there is not much of an interval between them
After the woe of the sixth trumpet, there will be the seven bowls as the last woe and as a part of the content of the seventh trumpet
If we would understand the book of Revelation, we must know which sections are continuations and which are insertions
That chapter shows the vision of the marking of the remnant of Israel and the vision of the rapture of God's redeemed ones
Even at the time of the sixth bowl, during the gathering at Armageddon, Christ will give the warning that He is coming as a thief
He will be wrapped in the cloud until chapter fourteen, when He will sit on the cloud and His coming will become public
It also indicates that He is the One who will execute judgment according to the One sitting on the throne with the rainbow round about it
Surely here close to His coming to the earth openly He will not be like the morning star which appears before the darkest time prior to dawn
In Joshua, God told the people that they would possess whatever part of the land the sole of their foot would tread upon
The mention of 'days' in verse 7 indicates that the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet will last a period of days
In the dispensation from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ, everything was unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery
At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, not only God's judgment of wrath upon the earth, but also 'the mystery of God also is finished'
When non-Christians receive too much money in change from a cashier in a restaurant, they are pleased and consider it a bargain
He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey'
When we receive the divine revelation by devouring it it is sweet in our eating but it becomes bitter in our digestion in our experience
As we read these life-study messages, they may be sweet to our taste, but in our experience they will all become bitter
Eventually, however, there will be no tears in our eyes, for we shall only enjoy the waters from the 'springs of waters of life'
Verse 11 says, 'And they said to me, You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings'
From the side of Antichrist, he will seize control of Jerusalem, but from God's side, God will give Jerusalem over to him
As we shall see, these two witnesses will not be new people, but two who were present in Old Testament times-Moses and Elijah
As we come to this portion of the Word, we must keep these three things in mind-the time, the place, and the witnesses
According to Matthew 24:15 and 21, these last three and a half years must be the time of the great tribulation
During these three and a half years, heaven will be preserved because Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to earth
Christ and the overcomers will fight downward to the earth until they reach Armageddon and destroy the army of Antichrist
In the last three and a half years there will be no trace of Satan in heaven, and heaven will be wholly preserved
At that time, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet, a devilish company, will be on earth doing everything possible to corrupt it
We see that the earthly temple, Jerusalem on earth, will be given over to destruction by Antichrist and the nations
For centuries, the law represented by Moses and the prophets represented by Elijah have been God's witnesses on earth
These two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, and the two sons of oil standing before the Lord of the earth
The olive trees mentioned in verse 4 produce oil for the lamps, and the lampstands give light with the oil of the olive trees
While he exercises his evil power and persecution the two witnesses prophesy speak for God and testify against the evil doings of Antichrist
They will not preach the gospel of gladness, but will warn people to stay away from God's judgment and from the worship of Antichrist
Verse 5 says, 'And if anyone desires to injure them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies
Christ, the embodiment of God, will descend with an army of overcomers to fight against Antichrist, 'the man of lawlessness'
Their corpses will not be buried but will be left on the street of the great city, where their Lord was crucified, for a show of shame
In the restoration of the nation of Israel, which began in 1948, the Jews returned to their father's land in unbelief
They will become as sinful as Sodom and as worldly as Egypt until the return of Christ, their Messiah, when 'all Israel will be saved'
Revelation chapter eleven does not even call the city Jerusalem but the great city referring to it as the place where the Lord was crucified
At the time of the persecution and destruction by Antichrist, Jerusalem will have become as sinful as Sodom and as worldly as Egypt
During the great tribulation, the two witnesses will give an adequate testimony for God and against Antichrist
These two witnesses, who will be physically killed, will be suddenly and miraculously resurrected and raptured to the heavens
Thousand of them will be killed by this earthquake because they take the lead not to believe in the Lord Jesus
Today, so many Jewish philosophers, doctors, political scientists, and financiers are sinful and worldly, not believing in the Lord Jesus
In whatever the Arab nations attempt to do to destroy the nation of Israel today they will not succeed because the Lord takes care of Israel
According to Zechariah 12, this persecution will bring the persecuted Jews to the point of looking to the One whom they pierced
At this juncture, Christ will come back, and all the tribes of the Holy Land will see the very Redeemer they pierced two thousand years ago
After the seven thousand men of renown are killed by this earthquake, the rest of the people will be terrified and will give glory to God
In each of the first six trumpets, only one item will transpire, but in the seventh trumpet many things will take place
The third woe, consisting of the seven bowls of God's wrath , is a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet
At the sounding of the seventh trumpet, not only will the great tribulation be ended, but also this age will be closed
The mystery of God will be finished and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ
The phrase 'He shall reign forever and ever' refers to the Lord's reign for eternity in the new heaven and the new earth
Wrath' here refers to the wrath of the seven bowls in chapter sixteen, which are a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet
The bowls will be poured out, not upon the earth or heaven, but upon man, especially upon Antichrist and his kingdom
The seven bowls of the third woe will be like seven bombs dropped from heaven and used by God to demolish Antichrist and his kingdom
Verse 15 says that the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ and that He will reign forever and ever
Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that the dead saints are in heaven and that when the Lord Jesus comes, they will descend with Him
The saints will not come down; they will rise up and, with the living ones, will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air
Its purpose will be to determine who among the saved persons will be worthy of a reward and who will need further discipline
The giving of the reward to the prophets and to the saints will occur after the resurrection and rapture of the saints
At the last trumpet, the dead saints will be resurrected and, with the living ones, will be caught up into the air
It is not scriptural to say that the rapture of the majority of the saints will take place before the tribulation
Paul says that the living saints will not precede the dead ones, and that at the last trumpet the dead saints will be resurrected
At the time of the seventh trumpet, the dead saints will be resurrected and the living saints will be raptured with them to the air
It will be after He fights the war at Armageddon and destroys Antichrist, the false prophet, and their followers
Many think that this judgment refers to the judgment exercised upon Christians to determine who is real and who is false
Matthew 25:32 also says, 'He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats'
The destroyers of the earth include the great Babylon , Antichrist , the false prophet , Satan , and the people who follow them
The great Babylon, the false religion, the Roman Catholic Church, must also be considered as a destroyer of the earth
Since she is a destroyer of the earth and the whole earth has been corrupted by her, the Lord will destroy her
After destroying the great Babylon, the Lord will destroy Antichrist, the false prophet, and their followers at the war of Armageddon
For God's judgment, the throne with the rainbow is the center, and for God's building, His temple with His ark is the center
Because of this, the view, the scene, the sight, in heaven is changed from the throne with the rainbow to the temple with the ark
The first section, consisting of chapters one through eleven, affords us a brief sketch, a general view of things
The following section consisting of chapters twelve through twentytwo gives us the details of the main items contained in the first section
During the past one and a half centuries, the rapture of the saints has been a troublesome matter for many seeking Christians
Those in the school of partial rapture say that the overcomers will be raptured earlier than the majority of the believers
In the Bible we see two aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the saints
When we come to chapter twelve, we shall see that the man-child, like the woman clothed with the sun, is a symbol
The man-child, which includes all the dead overcomers, is different from the firstfruit, who are the living overcomers
Exodus 23:19 clearly says, 'The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God'
The crop is Gods people and the first of the crop to ripen is the firstfruit which will be brought directly to Gods temple in the heavens
After that transpires, the sunshine will become brighter, and the unripened crops, which are still green, will begin to ripen
The harvest is stored in the barn, but the firstfruit is brought into the farmhouse for the farmer's first taste
While many teachers have written concerning the rapture, most of them have not taken care of this matter of God's crop
Rather, selecting a few verses as their basis, they teach that all Christians will be raptured before the tribulation
Some who knew that it was in the vicinity of Ball and Euclid have spent as much as an hour looking for Arden Place
Although it was correct to say that we lived near Ball and Euclid, the precise spot, Arden Place at Juno, was somewhat hidden
Matthew 2422 says And except those days were cut short no flesh at all would be saved but because of the elect those days shall be cut short
Eating drinking and the cares of this life are the three main elements of the devilish snare the net used by Satan to trap everyone on earth
In these verses in Luke, the Lord Jesus is saying that the time will come when all the dwellers on earth will be snared
Although there is the grave danger of being snared by eating drinking and the cares of this life we still need to live a normal human life
Although the Lord might come tomorrow, because of your laziness, He may tarry until you have learned to study and have graduated from school
It does not say that two are sleeping, fellowshipping, or living wholly for the Lord without engaging in any work
Learn to be balanced, falling neither into the extreme of idleness nor into the extreme of being occupied with the affairs of this life
In his epistles Paul seemed to be saying, 'While we are waiting for the Lord's coming back, we must still live in a normal way'
As those who are waiting for the Lord's coming back, we must have a proper living without being snared by anything
As long as they have a place to lie down, they are satisfied, thinking that they can spend their time reading the Bible or spiritual books
The Lord may tell them, 'You must learn to make your bed early in the morning, comb your hair, and shine your shoes
Much of your praising and fellowshipping may not be in His presence, but may simply be according to your own choice
Another aspect of the need for the rapture of the overcomers is that the trial is coming on the whole inhabited earth
By then, he will know that his time is short and thus he will do everything possible to torment man to the uttermost
After the great dragon, Satan, has come down to earth, he will be angry with the woman and will go to war with the remnant of her seed
The woman in chapter twelve is the totality of God's people, including both the church and the children of Israel
Speaking of Antichrist, Revelation 13:7 says, 'And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them'
The overcomers will be fully strengthened to escape the snare and to stand in the presence of the Lord in the heavens
Some among us, especially the young people, may love the Lord and think that they need not care for their human living
If you truly love the Lord, you must realize that while you are loving Him, you must still earn a living for yourself
At the time of the rapture of the overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven and have come down to the air
Probably most Christians know that 1 Thessalonians 4 says that those who are alive and remain will be caught up to the air
With respect to both time and place, the rapture of the overcomers is absolutely different from the rapture of the majority of the believers
If you cannot pray while you are working, then your prayer must not be very genuine; rather, it must be a formal, religious performance
The best prayer is that while you are busy working, you constantly and simultaneously look unto the Lord with a living spirit
As two brothers will be working in the field, much to their surprise, one will suddenly be taken away and the other will be left
Many Christians who care for the Lord's coming back hold the concept that since the Lord is coming soon, it is better for them to do nothing
Throughout the centuries, the saints were persecuted and martyred because they were faithful to the Lord's word
Lastly, if we would share in the first rapture, we must overcome degraded Christianity and keep the Lord's works
The Roman Catholic Church even denies this, for it does not teach people to trust in the Lord's death for their salvation
In doing this, those in the Roman Catholic Church forsake the Lord's work in His crucifixion for our redemption
The Roman Catholic Church also denies the Lord's resurrection; it absolutely forgets whatever the Lord has done
Catholicism even teaches that by offering a financial gift you can shorten the time that a relative will spend in purgatory
Don't trust your good deeds-your contributions, your prayers to the saints, your fastings, and your sufferings'
Catholicism teaches that Christ is the Son of Mary, but in the epistle to Thyatira, the Lord Jesus said that He is the Son of God
Since Catholicism has ignored the works of Christ, those in Catholicism will not be raptured before the tribulation
Rather, according to Revelation 17:16, God will use Antichrist and his ten kings to kill many of those in the Roman Catholic Church
In verses 6 through 13 there is the persecution under Antichrist, who will set up his image and force people to worship it
According to Revelation 14, there are two kinds of rapture: the rapture of the firstfruit and the rapture of the harvest
Thessalonians 4:15 says that those who 'are living, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have slept'
If it were not so, the apostle Paul would never have used the word remain; he simply would have used the word alive
At that time, some of the living saints will already have been taken up to the throne of God in the third heaven
Some propound this interpretation because they teach that all the saints will be raptured before the tribulation
The teaching that all the believers will be raptured before the tribulation is absolutely not according to the Scriptures
Thessalonians 2 gives us a strong basis for saying that the rapture of the majority of believers will be at the end of the great tribulation
Whenever those in Newton's group placed these verses before those in Darby's group, those in Darby's group were embarrassed
According to Revelation 12, the man-child will be caught up to the throne of God prior to the last three and one-half years
The majority of the believers will still remain on earth and will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation
Thessalonians 4:17 reveals that the place is 'in the air,' and Revelation 14:14-16 indicates that it will be 'on the cloud'
Revelation may be considered as being close to doctrine, but manifestation is definitely related to experience
The Bible not only gives us the doctrine but also the experience, not only the revelation of God, but also the manifestation of God
The children of Israel as a corporate people signify that the church is also a corporate people to express God
In Exodus we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to
That the stone has seven eyes, which are the seven eyes of God, indicates that these seven eyes infuse what God is into us
Zechariah 4:2-6 and 10 also imply that these seven eyes of God, which are the seven lamps of the lampstand, are the Spirit
Zechariah is not the book of consummation, and we must continue until we come to the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation
As we consider Exodus 25, Zechariah 3 and 4, and the book of Revelation, we see four aspects of the lampstand that we must experience
Along with the form, we must experience the expression of the lampstand through the shining of the seven lamps
They have so little of the substance, of the divine gold; instead of acquiring the substance, they discuss vain doctrine
According to the context of John 4, to worship God is to drink of Him as the living water , which is the very Spirit flowing into our being
We may have a thousand talents of gold and not yet have the lampstand, for we may just have the substance without the form
One brother may have ten pounds of gold, another may have seven pounds, and still another may have five pounds
Many people argue with us about the church, asking how we can say that we are the church and that they are not the church
You may even have a great deal of gold, but if you do not have the form, by the way of the building, you do not have the lampstand
Rather, we would realize that whatever we gain or receive of the divine element is for the building of the lampstand
All such functions are not genuine functions but performances, because the saints are not filled with the Spirit
When a tire becomes flat, it is better not to roll it around, for the more you roll it, the more damaged it will become
All the local churches as the many lampstands are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit as the one lampstand
It is actually a multiplication of the wonderful expression of Christ as the life-giving Spirit in a practical way
By means of this reproduction, the Lord will have a beachhead on which to place His feet for His coming back to possess the whole earth
Revelation 3:12 has been a difficult verse for all expositors because none of them has had the adequate experience
What does it mean to have the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the new name of the Lord written upon us?
There is no way except to be transformed from clay into precious stone and then to be built into God's building
Prior to 312 we have the Lords promise in 217 that indicates that we can be transformed into a white stone by eating Him as the hidden manna
We in the churches must see that the Lord's greatest blessing is that He promises us to make us become something
As water flows through it, it carries away the natural wooden element and replaces it with a solid mineral element
The true blessing is that He is making us a pillar in the temple of God on which are written three wonderful names
Although many stress edification, no one cares for the practical building of the church of God which issues in His eternal dwelling place
When we come to the last two chapters of the Bible we do not find religion morality ethics or edificationwe see a city the New Jerusalem
It reaches the ultimate consummation of the entire Bible, for both the Bible and this epistle consummate with the New Jerusalem
Day by day, you embrace the Bible, endeavoring to be fundamentally correct in doctrine, but what about your being?
The twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem are layers of precious stones , and the entire wall is built with jasper
You may know many things, but every part of you may still be mud or wood, indicating that you have not been transformed
Every day, something of God flows in to carry away my natural element and to replace it with His divine essence'
The natural life and the natural love are not frankincense; they are the honey that is hateful in the eyes of God
Our natural essence and element must be carried away by the flow of the divine life and replaced with God's divine element
The only way is by transforming us, that is, by carrying away our natural element and by replacing it with His divine essence
He patiently works Himself into us as the divine flow, not to correct our outward behavior but to carry away our natural essence
Although you have been saved from sin and the world, have you been transformed and have you been built up with others?
In brief it means that the Lord Jesus as the building stone was engraved dealt with by God on the cross for the iniquity of Gods people
In Revelation chapters four and five, we have a new and further development of the seven eyes and the seven lamps
In 4:5 the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in 5:6 the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God
We have a further development over Zechariah for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes on the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb
In Zechariah 3 and 4 we see the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of the Lord
Eventually, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb who is in the very center of God's administration
In eternity past there was the Word, and in eternity future there will be Bethel, the house, the dwelling of God
In chapters four and five we see that the seven Spirits are the seven lamps and the seven eyes mentioned in Zechariah
As the Lamb, He took away all the sins, the iniquity, of God's people on the day God engraved Him on the cross
In the eyes of God, when the Jewish builders rejected Him, they not only rejected the Lamb, but also the cornerstone of God's building
All the enemies have been defeated, all the sins have been removed, and He has become the stone for God's building
On this stone there are seven eyes, shining and burning before the throne of God to carry out God's eternal economy
Everyone in the church life has experienced this shining that searched out and judged things that were concealed in the depths of our being
According to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate and distinct Persons
For us today, the Trinity should not be a doctrinal matter; it must be the experience of the Triune God dispensing Himself into us
We have seen that, according to the Gospel of John, the eternal Word, who is God, became flesh, and that this flesh was the Lamb of God
The Lamb is also the stone with the seven eyes, and these eyes are the seven enlightening, searching, exposing, and judging lamps
We should not have a Trinity in doctrine, but experience the wonderful, mysterious, and excellent riches of our God
All these riches are not only for our redemption and regeneration, but also for our transformation and building up
Rather, we should ignore what the opposers are saying and hold to the Bible, with the pure word and the up-to-date light
Whenever we attempt to understand the Bible in a 'theological' way or come to the Bible seeking theology, we shall be killed
Let us now consider further some of the crucial terms found in the Gospel of John and in the book of Revelation
John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, said of this Word who had become flesh, 'Behold, the Lamb of God'!
One of the angelic elders, not a human being, introduced Christ in this way, recommending Him as the Lion of the tribe of Judah
In other words, the Redeemer who took away the sin of the world has become the building stone, the building One
He knew that He would be engraved by God to take away the iniquity of God's people in one day so that God could have His building
We have the Word, God, the flesh, the Lamb, the Lion, the stone, the seven eyes, the seven Spirits, and the seven lamps
If we would pray over these ten items, we would see the vision that the New Jerusalem is the consummate enlargement of God
Some of the so-called inner life Christians have proceeded a little further and speak about the overcoming Lion
If He had not defeated the enemy and removed iniquity, there would have been no way for Him to accomplish God's building work
These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God, and the seven Spirits of God are the seven burning, flaming lamps
As we have already mentioned, the seven Spirits of God are for the imparting of life because, in the Bible, the Spirit is the Spirit of life
After we were in the church, we experienced something shining in us to search out every secret of our entire life
Ultimately, this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate and eternal enlargement of our wonderful God
The first section of the book of Revelation, composed of the first eleven chapters, covers all things to eternity
The first four seals cover the nearly two thousand years of history from the time of Christ's ascension until the end of this age
The first four trumpets are supernatural calamities, God's judgment upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars
These four trumpets will damage heaven and earth, causing the earth to no longer be a suitable place on which mankind can dwell
Since mankind has continually disappointed God, rebelling against Him, God will eventually declare that His toleration has come to an end
When we get into the new heaven and new earth and live in the New Jerusalem, we shall have a much fuller vision than we have now
She is under the shining of the twelve stars, above the shining of the moon, and enveloped with the shining of the sun
Anything that is in darkness is bound and imprisoned, but anything that is in the light is released and emancipated
In Jeremiah 3:14 the Lord tells His children that He is married to them, and in Jeremiah 31:32 He says that He is a husband to them
In His economy God's redeemed people are always considered by Him as His wife, and God considers Himself as their husband
Some Christian teachers have held the concept that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, and that the man-child is Jesus
These twelve hundred sixty days are three and a half years or forty-two months , which will be the period of the great tribulation
1217 proves that this woman does not only comprise those who keep the commandments of God but also those who have the testimony of Jesus
In Joseph's dream, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars plus Joseph himself signified the total composition of God's people on earth
The moon is under the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars
As individual stars, they are a crown for this universal woman, symbolizing the glory of God's grace and His economy exalted
The patriarchs who are in the principle of Gods grace were not under the law hence they were a crown exalted above the head of the woman
The church composed of all the believers symbolized by the sun shines collectively in the day with the glory of God
That the church is the major part of God's people is indicated by the fact that the sun clothes the woman's body
The millennial kingdom will be a greater day because at that time the light of the sun will be seven times stronger than it is today
Although there are some Jewish believers among us, they are no longer a part of the moon but a part of the sun
The woman in chapter twelve is not only universal both in time and in space, but is also bright in celestial light
The woman is now much greater, the serpent has become a great dragon, and the seed of the woman has also developed into the man-child
We need the vision to see in this universe the sign of a great universal bright woman travailing in birth to bring forth a child
In the universe today just one war is raging-the war between God's people as the woman and the serpent as the dragon
In chapter seventeen, we see a beast with seven heads and ten horns, the same number of heads and horns that the dragon has
The apostate Catholic Church, being the prostitute riding on the beast, is one with the dragon in persecuting the bright woman
They did not realize that they were fighting together with the dragon to persecute God's people and to damage and frustrate God's economy
According to their opinion, everything they did, including sentencing Christ to death, was according to their Scriptures
Until the sovereign Lord intervened as Saul was on the way to Damascus, Saul also was actively a part of the dragon
By the example of Saul of Tarsus we see that whoever persecutes the church today is part of the dragon or at least one with him
The dragon will be cast down from the heavens to the earth, then from the earth to the abyss, and finally from the abyss to the lake of fire
Although that sign appears simple, it covers the Gentile powers from Babylon to the coming kingdoms of the revived Roman Empire
To say that the woman is merely Israel, the race of the Jews, is also inadequate, for the woman in this vision is not local but universal
In order to accomplish His purpose, God not only needs the individual Christ but also a corporate Christ, the church, God's people
God needs the man-child to defeat His enemy and to bring in His kingdom that His eternal purpose might be accomplished
In the great sign in Revelation 12, the woman is not portrayed as doing anything for her husband; she is pictured as being pregnant
Her duty is to receive something of Christ that she may be made pregnant of Christ and may bring forth something for Christ
When Christians speak about submission, their concept is to do something for Christ, to perform some work for God
As the proper woman, we must firstly submit ourselves to our husband, not to do something for Him, but to receive something of Him
We commit fornication when on the one hand we admit that Christ is our husband while on the other hand we submit to so many other things
As a chaste wife, you should not submit to anyone other than your husband, and you should not receive anything from anyone else
To receive something other than Christ, even if that thing is good or even scriptural, is to commit spiritual fornication
When we receive something uniquely of Christ, we shall be made pregnant of Christ to bring forth the man-child
Because Christianity has been impregnated of things other than Christ, hardly anything that it brings forth is the man-child
He is brought forth by Christ's getting into part of the woman to constitute that part of her with all the rich element of Christ
Even if you submit yourselves to Christ and receive something of Him, you are still the woman and are not yet the man-child
If you are not a part of the man-child today, then how do you expect to be a part of the man-child in resurrection?
The principle in becoming the firstfruit or the man-child is the same: we must follow the Lamb wherever He goes
We must permit the element of Christ, the divine constituent of Christ, to work in us continually to saturate and permeate our whole being
We cannot produce or manufacture this man-child; we must receive something of Christ and be made pregnant of Him
It is absolutely a matter of opening our being to His divine element and of allowing this element to be worked into us
In this warfare we must touch the throne, call upon the highest authority, and exercise our spirit to fight the battle
As the woman, we must submit to our husband, open to Him, and receive something of Him that His element might be wrought into our being
What is the significance of being humble, nice, holy, or spiritual as long as the man-child, or even the woman, is not with us today?
At times, even the dear saints are utilized by the enemy to cause questions, to make proposals, and to raise doubts
Although thousands of concepts may be presented to you, you will say, 'I will receive nothing of these concepts
If we submit ourselves to our one husband and only receive something of Him, we shall be chaste and we shall be one
In Genesis 3:15 the woman was local and individual; the seed, Christ, was also individual; and the serpent was a small snake
These are considered in the Bible as a collective unit fighting the battle for God and bringing God's kingdom down to earth
During the time of Israel, there were hundreds of thousands who belonged to God, but only a few of them were strong
Although we all have come into the Lord's recovery, we should not say that everyone in the recovery will be an overcomer
How much you share of God's grace will determine whether or not you will be a strong one among God's people in the Lord's recovery
If you are like this, then it is possible that you will be the stronger part in the Lord's recovery, the stronger part within the woman
Whether or not you will be in the man-child depends upon how you react to God's desire, God's move, and God's eternal economy
Not only the Lord's economy but even His recovery today depends upon the stronger ones, not upon the indifferent ones
As a seed of the woman, he was part of the woman and was persecuted by his brother Cain, who was part of the serpent
The serpent who damaged Eve in Genesis 3 subtly crept into Cain in Genesis 4, making him a part of the serpent
It was not Cain who murdered his brother, but, according to John 8:44, it was Satan, the serpent, who murdered Abel
When the apostle Paul was Saul of Tarsus, persecuting the church and laying it waste, he was part of the serpent
Those Christians who will refuse to worship the image of Antichrist will be the later overcomers mentioned in Revelation 15
In his history of martyrs, Foxe says that the Roman Catholic Church has killed more saints than the Roman Empire did
Although they would persecute you for the sake of preserving their religion, they would not realize that they are part of the great dragon
Acts 13:33 and 34, a quotation of Psalm 2:7, reveal that when He was resurrected, He was begotten as the Firstborn Son of God
If you are an overcomer and die before the Lord comes back, you will be resurrected to be part of the man-child
The manchild brought forth in verse 5 is composed of the brothers in verse 10 who have been opposed and accused by Satan the enemy of God
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by loving not their soul life even unto death
Any apparent condemnation that does not stop after we have confessed and applied the blood must be of the Devil
During that time, we did a great deal of gospel preaching in China and often we had to conquer cases of demon possession
A number of times, demon-possessed females took scissors and, as we were praying, threatened to cut us with them
Demons, you must realize that your king and leader, Satan, the Devil, has been crucified and that you and he have been judged'
We must always apply the blood, telling the Devil that although we are not perfect, we are under the perfect blood
Along with testifying to the demons, you need to preach to Satan, saying, 'Satan, don't you know that you have been crucified on the cross?
The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers as mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17
There, the rapture of the majority of the believers will be to the air and at the last trumpet , which will be the seventh trumpet
After the rapture of the man-child, there will be the final three and a half years, or the twelve hundred sixty days
During this period of time, the dragon will do everything possible to damage the man created by God for His purpose
Because up until now God has not yet gained the man-child, He has not had a way to cast Satan from heaven to earth
Because the serpent has been eating a great deal throughout the centuries, he has been enlarged into a great dragon
The dragon is not only great because of his eating, but is also red because of his murdering so many overcomers throughout the years
The Roman Empire, like the two legs of this great image, was divided into two sections-the western Roman Empire and the eastern Roman Empire
The third part of the stars of heaven' should be the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God
After the man-child has been raptured to the heavens, he will no longer tolerate Satan's presence in the heavens
At that time, the earth will be filled with fallen angels who will damage the dwelling place of rebellious man
Verse 4 says that 'the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child'
From the time of Genesis 3:15 to this day, Satan has been continually fighting against the woman with the intention of devouring her child
During the last three and a half years Satan will oppose that part of Gods people who will be left on the earth during the great tribulation
Satan is not only God's enemy outside of God's kingdom, but also God's adversary rebelling against God from within God's kingdom
It is easy to defend yourself against an enemy, but it is difficult to defend yourself against an adversary because he is within you
After we repented, were saved, and received grace, the adversary subtly came to us, causing us to think that we were so dirty and so bad
Everyone on earth, from the highest to the lowest and from the greatest to the least, is being deceived by Satan
Verse 13 says, 'And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child'
As we have seen, this has not yet taken place because the man-child has not yet been brought forth and raptured to the heavens
Otherwise, you will be part of the woman left to pass through the major part of the last three and a half years
Three unclean spirits like frogs will proceed out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet
These unclean spirits will go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty
Among them, some will be the Jews 'who keep the commandments of God,' and some will be the believers who 'have the testimony of Jesus'
Satan will not only persecute the woman, but will make war with the rest of her seed, with the weaker part of the woman
Verse 14 says, 'And the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman that she might fly into the wilderness into her place'
Since its beginning, the United States has been a land to which people who desire a free conscience toward God might escape
Verse 16 says, 'The earth helps the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth'
When God sends the earthquakes during the great tribulation, earth will no longer be a good place on which man can dwell peacefully
If you do not have this vision, you will be blind, not knowing what is taking place on earth or in the universe
According to the vision, the whole woman does not fight; the stronger part within her does the fighting against the dragon
Following that, there is the need of the overcoming believers to carry out that judgment, to execute that sentence
The fighting waged by the overcoming believers against Satan is actually the execution of the Lord's judgment upon him
Who will go to heaven to execute God's judgment and command the condemned, judged, and sentenced enemy to depart?
The angels lack the position to do this because, being angels, they are on the same level as Satan who formerly was among them
In Christianity you probably never heard that God has an eternal purpose and that we must fulfill God's purpose
Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, a war commences with Michael and his angels against Satan
What we need to do is to take the covenant, the word of God, and preach to Satan regarding what the Lord has accomplished for us
Go to the source of the problem-Satan-and preach to him, saying, 'Satan, you have been crucified on the cross'
As soon as this word is uttered by the man-child, Michael the archangel will lead all his angels to war against the dragon
After defeating Satan on earth, we shall fight upward to heaven and eventually we shall fight downward to earth
After he has been cast down to earth to damage it, we shall descend and say to him, 'Satan, are you still here?
If you preach to Satan like this, you will become another person and will probably soon be included in the stronger part of the woman
Begin now to be qualified, equipped, and perfected to be among those who will be raptured to heaven to execute judgment upon Satan
Satan has constantly been troubling you, but after you decide to preach to him, he may run away, for he knows what you intend to do
According to the Bible, the principalities, powers, and authorities under Satan, rule over the countries on earth
All the rumors, criticisms, and opposition do not come from any human beings, but from Satan, who is behind them
Pray that many in the Lord's recovery may not only remain part of the woman but also become part of the man-child
After the man-child has been resurrected and raptured to heaven, he will not tolerate to see Satan in the heavens
When we see him, we shall not tolerate his presence there and we shall say, 'Satan, are you still in our God's sanctuary?
As we have seen, after we have spoken our executing word, the captain and his policemen will fight against the enemy
Gabriel is a reporter bringing news to God's people , whereas Michael is a fighter contending for God's people
Moses had to be present on the Mount of Transfiguration and, according to chapter eleven, he must return to be one of the two witnesses
After he has fallen from heaven to earth, he will use the key to the abyss to cause the torment of the fifth trumpet
After Satan, the heavenly star, has been cast down to earth, his time will be very short, only three and a half years
When the man-child is raptured to heaven and Satan is cast down from heaven to earth, that will be the time for the kingdom of God to come
We have participated in God's power and Christ's authority today, but our full enjoyment of them will be in the kingdom age
Since we are in the reality of the kingdom now, we shall certainly be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the future
We are fighting the dragon today and one day we shall be there in the heavens to give him the word to leave heaven
The whole pillar measured eighteen cubits, but half a cubit was lost in the joint between the pillar and the capital
Everything in the Bible, whether it is a narrative, a history, a type, a shadow, a prophecy, or a plain word, must be related to life
If we lack the experience in life, we shall be unable to apprehend the significance in life of many portions of the Word
If we would rightly interpret the woman in Revelation 12, we must check any proposed interpretation with our experience in life
To say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, is altogether too objective and has nothing to do with our experience
In chapter four we see the scene in heaven after the ascension of Christ, and in chapter eleven we see the eternal kingdom
At the very beginning of this second section we have the first of these important and crucial mattersa bright woman opposed by a red dragon
In chapters nineteen and twenty the woman is the bride, and in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two she is the wife
In chapters seventeen and eighteen we see Babylon the Great, the counterfeit of this woman, the counterfeit of Jerusalem
The link that connects chapters twelve and thirteen is the three and a half years, or the one thousand two hundred sixty days
Chapter thirteen is an addition to chapter twelve describing what will happen when the red dragon persecutes the woman
During this period of time a beast Antichrist will emerge from the sea and will be one with the dragon to war against the saints Gods people
It tells how Gods enemy is fighting against His people and how His people are producing the stronger part the manchild to defeat the enemy
We see that God's enemy will instigate Antichrist, the false prophet, and their followers to war against God's people
Although you may be one of God's people, the crucial question is whether or not you are standing here as God's people
There may be thirteen or fourteen million Jews on earth, but less than three million of them are in the nation of Israel
Although they are Jews and although their number exceeds the number of those in the nation of Israel, they are not the nation of Israel
Of the thirteen or fourteen million Jews, at least eleven million have lost the ground of the nation of Israel
Only those Israelites who returned to the land of their forefathers and who stand, live, and fight there are the nation of Israel
There are some Jews in New York City who are millionaires; they are much richer than the poor Jews who returned to Palestine
No matter how much they donate, still they are not the nation of Israel; they are citizens of the United States
To bring forth the man-child there is the need for at least a portion of God's people to come back to the proper standing of the woman
You are like the Jews in New York City who declare that they are Jews and that they are for the nation of Israel
They help the nation of Israel and they are for the nation of Israel, but they are not the nation of Israel in a practical way
Today it is not the scattered children of God, those who have lost their ground, who will bring forth the man-child
Smith, you must drop every other man and every other thing, and return purely, singly, and uniquely to be one with Mr
The sand of the sea here no doubt indicates the seashore of the Holy Land, the very edge of the nation of Israel
If we would understand the book of Revelation, we must trace the items found here back to their first mention in the Old Testament
The two animals in chapter eight, the ram and the goat, are equal to the second and third beasts mentioned in chapter seven
Eventually, the northern king will be a shadow, a type, of Antichrist, who is the little horn spoken of in chapter eight
After the sixty-ninth week, a prince, who was Titus, came to destroy Jerusalem, and Jerusalem was trodden under the feet of the Gentiles
Both in Daniel and in Revelation the beast out of the sea refers not only to the Roman Empire but specifically to Antichrist
As the Roman Empire conquered all the neighboring powers, so Antichrist will subdue and conquer all the powers around the Mediterranean Sea
In the vision in Daniel chapter seven these ten kingdoms represented by the ten kings are exalted as the ten horns
Worldly politics and worldly kingdoms are, in the eyes of God, like wild beasts which do nothing except damage and devour people
In the eyes of Nebuchadnezzar, that is, in human eyes, the worldly kingdoms seem to be a great and glorious image
When you see a brilliant and eloquent person speaking arrogant words and blaspheming God, you must take notice-he may be Antichrist
Antichrist will alter the Jewish religion, abolish the feasts, and change the laws they have received from God through their forefathers
Antichrist will be the fourth beast in Daniel chapter seven and also the little horn revealed in Daniel chapter eight
The revelation in Daniel chapter eight is mainly of two things-the ram signifying Persia and the goat signifying Greece
After Alexander's death, these generals occupied certain territories and out of them made kingdoms for themselves
As we read this prophecy, written long before Alexander's time, we cannot help but believe that the Bible was inspired by God
Near the time of her delivery, she journeyed to Bethlehem and stayed there just long enough for the Lord Jesus to be born
At this point let us consider, as a parenthesis, the historical fulfillment of Daniel 2:31-33, 38-45, and 7:3-7
The territories of the western Roman Empire included Gaul, Spain, Britain, Italy, and the western half of North Africa
The little horn will not only grow great to the south, to the east, and to the beautiful land, but even to the host of heaven
Daniel 8:10 also says that the little horn 'cast down some of the host and of the stars to the earth, and stamped upon them'
Something will be developed in the scientific field that will enable Antichrist to bring down the heavenly host
The Jews who have returned to the land of their fathers are presently in a very poor situation, full of sins and transgressions
God will be disgusted with their offerings, and, due to their transgression, He will allow Antichrist to cause the sacrifices to cease
Please remember that Antichrist is firstly the fourth beast of Daniel chapter seven and then the little horn of Daniel chapter eight
Between these two men who share one title, 'the prince,' there is an interval of approximately two thousand years
The seven weeks mentioned here are reckoned from the time the decree was issued by the Persian king to rebuild the city of Jerusalem
The sixty-two weeks are the period from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the day of Christ's crucifixion
From the completion of the rebuilding of the city to the crucifixion of the Messiah was four hundred thirty-four years
Between the time of the crucifixion of Christ and the beginning of the seventieth week is a gap of unknown duration
The last Caesar of the revived Roman Empire will be Antichrist, who will make a covenant with the Jews for one week
Antichrist will bring in both abominations or idols, and desolation or destruction, demolishing both the temple and the city of Jerusalem
When we come to Revelation chapter seventeen, we shall see that Antichrist will destroy Catholicism in addition to Judaism
Although some of us were formerly in one or the other, we praise the Lord that we are no longer in these 'isms'
Christmas is also demonic for December 25 the date of a pagan festival in honor of the birth of the sun is said to be the birthday of Christ
For this reason, in God's eyes the Catholic Church is the great prostitute who enriches herself by committing spiritual fornication
Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all'
Daniel 11:45 says, 'And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain'
As we consider all these points regarding Antichrist, we see what kind of person he will be and even where he will come from
Through the study of the prophecies concerning Antichrist, we may conclude that he is the ultimate issue of the worldly powers
In Gods eyes the worldly powers began with Babylon which was followed by the empire of MedoPersia the Macedonian Empire and the Roman Empire
To the church Christ is the building stone, but to the worldly powers He is the smiting stone which will smash the whole image to pieces
We have seen that Antichrist will come out of one of the four kingdoms of the ancient Macedonian Empire, probably out of Greece
Greece, which was part of the Roman Empire, will also be one of the ten kingdoms, or the ten toes, of the image
He will annul everything pertaining to Judaism, persecute the Jews and the Christians who are left on earth, and destroy Catholicism
Although this is the age of democracy, many are tired of the shortcomings of democracy and are looking for strong leadership
The fact that the beast which John saw 'was like a leopard' confirms our saying that Antichrist will be a Greek
All the characteristics of all the wild beasts will be synthesized in this one person, making him the all-inclusive beast
All these characteristics prefigure the various features of Antichrist, who will certainly be an extraordinary figure
Since we have seen the light in the Scriptures regarding Antichrist, no one will be able to cheat us with respect to him
As we have seen, in the Bible the Jewish territory is signified by the land and the Gentile world is signified by the sea
Because we have received this light regarding Antichrist, we should no longer listen to any loose interpretations
The seven heads of the beast are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire , signified by the seven diadems on the seven heads
The first Caesar was Julius, the fifth, Nero, and the sixth, Domitian, who was Caesar when John wrote the book of Revelation
The seventh Caesar who will eventually suffer a death blow and be resuscitated with the spirit of Nero the fifth Caesar will be Antichrist
According to history, all seven Caesars claimed to be God, assumed deity, and forced their people to worship them as God
According to the numerical evaluation of the Hebrew letters, the number of the name Caesar Nero equals six hundred sixty-six
When we come to chapter seventeen, we shall see that Antichrist will be resuscitated with the spirit of Caesar Nero
Antichrist will firstly be the seventh Caesar who will be assassinated, probably before the last three and a half years
Due to this counterfeit of the resurrection, the whole world will marvel after the beast , Antichrist, the counterfeit of Christ
At the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan will fall to the earth and will be given the key of the shaft of the abyss
Satan, the dragon, and Antichrist, the beast, will collaborate to torment and injure man whom God created for Himself
He will be consumed with rage, will be obsessed with a satanic hatred, and will bring destruction wherever he goes
When the apostle Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians, he must have been impressed regarding this man of sin from his knowledge of the book of Daniel
According to Daniel chapters eight and eleven, Antichrist will exalt himself above all gods and call himself God
Because Antichrist will be the representative of lawlessness and even its totality, the Bible calls him 'the lawless one'
Because he will be so sinful and lawless, he will become 'the son of destruction,' who will perish in an extraordinary way
In this short portion of the Word, Paul gives us three titles of Antichrist-the man of sin, the lawless one, and the son of destruction
Thessalonians 2:4 says that Antichrist 'opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped'
Thessalonians 2:4 also says that Antichrist 'seats himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God'
Because Gods purpose has not been fulfilled that is because the Bride has not yet been prepared God exercises His control over lawlessness
Eventually at the time of the last three and a half years this restraint will be removed and it will seem that God has said Let the world go
At that time, Antichrist, the lawless one, will be fully manifested, and the entire earth will be filled with lawlessness
We must believe that God has been and still is sovereign over all the world powers, having sovereignly prepared them in a certain way
The more wisdom we have and the more we get into these prophecies, the more nourishment we shall derive from them
In every line of Scripture, including these portions that are prophecies, there is some life element, some living nourishment
In verses 4 and 5 we see that the dragon 'gave authority to the beast' and that 'authority was given to him to act forty-two months'
That the dragon gives his power, his throne, and great authority to the beast indicates that he makes the beast one with him
Since that day, Satan has been looking for someone to whom he could give all the power, authority, and glory of his satanic kingdom
Revelation 13:3 says, 'And one of his heads was as if it had been slain to death, and his death stroke was healed'
Verse 12 says that his 'death stroke was healed,' and verse 14 says that the beast 'had the stroke of the sword and lived'
Antichrist will probably be slain in the middle of the last seven years, perhaps about the same time Satan is cast down from heaven to earth
After he has been slain and resuscitated, which will take place near the middle of these seven years, he will become the eighth Caesar
Before His death and resurrection Christ was limited in His flesh but after His death and resurrection He was given all authority and power
Satan will attempt to counterfeit this in order to prove to the world that his Antichrist is the same as Christ
After his resuscitation, being indwelt by the spirit of Caesar Nero, he will become all the more capable, intelligent, and powerful
At the same time, he will devise a way to mark them either with the name of Antichrist or with the number of his name
During the kingdom of the eighth Caesar, everyone must bear the name of Antichrist as the permit to buy and sell
Antichrist may then rise up and use the mass media to give a lecture in which he will claim to do something greater
While all this is taking place, everyone on earth will be talking about the rapture, and the Christians still on earth will testify about it
If the Christians remaining on earth during this time know about all these things, they will be greatly helped
The saints here are the rest of the woman's seed in 12:17, which consists of the God-fearing Jews and of the believers in Christ
As 11:11 reveals, after three and a half days the two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured to the heavens
Only those whose names have been written in the book of life before the foundation of the world will not marvel after him
As we shall see in the next message the false prophet will compel those who dwell on earth to make an image of the beast and to worship it
After Antichrist has been resuscitated, he will persecute every kind of religion, including Judaism and Catholicism
In the war at Armageddon, Christ will defeat Antichrist and the false prophet and will cast them alive into the lake of fire
Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, this beast, the false prophet, will come out of the Jewish nation
According to the record in the Bible, Elijah was raptured to God, and the body of Moses was kept by God for a specific purpose
Only when we come to the book of Revelation do we see why the Bible gives us this particular record of these four people
Two people have been kept by God for His positive purpose and two others have been kept for His negative purpose
The spirit of Nero is being held in the abyss until the time it will fully constitute the last Caesar of the Roman Empire as Antichrist
By God's sovereign keeping of these four people, we can see that the whole universe and the entire human race is under God's sovereign hand
During the three and a half years of the great tribulation, four special persons will be on earth-Moses, Elijah, Nero, and Judas
Geographically, he will come from underneath the earth, and symbolically he will come from the nation of Israel
The fact that the false prophet will have two horns like a lamb indicates that he will pretend to be the same as Christ
Verse 13 says, 'And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men'
Because the false prophet will perform great signs, it will be difficult for people to discern the real prophet from the false prophet
According to the concept of the New Testament, the Lord does not intend for us to devote our attention to signs
We should not care for what a preacher or minister can do in the way of signs; we must examine the kind of life he has
If both Elijah and Judas were standing before you, you could easily discern who is true and who is false by their very being
Although none of us is like Judas, part of our natural being is in the principle of Judas at least to some degree
Not only will Satan give his power to the false prophet; the Antichrist will place his complete confidence in him
Verse 12 also says, 'And he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed'
Many argue that the images set up in various places today are not idols and that people are not required to worship them
The desire for a hero will consummate in Antichrist, and the false prophet will convince the worldly people to worship their hero
If you are not a firstfruit, but are left on earth during the great tribulation, you may be martyred by Antichrist
Although those who are martyred during the great tribulation will be the late overcomers, they will become overcomers very quickly
For more than thirty years he suffered the persecution from Christianity by means of opposition, criticisms, and rumors
It will not be pleasant to be left to pass through the great tribulation, but it is a great deal better than dying today
Praise the Lord that we all have the opportunity to become overcomers, either the early overcomers or the late overcomers
As we have already pointed out, the name of the beast is Caesar Nero, and the number of his name is six hundred and sixty-six
As far as the beast and the false prophet are concerned, we cannot say that no impression has been made upon us
Although the King James Version uses the word able, the Greek word translated able means to be strengthened with power
In order to be the man-child, we must be not only strengthened in our inner man, but also nourished with all the riches of Christ
In the book of Ephesians we also have the warfare against spiritual darkness, against the principalities and powers in the heavenlies
We should not simply have one way of prayer but every means of prayer exercising our spirit to pray in various ways to take the word of God
Of trying to understand the book of Ephesians, you should pray-read it, even covering the whole book in two weeks
If we would fight against the principalities and powers in the heavenlies, we must firstly kill all the 'bugs' within us
When you listen to a message, fellowship with the saints, or read the Bible, you cling to many opinions and concepts
When you come to the Word, as a living person who is strong in thought, feeling, and judgment, you must ask the Lord to slay your opinions
What has frustrated you from being built up with others is not mainly your weakness or even your worldliness-it is your opinions
Some have been in the church life for more than ten years, but they are still not a part of the actual building
Many read the Word in a selective way, taking whatever matches their opinion and rejecting whatever does not match it
If you do not allow the Word to slay your opinions, you will not be able to reach the enemy in the air to do battle with him
You may think that you are a good husband, but you do not realize how strongly you cling to your opinions in relation to your wife
According to the implication of Ephesians 6, by pray-reading we take the killing word as the sword that is able to slay all our opinions
The only way to put on the helmet of salvation as our covering is to have our opinions and concepts subdued and killed
Only when your choice is killed will you be able to put on Christ as your breastplate to cover your conscience
In Revelation 12 we have the vision, and in Ephesians we have the practical way to come into the experience of this vision
Although Revelation 12 unveils the stronger part within the woman, it does not give us the way to become this stronger part
In chapter twelve we have seen a clear vision of a universal woman bearing a man-child and confronting a great dragon
Everyone on earth falls into one of two categories: those who are the people of God and those who are not the people of God
Among this part of His people there are also two main sections the firstfruit those who ripen early and the harvest those who ripen later
Chapter fourteen is a very significant chapter, revealing how the situation of everyone on earth will be dealt with
By His wisdom, righteousness, and sovereignty He will deal with everyone on earth in the proper way and at the proper time
The head signifies Babylon; the breast and arms, Medo-Persia; the belly and the thighs, Greece; and the two legs, the Roman Empire
It is a historical fact that the Roman Empire was divided into two sections signified by the legs of the image
In His wisdom God has used the image of the human body to give a clear picture of the various stages of the worldly powers
One hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way
In eternity our number will be twelve, three multiplied by four, signifying the mingling of the Triune God with man
Twelve times twelve means completion in God's administration for God's economy in completion in God's administration for God's economy
The New Jerusalem will declare to the whole universe that God's redeemed people will be twelve among twelve, completion among completions
When we are in the New Jerusalem, we will be the completion in God's administration for the fulfillment of God's economy for eternity
In chapter fourteen we have a thousand of twelve multiplied by twelve, a thousand times of completion in completion
The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit are believers who are for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
At the time of verses 1 through 5 the firstfruit are no longer on earth because they have been purchased 'from the earth'
Those who stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion are raptured to the heavens before Antichrist's persecution of religion
The one hundred forty-four thousand sing a new song before the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders
Apart from the firstfruit, no one is able to learn this song, because no one else has the necessary experience
Since the singing of the one hundred forty-four thousand will be noisy in that day, should not our singing be somewhat noisy today?
Sometimes as we are making a tumultuous noise in the spirit singing and praising the Lord sweet music comes forth from this tumultuous sound
In order to be a living overcomer we must be kept by the Lord's grace from every defilement and pollution and live on earth like virgins
It is absolutely not a matter of legality; it is a matter of our desire to preserve ourselves as virgins for the Lord
If you pray to the Lord in this manner and desire to live like a virgin, all the 'bugs' will be under your feet
You may be wondering about the difference between the overcomers in chapter twelve and the overcomers in chapter fourteen
The enemy, the Devil, in heaven must be cast down by the man-child, who will execute the Lord's judgment over him
Although we who are living on earth must also fight against the enemy, there is no need to fight him all the time
In type, the firstfruit were brought not to the farmer's home, but into God's house, the temple, for His satisfaction
The sisters desire to be with their husbands instead of going home to their parents because they love their husbands
To the outsiders, it will come as a surprise for you to be standing on Mount Zion, but it should not be a surprise to you
We are told that the man-child is 'caught-up,' but we are told that the firstfruit are standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb
In such a case we should exercise our wisdom to say nothing, so that no lies nor falsehood would come out of our mouth
Although you may have read Revelation 14 many times, perhaps you have never been impressed with the term eternal gospel in verse 6
The eternal gospel will not be preached by men on earth, but by an angel in mid-heaven at the close of this age
Although the word dispensation includes the concept of time, it specifically denotes the various ways God uses to deal with people
The command to worship God as the Creator is in contrast to the worship of Antichrist and his image mentioned in verse 9
Although Antichrist may do certain signs, he did not create the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters
After this judgment has been carried out the Lord will come in glory with His army of overcoming believers to defeat Antichrist and his army
Acts 10:42, 17:31, and 2 Timothy 4:1 reveal that the Lord has been appointed by God to judge both the living and the dead
The Lord will judge the living after the defeat of Antichrist and the false prophet and after He has set up His throne of glory
These are those who will pass through the great tribulation and who will be the object of Antichrist's persecution
During the great tribulation the God-fearing Jews and the Christ-believing Christians will be hungry, thirsty, naked, ill, and imprisoned
Christ's exercise of judgment upon the living unbelievers at the throne of His glory will be based upon the eternal gospel
The 'goats,' those who follow Antichrist to persecute God's people, will be put with Antichrist into the lake of fire
After the firstfruit is raptured, Antichrist will persecute the God-fearing Jews and the Christ-believing Christians
In this way the suffering Jews and the persecuted Christians will be helped to gain the necessary food, clothing, and visitations
The Lord knows the deeds of those who have helped His people, and when He comes to judge the living, He will consider them as 'sheep'
The sheep however will not have eternal life entering into them rather they will enter into eternal life into the realm of eternal life
When Antichrist breaks the covenant with Israel in the middle of the last week , he will destroy every religion
Religious Babylon will fall at the beginning of the great tribulation, whereas material Babylon will fall after the great tribulation
The wine of her fornication' indicates the spiritual fornication of the Roman Catholic Church which she 'has made all the nations drink of'
Not long after the time of Constantine the Great, the church degraded to such an extent that it not only became apostate, but also worldly
Although Antichrist will exalt himself above God, actually he will be used by God to destroy two religions-Judaism and Catholicism
Antichrist will do a good cleaning job for the Lord, purging the earth of religion and making it ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus
After the rapture of the firstfruit, a warning will be given against the worship of the beast and his image and against the mark
Those who worship the beast and his image and who receive the mark of his name will be eternally tormented and have no rest day and night
Verse 12 says, 'Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus'
The saints who will remain in the great tribulation will need endurance to suffer the persecution by Antichrist
The firstfruit, those who ripen earlier, will be taken to Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation
All the believers since that time who have received Him as the seed of life have become the crop of God on earth
Those who ripen first will be reaped as the firstfruit to God before the great tribulation, as indicated in verses 1 through 5
The majority will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped near the end of the tribulation
According to the type in the Old Testament, the firstfruit was reaped and brought into the temple of God for God's enjoyment
When the harvest, the majority of the crop, was reaped, it was taken into the barn, between the field and the farmhouse
By this we see that the firstfruit will be taken to God's house-to Mount Zion in the heavens-and that the harvest will be taken to the air
According to chapter fourteen, the rapture of the harvest will take place after Antichrist's persecution of religion
All the saints included in the rapture of the harvest must pass through the greater part of the great tribulation
It will probably include the greater part of western Europe and possibly a part of North Africa and eastern Asia
Surely Russia will not be under the rule of the Roman Empire; neither will Australasia, China, India, or the United States
According to biblical prophecy, Antichrist will have dominion over only the territories of Europe, Asia Minor, Palestine, and North Africa
One proof of this is in Revelation 18, which shows that Antichrist's capital, Rome, will be a center of capitalism
The record of that chapter, which even speaks of selling souls, or people, is a record not of communism, but of capitalism
Certainly they will not be killed by Antichrist, because the United States will not be in Antichrist's territory
Since the United States will be a place of safety and refuge, the Christians in this country will not become the quick overcomers
Armies from three sources of military power will gather at Armageddon, but the American forces may not be included
The knowledge of fulfilled prophecies and the report of current events will motivate them all to seek the Lord and to love Him intensely
Some Christians will be the firstfruit, the majority will be the harvest, and a small number will be the gleanings
In order to know the Bible, we must put various portions of the Word together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
Based upon the fact that in the Bible animals are used to symbolize nations, we may ask what nation is symbolized by an eagle
When we were on chapter eight, we saw that the third part of the earth will be damaged by a series of supernatural calamities
The first is that He has prepared the United States to be a great eagle, and the second is that He has sent His recovery to this country
The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God'
The sources of Russia and the East can already be identified, but the source from Europe and Asia Minor is not yet settled
Due to the vast oil wealth in the Middle East, this area has already become the crucial focus of international relations
In Acts 1 we are told that the Lord Jesus, who ascended from the Mount of Olives, will return in the same way that He ascended
When the Lord sees all the worldly armies gathered together at the war of Armageddon, that will be the time for Him to tread the winepress
In 46 there were no people standing on the glassy sea but the late overcomers will stand there after they have been raptured to the heavens
According to the Bible, God exercises His judgment over the rebellious earth, angels, and mankind first by means of water and then fire
The song of Moses praises God for His judgment negatively, and the song of the Lamb praises Him for Christ's redemption positively
For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been made manifest'
Although His works have not yet come, you know that they will come because you know the governing principles by which God does things
God promises His people that He will judge the evildoers, vindicate His way, and avenge the blood of His people
The late overcomers in Revelation 15 will be included among those who will live and reign with Christ a thousand years
They will be priests of God and of Christ and co-kings with Christ, reigning with Him over the nations in the coming kingdom
In Revelation 14 and 15 we see God's wisdom in dealing with various peoples and in caring for His people in different ways
Most of the believers who pass through the greater part of the great tribulation will be included in the harvest
The first woe is the fifth trumpet in chapter nine, and the second woe is the sixth trumpet, also in chapter nine
The scene in heaven is revealed before the seven seals, again before the seven trumpets, and again before the seven bowls
By this time many things have transpired: the sixth seal, the first six trumpets, and even a portion of the seventh trumpet
The fury of God mentioned in 15:1, 7 and 16:1 indicates that God is angry with His enemy, especially with Antichrist and his kingdom
Revelation 11:19 says, 'And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple'
In the first section of the book of Revelation, chapters one through eleven, the center of the revelation is the throne with the rainbow
At the end of the second section there is the New Jerusalem, which is God's building, God's expression, and God's testimony
The first eleven chapters consummate with a great earthquake, and the last eleven chapters consummate with the New Jerusalem
Because the last eleven chapters of Revelation are for Gods expression and His Christ the center of this section is Gods temple and Gods ark
As the issue of God's acts in chapters twelve through twenty-two, we see the eternal temple with the eternal ark
Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor'?
According to my opinion, the angels who are to pour out the seven bowls should be clothed in military uniforms
Immediately after the record of their praises, there is the unveiling of the scene in heaven before the outpouring of the seven bowls
The book of Revelation firstly shows that the center of Gods judgment is the throne and then that the center of Gods testimony is the temple
The central principle of the first eleven chapters of Revelation must be applied in our daily life in our public life and in our church life
Many 'scorpions' are still creeping in our family life and married life, and some 'frogs' are still plaguing the church life
God responds to the praising of the late overcomers, not just from the throne, but also from within the temple
God's answer is not merely for judgment, but even the more for His testimony and for His expression, His temple
Because the seven angels with the seven bowls are not merely for Gods judgment but especially for Gods testimony they come out of the temple
For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God still exercises limitations in His ultimate fury in judgment upon the earth
Eventually, the revelation in the Bible leads us from the throne of God's government to the temple of God's expression
Because the throne of God has been eternally established, existing from eternity to eternity , there is no need for it to be built
Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the river of water of life will flow from God's throne to supply the entire city
In His last fury God will mark the rebellious ones with a sore on their skin because they bear the mark of the beast
Verse 4 says, 'And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood'
Not everyone dwelling on earth will deserve to be given blood to drink, for not all of them have poured out the blood of the saints
The earth-dwellers who will be punished by the seven bowls are mainly those who reside in the territory of Antichrist
Verses 8 and 9 say, 'And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire
By means of the signs they perform, these spirits of demons will gather together the kings of the inhabited earth for war
If it were not for God's sovereignty, how could Israel, a country surrounded by hostile nations, be able to survive?
Although all the worldly forces will be prepared to damage the little nation of Israel, the United States will not be included
According to the context, this word is spoken by the Lord at the end of the great tribulation before the war at Armageddon
When the seventh bowl is poured out upon the air, a loud voice 'out of the temple from the throne' will say, 'It is done'
Immediately after this word is spoken, there will be lightnings, voices, thunders, and the greatest earthquake that the world has ever seen
Verse 19 also says, 'And Babylon the great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath'
The sketches of the two Babylons are recorded in 14:8 and 16:19, the details are given in chapters seventeen and eighteen
In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God
All Bible students agree that the beast here refers to both the Roman Empire and to Antichrist, the last Caesar of the revived Roman Empire
Now we must ask this question: According to the Bible and according to world history, who is the prostitute riding on the Roman Empire?
When many Catholics hear that the Roman Church is the great prostitute, they will be offended and not be able to believe it
Notice that verse 4 says that the woman has in her hand 'a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication'
Babylonianism entered into Buddhism, and Buddhism, a further development of Babylonianism, was assimilated into Catholicism
Christmas is a blasphemy to Christ, and no Christian with a pure conscience should have anything to do with it
Thousands who knew nothing of Christ were baptized and came into Christendom, bringing their pagan customs with them
Although some Christians in Orange County condemn us as heretical, they themselves still practice the pagan festival of Christmas
After the rapture of the firstfruit, the local churches will be used by the Lord to help all the remaining Christians
There is a vast difference inwardly: the prostitute is filled with abominations, uncleanness, and spiritual fornication
When Christians see the destruction of the great prostitute at the hands of Antichrist, they will be convinced about the church
In the United States some have stayed for a while in the Lord's recovery and have learned the practice of the church life
If they meant business with the Lord for the recovery of genuine oneness, they certainly would have fellowshipped with us
Neither the Catholic Church, the denominations, nor the divisive and confusing free groups can do any preparation of the Bride
In verse 5 we see the name of the great prostitute Mystery Babylon the Great The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth
The religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches
If it were not for this evil mixture, the pope, in his subtlety, would never allow the charismatic movement to go on in his church
Every denomination must be examined to see whether or not it still has something of the great prostitute in it
Some may feel that it is too severe to say that the denominations and free groups are the daughters of the great prostitute
Madame Guyon could still worship before a statue of Mary because she had been born into the 'garlic room' of the Roman Catholic Church
One reason for saying that the denominations and most free groups are daughters of the prostitute is the presence of idols among them
Those who are divisive do not care for the one Body, the one church; they are not concerned about one local church for one city
If you have seen the vision, you will not dare to have any particular name, that is, any name other than the name of Christ
When some hear that we are the church, they are unhappy and say, 'Why do you say that you are the church and that we are not the church'?
The day is coming when the overcomers will be raptured and Antichrist will abolish Judaism and destroy Catholicism
They will no longer attend the mass in the Catholic Church; neither will they still go to the denominations or free groups
In order to show the apostle John that the apostate church is in such a desolate place, the angel carried him there
These words are fulfilled in the fact that the apostate Roman Church rides on peoples and nations throughout the world
What the apostate church commits is not adultery, the sin of an unfaithful spouse, but fornication, the sin of a prostitute
The Catholic Church is intimately involved with worldly politics, and the kings of the earth commit fornication directly with her
The prostitute holds in her hand 'a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication'
The angel told the apostle John, 'And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth'
Revelation 17:8 says, 'The beast whom you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction'
The fact that the beast and the dragon are the same color indicates that Antichrist will be one with Satan in appearance
The city of Rome is built on seven mountains, signified by the seven heads of the beast on which the prostitute sits
Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book
The sixth one, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written; therefore, it is said of him that he 'is'
When he comes, he must remain a little while' and then will be slain and resuscitated with the spirit of the fifth, Nero, to be the eighth
Verse 11 says, 'And the beast who was, and is not, he also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into destruction'
They will fully submit themselves to Antichrist, who will be very intelligent, imposing, convincing, and subduing
To be called is to be saved, whereas to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life
Today the Vatican exercises power, authority, and influence over many nations, and ambassadors from other nations are sent to the Vatican
Eventually, this will stir up the ten kings to hate the prostitute, and together with Antichrist they will destroy her
Antichrist and the ten kings will do certain things according to God's mind to terminate the apostate church and to fulfill God's will
Although many of us have had the Bible in our hands for years, we have never seen the significance of these two verses
If you want your relatives and friends to come out of the Roman Catholic Church, you must approach them in a proper way
The next time you visit her, you may read chapter thirteen concerning the beast, Antichrist, and the time after that, chapter seventeen
The subtle, devilish Catholicism is rooted in the blood of its people, and it is not easy to turn them away from it
The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: the literal, ancient Babylon, the religious Babylon, and the material Babylon
The Old Testament, especially the book of Jeremiah, contains many curses and condemnations pronounced by God upon Babylon
At the time of the recovery in the Old Testament, Ezra brought these vessels back to Jerusalem and placed them in the rebuilt temple
Pember and Alexander Hislop's The Two Babylons say that, without exception, every pagan religion originated with Babylonianism
The first Catholic missionaries to go to China found the image of the Madonna and child already in the Buddhist temples
Although the same picture under different titles is found everywhere, its origin can be traced to Nimrod at Babel
In the eyes of God the Roman Catholic Church, which perpetuates much of Judaism and has assimilated much from paganism, is Babylon
In Revelation 17 and 18 two aspects of Babylon, the religious aspect and the material aspect, are mixed together
In reading the prophecies regarding the coming of Christ, we must know which refer to His first coming and which refer to His second coming
In Genesis 22:11-12, Exodus 3:2-6, Judges 6:11-24, and Zechariah 1:11-12; 2:3, 8-11, and 3:1-7, we read of the angel of the Lord
As we study the context of all these references to the angel of the Lord, we see that the angel of the Lord is actually the Lord Himself
In the book of Revelation Christ is revealed at least three or four times as an angel sent by God to fulfill God's commission
Refers to the religious aspect whereas the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury refers to the material aspect
It is the Roman religion, not the Roman Empire, that has made all nations drunk with her religious, devilish wine
It is the city of Rome, not the Roman Church, that has enriched the merchants of the earth by the power of her luxury
Since Babylon the Great is twofold, to come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon
She has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird'
The day is coming when no one will go there because it will be filled with demons, unclean spirits, and unclean and hateful birds
These devilish things have been in power for at least two thousand years and have damaged and poisoned mankind throughout the earth
As a result of the condemnation and curse pronounced upon ancient Babylon, it became unfit for human habitation
The international merchants who have made great profit from this wealthy city will weep when they see it under God's judgment
Many are selling their soul, their life, themselves, to their occupation, neglecting God and their eternal destiny
Verse 20 says, 'Rejoice over her, O heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because God has judged your judgment upon her'
Perhaps the destruction of Babylon will be accomplished by a great earthquake that will cause the entire city to sink into the sea
In verses 1 through 3 we have a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, praising God and saying, 'Hallelujah'!
When the time comes for the fall of Babylon, the religious aspect will be destroyed first and the material aspect later
After the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven says Hallelujah the twentyfour elders and the four living creatures say Amen Hallelujah!
The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures say 'Amen' to these hallelujahs and then add more hallelujahs of their own
325 at a council convened under the authority of the Emperor Constantine, is widely accepted throughout Catholicism and Protestantism
Although the book of Revelation is printed in the Bible, in the experience of many, this book has actually been taken away from them
Because most of these writings do not follow a sound principle in expounding this book, most of what they say is not accurate
We must know the origination of the symbol in the Old Testament and then trace the development of it in the New Testament
If we would know the significance of the lampstand in Revelation, then we must consult Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4
Another illustration of the proper way to understand Revelation is the matter of the beast in chapter thirteen
If we study the first mention of any symbol and then trace its development, we shall have the right interpretation of it
All the interpretations the Lord has given us are according to these principles and are fully supported by history
We have seen that Antichrist will be a double character; he will be both the seventh Caesar and the eighth Caesar
In the book of Revelation, also written by the apostle John, we see that Christ our Redeemer is the Lamb and the coming Bridegroom
He is even active in the preaching of the gospel and even attempts to inject himself into the work of the building up of the church
The principle is the same in the Lord's recovery today, for Satan is still devising a counterfeit of what God is doing
Shocked by this answer, the brothers immediately asked him by what standard these groups were relatively right
We would all agree that in the past three hundred years Madame Guyon was probably the one who had the greatest measure of Christ
Eventually, the One within, who is much stronger than we are, captured us, and we had to come to the right place
The Lord hates the prostitute, and before He enjoys a pleasant wedding with His Bride, He will utterly get rid of the prostitute
No bridegroom would want some kind of triangular relationship, and the Lord as the Bridegroom surely would not tolerate such a thing
According to Matthew 25:1-13, the five wise virgins will be admitted to the wedding feast, and the five foolish ones will be rejected
As the Lord is coming down from heaven to earth, He will linger for a time in the air, where He will take care of certain matters
Verse 6 describes the voice of the great multitude 'as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders'
The praise as the sound of many waters proceeds continually, and as the sound of mighty thunders it displays solemnity
According to the revelation of the whole Bible, we, the saved ones, need two garments-one for our salvation and one for our reward
According to the custom of the ancient Jews, no one could attend a wedding feast without a special wedding garment
If you would be qualified to attend the wedding feast of Christ, you need to live by Christ and to live Him out in your daily living
Although we have the first garment, our second garment is now being prepared under the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ the Bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
The Bridegroom, who will take the whole earth as His kingdom, certainly needs many sub-kings to be His co-kings
After being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity
To be invited to the wedding feast of Christ which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium is to be blessed
Matthew 2214 says For many are called but few are chosen and Revelation 1714 says They who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful
Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we shall be chosen
Although the church today should be the testimony of Jesus, some among us are below the standard of the testimony of Jesus
After the Lord has gained His Bride, He will be able to boast to Satan and to the whole universe, saying, 'This Bride is My testimony'
Under the instigation of Antichrist, man will even wage war directly against the Lord of lords and the King of kings
Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire, and Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss
At that time Christ will be happy, and we, His Bride, shall also be happy as we enjoy a wonderful honeymoon with our Bridegroom
In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus says, 'Go from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels'
Because the 'goats' followed the Devil, they will be cast into the lake of fire prepared for him and his angels
Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies will be swept into the 'dust pan' and then dumped into the lake of fire
After the judgment at the great white throne, all the dead unbelievers will also be cast into the lake of fire
The Lord's fighting in the war at Armageddon will actually be a sweeping of dirt into the universal 'trash can'
In order for the Lord to enjoy a pleasant honeymoon and the thousand-year kingdom, all the trash must be swept away
There will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and to judge these rebels in righteousness
Because we have experienced Him as light, life, manna, power, strength, holiness, and comfort, we know Him in all these aspects
No matter how much we have experienced Christ, there is still something about Him unknown to us because we have not experienced it
He will declare that God is the God over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority
It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him
In the Gospel of John the Word of God does not speak anything related to fighting; rather, He speaks redemption, light, life, and building
The sword, which proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the Word of God, is the word which will judge the rebellious
When the Lord says Antichrist go to the lake of fire we all shall say Amen and Antichrist will immediately be cast into the lake of fire
Christ will firstly smite the nations with His judging word; then He will shepherd those who remain with His strong power
Because the nations will still have the rebellious human nature, the Lord will shepherd them during the millennium with an iron rod
All the grapes, the Gentile military forces, will be gathered into the winepress and will be trodden by the Lord Jesus
Verse 14 says, 'And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and pure'
In the previous message we saw that the overcoming saints have two garments, the one for salvation and the other for reward
After World War II, the nation of Israel was formed again in 1948, and people's attention began to focus on the Middle East
Sooner or later something will take place there; for both in Europe and in the Middle East people are seeking a strong leader
Presently, the site of the temple is occupied by a Moslem mosque, their second most important religious shrine
Even the problem over oil may be used by the Lord for the fulfillment of prophecy related to the war of Armageddon
Because so many Israelites are still in unbelief, before the Lord comes back Jerusalem will be like Sodom in the eyes of God
Between the rapture of the overcomers and the beginning of the millennial kingdom, many things will take place
However, the kingdom will not come at that time, for the three and a half years of the great tribulation are yet to come
The Lord Jesus will cast Antichrist and the false prophet directly into the lake of fire because He has no further use for them
After the war at Armageddon, the Lord will establish His throne of glory in Jerusalem and gather before Him all the nations still on earth
The 'goats' will go to the fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, and the 'sheep' will enter into the millennial kingdom as citizens
They will still have a rebellious nature within them, and thus they will need a further test a thousand years later
Because the Lord will use Satan to test them, He will not cast Satan into the lake of fire at the beginning of the millennium
Acts 321 refers to the times of restoration of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
Today the sun and the moon are not normal because they have been cursed through the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man
According to the prophecies in Deuteronomy, this land has been cursed because of the sinfulness of the children of Israel
At the time of restoration, not only mankind but also all of creation will be restored to its original condition
Isaiah 11:8 says, 'And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the viper's den'
According to the prophecies of the Bible the millennial kingdom is in two sections the upper heavenly section and the lower earthly section
The upper section of the millennium is called the kingdom of the Father , and the lower section is called the kingdom of the Son of Man
The first are the overcoming saints, including the overcoming saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament
The second group, found in the lower section, is the preserved and proper Jews, who will be saved at the time of the Lord's coming back
According to Zechariah 12:10-14, these Jews will look on Him whom they have pierced, and then they will repent
These saved Jews will enter into the millennium as priests and will teach the nations to seek God and to know Him
Isaiah 61:6 clearly says, 'But ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God'
The kingly overcomers will be in the upper part of the millennium, and the priestly Jews and the citizens will be in the lower part
If you understand them, then as you read the Bible, you will know which verses refer to the upper part and which verses to the lower part
Undoubtedly, Peter, Paul, James, Stephen, and the many others slain throughout the centuries will be included in this number
These saints, martyred for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, will be resurrected to be co-kings of Christ
If those in the man-child will be among the co-kings, then certainly those making up the firstfruit will be also
The first resurrection is also the ex-resurrection, that is, the extraordinary resurrection which the apostle Paul sought for
It is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection, the resurrection with honor, comparable to graduation with honors
Certainly, they will not be resurrected with the man-child, for they will be martyred during the great tribulation
We should not be content merely to be in the general resurrection of the believers; rather, we should aspire to be in the best resurrection
Concerning those who participate in the first resurrection, verse 6 says, 'Over these the second death has no authority'
Some may say, 'The believers will be resurrected before the millennium and will never be put into the lake of fire, the second death'
If there is no possibility that we might still have a problem, why then will we be judged after the resurrection?
In 1 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, 'If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire'
Although you may criticize others today, as you stand before the judgment seat, you will have to criticize yourself
That punishment will be something related to the second death just as weakness sickness trouble and hardship are related to the first death
Today God uses weakness, sickness, trouble, and hardship to discipline us and to chastise us that we may grow in life
If you leave school before you graduate and return some time later, you will still have to complete your schoolwork
If you die in your immaturity, after your resurrection you will stand in immaturity before the Lord's judgment seat
Only the over-comers, those who participate in the best resurrection, will not be subject to anything of the second death
Although you are saved for eternity, you still need to grow, to mature, and to be perfected so that you may be among the co-kings of Christ
If this is your condition, what will you say to the Lord when you stand before the judgment seat of Christ after your resurrection?
He will tell you that you need to suffer something in order to mature, that you need something of the second death to work on you
Praise the Lord for the overcomers who participate in the best resurrection and over whom the second death has no authority!
Verse 6 also says that the overcomers 'shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years'
The overcomers will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium
Today the proper Christians bring man and man's need to God and Christ, and they also minister God and Christ to man
Although the condition of everything in the millennial kingdom will be wonderful, within mankind there will still be a rebellious nature
The judgment at the white throne will deal with the dead unbelievers, with death and Hades that hold the dead, and with the demons
In this portion of the Word we see the final clearance in the universe as a preparation for the coming of the new heaven and the new earth
Before the millennium, many things will be dealt with: the great prostitute, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the evil, worldly forces
The immaturity of God's people is truly a shame to Him, and during the millennium God will rid His people of this shame
Some Christian teachers have said that when the millennium comes, everything in God's economy will have been completed and perfected
In the last dispensation God will even use the items related to the second death to discipline and to punish the immature believers
In this present dispensation He will also deal with Catholicism, Judaism, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the evil, worldly forces
During the millennium God will discipline the immature believers to rid them of their shame and to bring them into maturity
After the thousand years, Satan will be released and used by the Lord to test rebellious mankind and to purge out man's rebellious nature
As we have seen, after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison and used by God to test mankind
The nations will go up 'over the breadth of the earth' and surround 'the camp of the saints and the beloved city'
It will be exposed by Satan's last instigation and it will be purged away by the Lord's final judgment on mankind
Ezekiel 38:2 indicates that Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, answering to Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk
Revelation 20:8 shows that Satan's deceiving of the nations which are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of Gog and Magog
Because man's rebellious nature is so deeply rooted in his being, it will still be present even after the thousand years
According to my study of biblical prophecy, the earth today does have a part, the third part, that is very dark
The communist countries have a way to stir up people, and they will gather their people together for this last war
The camp of the saints is the lodging of the overcoming believers, who are the heavenly armies camping on earth
We, the heavenly armies, will be there camping, and the nations under the influence of Gog and Magog will attack us
The overcoming believers and the remnant of Israel will be God's faithful people on earth in the millennium, standing with God and for God
At the end of the millennium, Satan will instigate rebellious mankind from the uttermost parts of the north to attack them
The beast, the false prophet, and the 'goats' in Matthew 25 will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than the Devil
After the millennium, the rebellious nature of mankind will be thoroughly purged, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire
God the Father 'has given all judgment to the Son' and has ordained Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead
Verse 11 says that earth and heaven will flee away from the face of the One on the throne and that no place will be found for them
These scrolls are the record of the works, the deeds, of the unbelievers, according to which they will be judged
You may be shocked to hear that not only human beings but also demons will be judged at the great white throne
In message two in our life-study of Genesis we pointed out that in the pre-Adamic age there were some living beings with spirits
The lake of fire is the 'trash can' for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades, will be cast
Since the unbelievers have followed the Devil they share the Devils judgment and will become jointpartakers of the Devils eternal torment
Because God's dispensations are not completed until chapter twenty-one, the new heaven and the new earth do not appear before that time
According to the Bible, there are not seven dispensations from Adam to the end of the millennium; there are four
The third dispensation from Christs first coming until the restoration of all things at Christs second coming is the dispensation of grace
In the first three dispensations, God perfects the patriarchs, some Old Testament saints, and some New Testament believers
God has postponed the perfecting of the children of Israel until the fourth dispensation, at which time it will be fully accomplished
One function of the dispensation of the kingdom is to complete the perfection of the children of Israel and of the immature Christians
God will use many things to perfect His people: Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, weakness, hardship, and various other difficulties
Now that My people have been perfected, all these things may be put into the universal 'trash can,' the lake of fire'
When God's people have been thoroughly perfected, He will have no further use for the old heaven and the old earth
According to Hebrews 111 and 12 the earth and the heavens will become old as a garment and the Lord shall roll them up and put them away
Take, for example, the appearing of the resurrected Christ to His disciples on the evening of His resurrection
Just as we cannot explain this, neither can we explain the various matters related to the passing away of the old heaven and the old earth
Under God's enlightenment, we have seen that unless we are perfected in life, God does not have a way to accomplish His eternal purpose
According to the clear vision in the whole Bible we not only need redemption forgiveness and regeneration we also urgently need perfection
If we are not completed perfected and matured in this dispensation we shall be dealt with in the next dispensation so that we might mature
In other Christian groups, if you are not happy with those around you, you can easily leave them and go elsewhere
When the worldly people are unhappy with their marriage, they simply seek a divorce and run away from their problems
After we have entered into the marriage of the church life, we must stay in the oven until we have been completely baked
The day is coming when we shall no longer need the oven, for we shall be perfected, and everything will be new
The work of God's re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the waters which were the result of this judgment
The living creatures of the pre-Adamic world, after being judged by the waters, became the inhabitants of the sea
From the time of God's work of re-creation, God has intended to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons
Peter 3:13 says, 'But according to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells'
In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears
Since death will be wholly swallowed up by life and cast into the lake of fire , in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more death
Death will be thrown into the 'trash can,' the lake of fire, and the elements of death-sorrow, crying, and pain-will be abolished
The sons of God will participate in all the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem, especially the enjoyment of the water of life
Chapter one not only tells us that John was in spirit; it also reveals that he was on the island called Patmos
By being on the island of Patmos and by being in spirit, John could see the churches, the seven golden lampstands
Although many read and study the book of Revelation and have even read our messages on the seven lampstands, they do not see anything
Immediately before John saw the seven golden lampstands, he heard a loud voice and he turned to see the voice that spoke with him
When we have the proper position with the right angle and the ability to see, we are able to see the vision of the seven golden lampstands
Because he was in the proper position and because he was in spirit, he saw the seven golden lampstands as soon as he turned to see the voice
Although we may not understand all these things or be able to explain them to others, we shall certainly see them for ourselves
His book of Revelation is not a lecture, a sermon, or even a message; it is a description and a declaration of what he saw
We need to be uplifted to a high mountain that we may see God's dwelling place for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
The New Jerusalem is vastly higher than the churches, and in order to see it, John had to be carried to a high mountain
If the servants lived in a mansion and the children lived in a poor cottage, would you prefer to live in the mansion or in the cottage?
Although the appearance of the church is not marvelous or splendid, the children of God are there, and God enjoys being with them
Eventually, the poor 'cottage' of the church will be transformed into the New Jerusalem, which will be far more splendid than any mansion
Twelve thousand stadia is approximately one thousand three hundred and sixty miles, the distance from San Diego to Seattle
The Bride in the kingdom age will include the overcomers , but the wife in eternity will include all God's redeemed ones
If his home is very neat, clean, and orderly, then you know that the person who dwells there is that kind of person
Restored mankind, the nations, will live around the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God, and they will enjoy God there
In the Bible, there are just two paradises, the paradise mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Luke 23:43 and the New Jerusalem
According to the Lord's word in Luke 16, there are two sections in Hades, and between these sections there is a great chasm
Scofield, believe that at the time of Christ's resurrection the pleasant section of Hades was transferred to the third heaven
If you read this portion of the Word carefully according to the Greek text, you will see that it proves the opposite
The teaching that the Old Testament saints in paradise were transferred to heaven on the day of Christ's resurrection is not accurate
On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Lord's resurrection, Peter said, 'David is not ascended into the heavens'
In principle, for a soul to be disembodied means that it is naked, and no naked person can come into God's presence
The paradise of the New Jerusalem, which is eternal, will be vastly superior to the paradise in Hades, which is merely a temporary lodging
Many have understood these chapters in a very natural way and have considered them a description of a material city
Throughout the centuries, what Christians have spoken about the church has come out of their mistaken concept of what the church is
Suppose a thousand regenerated Christians meet together; yet they quarrel, fight, criticize one another, and live in the flesh
In the book of Revelation, the ultimate conclusion of the Bible, many signs are used to convey spiritual realities
When we say that the church is a golden lampstand, we do not mean that the church is actually a stand with seven lamps
In the Old Testament we see that God's people were considered material to be built together as His dwelling place
In the garden in Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and near the tree of life there is a river flowing in four directions
The first mention of stone in the Bible is not of ordinary, common stone, but of onyx, a type of precious stone
In the breastplate of the high priest were set twelve precious stones , the first of which was sardius and the last, jasper
The precious stones of both the breastplate and the shoulder plates bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel
Upon the breastplate of the high priest were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel engraved upon twelve stones
These letters were carved upon the thummim, and when this stone was put into the breastplate, there was completion and perfection
The high priest took down all the letters from the various stones as they shone, and in so doing he formed words and sentences
According to the record of Genesis 28 Jacob a supplanter had a divine dream in which he saw a ladder set up on earth and reaching to heaven
He took the stone he had used for a pillow, set it up as a pillar, anointed it with oil, and called it the house of God
The stone in Zechariah is neither the foundation stone nor the cornerstone; it is the topstone with seven eyes
The concept that the believers are stones to be built up for God's habitation is not new in the book of Revelation
The entire city of New Jerusalem is God's building, the living composition of all God's redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints
All the Old Testament prophets, including Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, and the minor prophets, were preachers
The twelve tribes of Israel are the gates through which the riches of the New Jerusalem are supplied to mankind
We should never say that we came in through a gate that bears a British name, a German name, or any Gentile name
Verse 14 says, 'And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
The jasper wall signifies that the whole city, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God
When we are in New Jerusalem, we shall marvel to see that the whole city has the same appearance, the appearance of jasper
Today's Christianity, however, is much different, for there everyone has his own color and his own opinion and speaks his own mind
Verse 21 says, 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl'
In this message we shall consider some further characteristics of New Jerusalem, namely its measurements and its wall
According to 11:1, 'a reed like a rod' was used to 'measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it'
There is no implication of judgment, discipline, or chastisement, for in every respect New Jerusalem is complete and perfect
When the four dispensations are over and the new heaven and new earth have come, there will be no further need for measuring with a rod
The New Jerusalem, which will be measured by a golden reed, will be fully possessed by the Lord in a very positive way
The whole city with its gates and wall can pass the measuring and testing of the nature of God hence it is qualified to be possessed by God
The church must be substantially divine; that is, the divine substance must be wrought into the very being of the church life
When we are about to express our love for one another, we must determine what kind of love is being expressed, whether it is human or divine
He measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal'
The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, are equal in length, breadth, and height
That the length, breadth, and height of New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies
In the Life-study of Hebrews we pointed out that our experience of the Holy of Holies must be constantly increasing
Eventually, our Holy of Holies will be more than one thousand three hundred sixty miles in length, width, and height
The book of Hebrews reveals that through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Holy of Holies is open to all those who believe in Him
All the redeemed ones may enter into the presence of God, live there, and remain there, enjoying fellowship in oneness with God
Everyone in it will see God, touch God, worship God, serve God, and even live and dwell in the presence of God
Verse 17 says, 'And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
Twelve times twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions
a measure of a man, that is, of an angel' signifies that the wall of the city is not natural, but in resurrection
While jasper indicates God as the God of glory in His rich life, sardius signifies God as the God of redemption
We have seen that the wall is a hundred and forty-four cubits high, and that this measure is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel
The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed and that the divine life rises up in its place
Of a 'honey' love, we need a love that is in resurrection, a love that has been killed by the cross and resurrected with the divine life
Using another's Bible does not indicate that you love him in the spirit; rather, it proves that you love him according to your natural taste
If you do this you will be kept from the natural life and you will love others in resurrection according to humanity but in angelic likeness
There was a certain sister who always helped others, but who did not have enough money to buy a good Bible for herself
Through receiving this gift of a Bible, her faith was confirmed, and she grew in the matter of believing the Lord
Although perhaps millions of jasper stones have been fit together to form the wall, every side of the wall has the same expression
They are the same in substance, in color, in appearance, in brightness, and in glory because they have been transformed by the same life
Do you think that, after we all have the substance, color, and appearance of jasper, we shall still debate or hold differing opinions?
The more the divine nature fills us from within, the more our concepts and opinions are spontaneously laid aside
When we are both filled with the divine nature and swallowed up by it, our concepts will be changed, and we shall all be of the same jasper
We must drop all our different expressions that we may be built into the same wall and may all have the unique expression of God
Genuine building is to be swallowed up by the divine nature and occupied, filled, saturated, and permeated with the divine nature
What is needed is to have our disposition, whether it be American, Chinese, British, or German, swallowed up and replaced by the divine gold
If you are filled with the divine gold, your heart will be larger than Solomon's , because it will be as big as God's heart
When we all have the same expression, we have the appearance of God, symbolized in the book of Revelation by jasper
Some are captured by the distractions of the world because they do not express God in the appearance of jasper
When we lose the divine expression and express something of ourselves in its place our separation disappears and we are no longer protected
Hebrews 11:10, speaking of Abraham, says, 'For he waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God'
From the time the Lord's recovery was raised up among us more than fifty years ago, this testimony has been more and more solidly founded
Many of the free groups that began in this country some years ago are no longer in existence because they did not have a solid foundation
Because we have such a solid foundation, the more we are opposed and attacked, the more solidly founded we become
Verse 14 says, 'And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
Since in eternity there will be no further need of the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles
The twelve apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God
When Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Cephas, which means 'a stone'
All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building
Since jasper signifies God expressed in His communicable glory, the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory
Today's Christian workers not only have different colors; instead of being one on top of another, they are side by side
The work of the apostles, on the contrary, was layer upon layer and led to the unique appearance of jasper, the appearance of God in Christ
In the entire universe there will only be the unique New Jerusalem built upon the foundation of many ministries laid one on top of the other
Although there will be different ministries, they will be layer upon layer, and they will lead to the one appearance of God in Christ
All the ministries must lead to one appearance-the appearance of today's church and of the coming New Jerusalem
The testimony of one group, for example, may be the washing of feet and the testimony of another group, the speaking in tongues
We are not building side by side; we are building one on top of another to bring forth the unique testimony of God in the universe
Because the foundation is built upon the very faithfulness with which God keeps His covenant, it is trustworthy and reliable
Because these ministries have no gates and no streets, there is no way to actually enter into what they have to offer
Brother Nee's book, The Normal Christian Life, on the contrary, shows us the gates and a definite way to practice what this book describes
During the more than eighteen years since my visit with this brother in England, the Lord has vindicated the practicality of the church
Revelation 2113 reveals that in New Jerusalem there are three gates on the east three on the north three on the south and three on the west
The three gates on each side signify that the Triune God- Father, Son, and Spirit-work together to bring people into the holy city
The fact that the Triune God is working to bring people into the holy city is also implied in the Lord's word in Matthew 28:19
The three gates are not on three sides respectively; rather, there are three gates on each of the four sides repeatedly
The three in the Godhead the Father the Son and the Spirit have come out in Gods economy to reach us and to bring us back to His economy
If God were not triune, He would not be able to dispense Himself into us, to work Himself into us, and to mingle Himself with us
Three gates on each of the four sides, constituting the number twelve, also imply the mingling of the Triune God with man, God's creature
Three times four indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with His creature, man, to produce a composition, a compound
Verse 21 says, 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl'
When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl
Through our experience of the death and resurrection of Christ, we have passed through the pearl gates and are now within the city
Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of New Jerusalem
The law watches and observes to insure that all the communications the comings in and the goings out of the holy city meet its requirements
Even our repentance was according to the law for we repented because we had violated the law and we confessed our sins according to the law
Our entrance into the holy city did not break the law; rather, it was according to the law and even a fulfillment of the law
Twelve gates indicate that the communication in the New Jerusalem is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God's administration
The angels will be the gatekeepers of our possession, while we shall be the ones enjoying the rich inheritance in God's eternal economy
Following the entrance of regeneration, the daily life and walk of the saints must be in the way of the divine nature
After you have entered in through the gates by grace, you will begin to walk, and you will need to walk a long way
In the New Jerusalem there is no such thing as a Baptist street, a Presbyterian street, a Methodist street, or a Lutheran street
Although the pearls may be opaque, every one of them is a great open gate, which will not be shut by day or by night
As 22:2 says, 'And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month'
The more we walk, act, and have our being according to the divine nature, the more of the life supply we shall receive
If you do not care for the divine nature within you, but do things according to your taste, you will immediately lose the supply of life
The three equal dimensions of the city indicate that the whole city will be the Holy of Holies, the inner temple
The Greek word for temple in verse 22 naos does not denote the whole temple in a common way including the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place
The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and man for eternity
Because the whole city is the Holy of Holies and because the inner temple is God and the Lamb, the city is God and the Lamb
As we have pointed out elsewhere, the whole city of New Jerusalem is also a living composition of all God's redeemed ones
On the one hand, the church is a composition of all the believers; on the other hand, Christ is both the Head and the Body
Although we repudiate this slanderous accusation, we do say that we are the expansion of God and the enlargement of God
It is similar to the temple, which was firstly God's dwelling place and then the place where the priests served God
The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
Since such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it has no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man
Outside the city there will be night, but within the city there will be no night because we shall have an eternal divine light, God Himself
In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold
The nations will not need to walk in the sunlight or in the moonlight, for they will walk in the shining of New Jerusalem
The church should be such a shining light today, and all our neighbors should walk in the light of our shining
With the church people, there should be a difference, a difference not of some man-made designation, but a difference because of our shining
Eventually, we shall be glorified with Christ to bear the glory of God for God's expression in the New Jerusalem
Today the believers as children of light are the light of the world , shining in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation
Eventually New Jerusalem as a composition of all the saints will be the lightbearer shining forth God as light over the nations around her
It does not have light in itself, but the light, which is God, has been wrought into it and shines out through it
The light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper stone, bearing the appearance of God to express God by her shining
The light is God, its glory is the expression of God, and its appearance is God Himself revealed to the nations
The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of our redeeming God, the throne of God and of the Lamb
Our God is not only the God on the throne for His administration, nor only the God in the temple for His expression
In eternity future God's throne will be in the center of New Jerusalem, and His expression will extend to the circumference
God and the Lamb are not sitting side by side; rather, the very God is within the Lamb as the lamp and shines out through Him
Although we do not have the proper words, we do have a picture of God as light and of Christ, the Lamb, as the lamp
Baptism is the real entrance into the Triune God , and the entrance into the Triune God is the initial entrance into New Jerusalem
Immediately after we pass through the pearl gates, we find ourselves on the golden street that leads us upward to the throne of God
It is by His administration that God dispenses Himself into us as life as the life supply and as the eternal absolute allinclusive grace
The divine authority in the church is for God to dispense Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the all-sufficient grace
The throne of God and of the Lamb in the center of New Jerusalem symbolizes the divine authority of God's headship in Christ
The life supply flows out of this authority, and the enjoyment of the life supply brings us under this authority
In the flow of the water of life there are the life supply and the divine authority with the fellowship in life
The river, as typified by the rivers in Genesis 2:10-14, Psalm 46:4, and Ezekiel 47:5-9, signifies the abundance of life in its flow
It is one river, flowing through the four directions of the holy city like the four heads of the one river in Genesis 2:10-14
The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply
Genesis 2:10 says, 'And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads'
The dispensing of the life supply and of God's all-sufficient grace issues out of the throne of God's administration
If you do this, you will immediately enjoy the inner flow, and this flow will make you crystal clear in the divine life
Many young people are very concerned about the matter of marriage and want to know the Lord's will regarding this matter
The elders may give them a number of principles regarding age, education, race, family background, disposition, and spirituality
The more we analyzed merely according to age, education, race, disposition, and spirituality, the more veiled we were
Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, for eternity, all God's redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion
Suppose when the inward regulation tells this sister not to buy that particular article, she says, 'Amen, Lord, amen'
It is difficult to understand the golden street, the water of life, and the tree of life if we approach them in a doctrinal way
As soon as we submit to this headship, the life-giving Spirit immediately flows within us, and we find ourselves on the golden street
As we walk along the golden street we find that the inward flowing of the lifegiving Spirit is marvelous refreshing satisfying and supplying
Along this flow of the living water there are the riches of the tree of life that grows by the flow of the river
Remember the significance of the number twelve: it is completion in God's administration for His economy eternally
The mention of 'each month' indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months
As for time, in the new heaven and new earth, there are twelve months yearly, twelve hours daily, and twelve hours nightly
God redeemed us to enjoy the tree of life, and this enjoyment is for God's administration of His eternal economy
At the end of this age a great part of the inhabitants of the earth will be killed during the time of the sixth and seventh trumpets
The rest will be transferred to the new earth as the nations, living around the New Jerusalem and walking by its light
The redeemed and regenerated saints will be kings over these kings , and Christ will be the King of kings for eternity
The glory of the nations will be their choice produce and their honor will be their preciousness in condition and their dignity in position
He is the unique source of everything to produce, support, sustain, and keep the unique building of the one God
We have nothing other than the unique God on the unique throne with the unique flow with the unique life supply
We are one in God, one in His authority, one in His expression, one in the flow, one in the life, and one in the tree
Although people hunger and thirst for a proper communal life, they are poisoned by the clubs and parties of the world
There is only one kind of party that is pure, happy, nourishing, enlightening, satisfying, and edifying, and that is the church
Young people are sharp and quite demanding, and they can pierce into the hearts of their parents or of the elders in the church
We can testify that there is no comparison between the enjoyment of God in the church and the enjoyment of God apart from the church
In this wonderful mingled life, we daily enjoy God in all the dear saints, and we enjoy the dear saints in God
It is difficult to determine whether the throne of God in Revelation 21 and 22 is the throne of authority or the throne of grace
In Hebrews 4 the throne is the throne of grace, but in Revelation 4 the throne is mainly the throne of authority
Proceeding out of the throne is not authority, but the river of water of life, with the tree of life as the life supply
Although the throne is the throne of authority, the throne of headship, out of the throne flows the river of water of life
He is reigning in the church, among the churches, and over all the churches through the flowing of His life as grace
If anyone in the church in Anaheim still gossips, this means that the church is still under a small, subtle curse
For there to be no more curse means that there is no longer any gossip, hatred, criticism, weakness, or deadness
Because in the new heaven and the new earth there will no longer be the problem of sin, there will be no need for any redeeming work
The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, who sent His angel to show the things in this book, is the Lord Jesus
Do not think that because the Lord has been tolerating the situation for more than nineteen centuries, He is slow to come back
There He said, 'Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep what is written in it'
For centuries, however, this book was closed and, along with the rest of the Bible, kept away from the people by the Roman Catholic Church
Having read through all the messages of this life-study, we can no longer say that the book of Revelation is closed to us
Rather, you must keep the book open by plunging into every aspect of this prophecy and by diving into the flow
Anyone who hardens himself and who does not keep this book open to himself or himself open to this book will remain in his pitiful condition
If you are righteous and holy and keep yourself open to this book and this book open to you, you will continue to be righteous and holy
At the Lord's coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ
If we look away from all things unto Him, we shall enjoy Him as our Alpha, as our Omega, and as our everything
According to verse 13, the Lord Jesus is not only the First, but also the beginning, not only the Last, but also the end
We must exercise our faith in this all-inclusive One, the One who is the Alpha, the Omega, the First, the Last, the beginning, and the end
In His divinity, Christ is the Root of David, his source; in His humanity, He is the Offspring of David, his issue
At His coming back, Christ will be the Sun to His people generally , but the morning star to His watching lovers particularly
Come' is the response of the Spirit and the Bride to the Lord's word in verse 16 and His repeated warning in verses 7 and 12
In chapters two and three the Spirit is the speaker, and the churches were the receivers of the speaking of the Spirit
The church is no longer merely the receiver of the divine oracle; she has also become one with the divine Speaker
When we have a sincere desire for the Lord's coming, we also have an earnest concern for the sinners' salvation
Verse 17 strongly implies that if we have a desire for the Lord's coming back, we shall be very concerned for others' salvation
The 'I' in verse 18 should be the Lord Jesus, according to verses 16 and 20, or it could refer to John, according to 1:2
The outstanding features of the blessing revealed in the book of Revelation are the tree of life and the holy city
Whether one will suffer the plagues or share in the blessing depends upon how he deals with the prophecy of this book
Do not add your concept, your thought, your idea, your opinion, your doctrine, your teaching, or your theology to this book
After this concluding prayer, the writer gives the readers a blessing, saying, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints
Although man was created in the image of God, at the time of creation, man did not have the life of God in him
Consider how many changes there have been and will be from the time of Adam until the time of the New Jerusalem
The reason you have experienced so many changes is that you have not yet been brought into God's unchanging building
In the book of Genesis there are eight important men: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
The lampstand was a very crucial item in the tabernacle because it directed people to the ark in the Holy of Holies
The lampstand directed people into the Holy of Holies; it pointed the way to the law of life in the ark of testimony
If we had only the book of Exodus, we would not be able to understand the significance of the lampstand and its seven lamps
In Zechariah 3 and 4 the lampstand with its lamps appears again as a development of the lampstand in Exodus 25
When we put Zechariah 4:10 with Zechariah 4:2, we see that the seven lamps of the lampstand are also the seven eyes of the Lord
In Zechariah the seven lamps are developed into seven eyes, and the lampstand is developed into the stone and into Jehovah, the Lord
We have not only the seven lamps, but also the seven eyes; not only the lampstand, but also the stone, Jehovah
Peter was telling the religionists that they rejected not only their Redeemer, but also the cornerstone of God's building
On the one hand, there is a line containing six items: the lampstand, the stone, Jehovah, the Lamb, the throne of God, and God
On the other hand, there is another line with three items: the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits
Today, God is administering His government by means of enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning
Any fleshly work, work done in the name of the Lord but actually having nothing to do with Him, will be burned
We may be able to hide things from one another, but when the seven lamps shine on us, we are utterly naked and exposed
The lamps are for enlightening and burning; the eyes are both for watching and observing and also for infusing and transfusing
If we were not saved, it would be a dreadful experience to be enlightened in this way by the Lord's seven lamps
When we see the river proceeding out of the throne to replace the seven lamps, we know that the building has also come
According to the book of Revelation, the seven Spirits of God are firstly the lamps burning before God's administrative throne
Eventually, in God's building, these seven Spirits of God become the river of water of life proceeding from the throne
