We need a definite start, a definite beginning, of the God-ordained way. The churches may agree with the God-ordained way, but there has not been much practice of this way. This is because the traditional way of Christianity, the way of one man speaking and the rest listening, makes people lazy and idle. One speaker is hired to do the work of many. They are only required to give their offerings and listen to some speaking. But to take the God-ordained way makes everyone busy. All of the believers must be exercised to visit people with the gospel. The success of this God-ordained way has been fully proven, but there is the need of our faithfulness in offering our body as a living sacrifice to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY<br>TO MAKE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>CLEAR TO THE CONGREGATION<br>OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>We should take the opportunity to make the God-ordained way clear to the congregation of the church. There are many printed messages concerning the God-ordained way that we can read and study. Then we can take some time in the regular meetings of the church to speak to the saints, making the God-ordained way clear to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT PUSHING THE CONGREGATION<br>TO TAKE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>We should not push the congregation to take the God-ordained way. We should just present the knowledge of this way to the saints. Whether they would take this way immediately or wait is up to them. I believe that at least ten percent of the saints will accept our word and will start to practice the new way. We can go on with these ones.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | First | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Have a Definite Beginning of the God-ordained Way in a Local Church &nbsp; pg 1</div><br></body></html>
