   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO PARTICIPATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the eyes of God everything has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then how can we participate in all of this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are going to participate and partake of all these things, we must realize the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Teachings and doctrines can never help us to partake.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Religion and Christianity cannot help us to participate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only the sevenfold intensified Spirit can work this out for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the very outset, this book speaks of the seven Spirits of God before His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the first means by which we can participate in all these victories.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why we are so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not think that we do not have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do, but we do not care for all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are so happy because we realize the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the first thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the second is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are going to participate in all these victories, we must be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The local churches are the places, the locations, and the means for us to realize all the victories of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no other place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was in the denominations for years, and I never knew this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was taught so much about this book, but I never knew this book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This book was never opened to me because I was not on the right standing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But one day I came into the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then this last book of the Bible became so transparently clear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is by the seven Spirits, and it is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third thing we must see to participate in all these things is the different Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In all these chapters, have you seen the different Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the burning One with seven eyes, and He is the Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter 7 He is the other Angel who puts the seal of God upon God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter 8 He is another Angel, who puts the incense into the prayers of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then in chapter 10 He is the strong Angel who comes down from heaven to take possession of the sea and the land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter 14 He is the One like the Son of Man sitting on the cloud with the sickle to reap the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter 18 He is the Angel with great authority, illuminating the earth and crying strongly, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Besides all the other aspects we have seen in the previous chapters, there are also these five aspects in chapters 7, 8, 10, 14, and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the book of Revelation, He is not a small Christ, a gentle Christ, a kind Christ, a patient Christ, or a suffering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is a different Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Christianity there are many messages about Christ being so patient, so suffering, and so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the last book of the Bible tells us about a different Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is no longer patient and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, in chapter 19 He is the King of kings and Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Revelation Christ is so different, so bold, so fierce, so burning, and so living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not in the Epistles today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we are in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to know this different Christ, this other Angel: Oh, the seven Spirits; oh, the local churches; and oh, the different Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the fourth thing that we must see in order to participate is life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all must know life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Revelation is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not pay attention to the forms, the regulations, the teachings, the doctrines, Christianity, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, we must pay our full attention to life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are in the seven Spirits, if we are in the local churches, and if we experience the different Christ, we will be so much in life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Day and night, morning and evening, all the time we will be praising and shouting for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we will have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will participate in all the victories by means of the seven Spirits, the local churches, the different Christ, life, and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise the Lord that He has led us to and stationed us in the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we experience life through the sevenfold intensified Spirit and stand on the proper, unique ground of oneness for the unique expression of the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We share a different Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why we are beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We just cannot help it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must be so, because this Christ is so different, and the life is so abundant in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is nothing left for us to do but praise Him and enjoy His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>THE WAY TO BE VICTORIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today, if you were to ask me how to be victorious, I would tell you that there is no need for you to try to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Just say from deep within, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! and you will be so victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Just praise the Lord and realize that today is the day of the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then you must be in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must realize that Christ is so living, so bold, and so burning within you as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why do we say O Lord ?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is because when we say O Lord, we touch the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We say Amen to what?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We say Amen to the sevenfold Spirit, Amen to the local churches, and Amen to the Christ so bold, so fierce, so burning, and so living.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>O Lord, the sevenfold Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>O Lord, the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>O Lord, the Christ so bold, so living, so burning, and so rich!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are simply victorious this way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no need of trying or doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Just say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Just praise the Lord, and you will be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you praise Him in this way for five or ten minutes, you will be over all and strengthened in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is because you contact the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is not a religion, Christianity, a lot of doctrines, or a set of teachings, forms, or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No. It is the living Christ, the present Christ, the instant Christ, and the up-to-date Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is simply by realizing the sevenfold Spirit, being in the local churches, and realizing that Christ is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then start to praise: O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then everything will be under your feet, and you will enjoy the victory found in the book of Revelation.</S>
