These items of recovery have occupied God's children so much that they have not had the energy to see God's further recovery
In the English translations of the Bible, the Greek word for building up is often translated as 'edification' instead of 'building up'
If the word for build up is translated as 'edify,' it conveys only the thought of education rather than the meaning of building
We understood edification as a matter of individual experience and had no consciousness of its relation to corporate building up
In the Bible building refers not only to individuals being edified but also to the saints being built together
Since the words for building up and house have the same root in Greek, building up means to build all the saints up as a house
If the church is merely the Body, we may think that there is no need for building up; however, the Body is also a house
If we cannot apprehend the fact that the Body is a house, we will question the need for the Body to be built up
Our work is not merely for the edification of the saints in general; rather, it is to build up a Body, a spiritual house
Ephesians 2:22 says that in Christ the Jews and Gentiles are 'being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
Corinthians 3:10 says that Paul, as a wise master builder, laid a foundation and that we should take heed how we build upon it
According to the verses above, God's desire in this age is to build the church, which is His house, the Body of Christ
Hebrews 11:10 says that Abraham 'eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God'
He does not have the church on earth as one building and the holy city, the New Jerusalem, in the heavens as another city
God is not temporarily dwelling in the church today only to discard the church and move to the New Jerusalem in the future
In its initial stage it is a house, and in its mature stage it will be a city, which is the tabernacle of God with men
Even though the New Testament refers to the edification of individual saints, its focus is on the building of God's house
We often have strong feelings concerning saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we lack feeling concerning building God's house
We need to be careful concerning the way we build, the materials we build with, and the outcome of our building
May the brothers and sisters see that saving sinners and edifying the saints are related to the central goal of building God's house
The two most important matters in the building up of the church Gods house are the administration of the church and the ministry of the word
In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
The gift that excels in building up the church is prophesying, because prophesying is a matter of the ministry of the word
After the church became desolate, the apostle spoke of the administration of the church in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus
The administration of the church and other matters related to the elders are not spoken of in the book of Romans
The books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus clearly speak of the administration by the elders because the church had become desolate at that time
At a certain time the ministry of the word was not sufficient; there was the need for the administration of the church
If the administration of a local church and the ministry of the word are poor, the church will not be built up
Since we have a part in this building, we must see the administration of the church and the ministry of the word
We might not all be able to speak and fulfill the ministry of the word as prophets, nor can all of us administrate the church as elders
In principle, those who have a part in God's work should learn to administrate the church and minister the word
The sequence in the Bible, however, first presents the ministry of the word and then the administration of the church
When the church becomes desolate and disorderly, there is a need for the administration of the church and the ministry of the word
The ministry of the word and the administration of the church go together; it is difficult to say which is first and which is second
The brothers, especially those who minister the word and those who serve as elders, need to see the responsibility they bear
In such a situation the building will not be accomplished, because the more they 'build,' the more they tear down
Those who are involved with the work must know the principle of the administration of the church and the ministry of the word
The central work of God is His building, which depends on the administration of the church and the ministry of the word
If God does not deal with us thoroughly, His building will not be accomplished, regardless of the methods we use
It is not a matter of how well we can administrate but whether our administration is effective and can touch people
After the meeting, everyone goes home, eats lunch, rests, and returns in the evening for the bread-breaking meeting
They might not have any feeling concerning their own condition, but we need to be clear and full of feeling concerning their condition
If we are not concerned that our speaking does not produce any effect in those who listen, we do not have a burden
If the listeners are lukewarm, even though they may listen peacefully, those who minister the word should not be at peace
There is a danger that the ministry of the word in the church in Taipei may become the same as the preaching of sermons in Sunday services
When we minister the word of God, our concern should be whether we have God's speaking, not the topic of our speaking
When Brother Nee began his work in Foochow, he fasted and prayed every Saturday for the gospel meeting on the Lord's Day
Since he fasted and prayed with a heavy burden, his words were always very effective and were later published as messages
Those who speak for the Lord must have a feeling to trouble the saints to the point that they have no peace inwardly
If the serving brothers whether they serve in the childrens work or the young peoples work have this kind of consciousness they will succeed
If we have a company with many employees, its yearly earnings will not be influenced by discussions, reports, and evaluations
If we have a real burden, we will set a goal for our yearly profit, work toward this goal, and be determined to reach it
Both in the administration of the church and in the ministry of the word, the brothers are commendable in their bearing of responsibility
Without a burden, all our activity will be dead and ineffective; with a burden, we will be living and flourishing
We may speak for half a year, but those who listen might not receive anything, and our speaking will be in vain
Of being dealt with, some brothers seem to have more problems because they serve out of obligation, not burden
If the sisters fellowship together and visit people simply because it is time to do so, they are doing so out of obligation
The same applies to the administration of the church and visiting the brothers and sisters; we are at peace even if there is no result
Some brothers and sisters will weep bitterly and mourn in prayer, feeling that they cannot go on in the same way
They will feel that the gospel preaching, the administration of the church, and the condition of their meeting are unsatisfactory
A Christian can continue to work out of obligation even though he has no burden, because his conscience will bother him if he stops working
Those who truly coordinate in spirit should have a strong feeling that they cannot do anything without the help and coordination of others
Some brothers not only lack a sense of the need for the elders and deacons, but they even think that elders and deacons are unnecessary
If four brothers are living in the workers' home, they should depend on one another, and others should sense their dependence on one another
From the human perspective, this may be considered to be coordination, but this coordination is according to regulation and arrangement
Because we lack coordination in our service and do not rely and mutually depend on one another, we often step on others
Although this condition is not apparent among us, it will be in our future, because we are not willing to submit to others
Even if we are not pleased with the way others live, we cannot set standards for others, nor are we qualified to judge others
They have different dispositions and family backgrounds, and they also have different spiritual backgrounds and training
Some may speak about prayer and others about meditating; some may speak of being zealous and others of being in the Holy of Holies
One of the responsible brothers in that meeting, however, felt that John was too long and wanted to study 1 Thessalonians instead
Since he insisted, the elders eventually agreed with him even though his burden for 1 Thessalonians was not proper
If our fellowship is a matter of spiritual burden there should be no problem with proposing a change and we should not criticize the burden
Strictly speaking, it is all right to study either John or 1 Thessalonians; it does not matter which book is studied
Because of this kind of problem, our service in the administration of the church and the ministry of the word is not strong
If we have spiritual content, we can minister to the saints through 1 Thessalonians and through the Gospel of John
We should serve according to our portion and honor the portion of others, because both portions have been entrusted by the Lord
If we have spiritual content, we can minister his way, and if he has spiritual content, he can minister our way
We must be faithful to what the Lord has entrusted us with and learn to work in coordination with others, respecting what they do
Since we are serving the Lord together in His work and sharing this work together, we must rise up to utterly condemn such situations
We should not criticize others but should join their labor so that the Body of Christ can be supplied, not damaged
In this way, the feeling of coordination in the Body will be sweet, and the building up of the Body will be strong
Even our bringing people to salvation and helping the saints to be edified might not result in much building up of the church
If we are in the light, we will see that it is possible to save sinners and edify the saints without building up the church
The most serious tearing down of God's building in the church is not the result of persecution or opposition from the unbelievers
While his changing the book may edify those in his meeting, the way he does it tears down God's building up of the church
His way will only produce people with views and opinions, who like to adjust others and do not submit to others
Although this brother has a good intention and neither criticizes nor judges others, the destruction to the church is serious
The church cannot be built up if twenty-one responsible ones say, 'The elders are not necessarily right in their way of doing things
All our work in Taiwan has been building up; however, during the past six months there has been much tearing down
We need to search our heart and consider whether our work during the past six months has brought us into one accord or into dissension
The responsible brothers are in dissension if they change the intention of the elders without the feeling of tearing down
If seven of the twenty-eight home group meetings are in this condition, the church in Taipei will be in discord and scattered
If this authority is in the hands of the one thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly, we will become the church in Laodicea
If the responsible ones in the homes are like this, those in the groups will also voice their opposing opinions
Satan's work is not to cause everyone to argue; rather, it is to do a work of tearing down through man's good desire and intention
The apostles and elders gathered together before God, and after some shared their experience and light, James stood up and spoke
Those who have learned the lesson will say Amen when the elders decide that the group meetings should study the Gospel of John
We must first help the saints to accept the arrangement of the elders before suggesting that a shorter book be studied
He might not slander or oppose the elders, but in his speaking he may spread the thought of the church being a dictator
The seed of dissension that is sown into the saints can grow and eventually cause them to be in dissension with the church
Our problem is that we consider ourselves to be so smart and capable that we do not need one another; we are always stepping on others
Those who truly build up the church feel that they cannot act independently and cannot be without the brothers and sisters
When ministering the word, such a one needs the brothers and sisters to pray for him, to support him in their spirit
Those who minister the word do not seem to need the prayer of others, and those in the audience do not have a supporting spirit
In particular, the brothers and sisters who work with the young people do not have the feeling of depending on one another
If a wife does not submit to her husband and a husband does not submit to his wife, their family will lack the building
We must believe that the elders in a local church are not careless in their decisions and that they are not authoritarian in their attitude
Although they may feel that they are weak and inadequate, they bear a great responsibility and take care of the church in fear and trembling
The building up of the church through our administration of the church and ministry of the word depends on our person
If we have learned the lesson are broken and know Gods building those whom we lead will be living stones being built up as a spiritual house
The more people we save through preaching the gospel and the more people we edify will only bring more opinions into the church
Although we may speak of many different matters with people, we must know our place when we speak of matters related to the service
A brother once remarked that others were asking him if he was going to serve in Taichung, even though he was unaware of this information
Although they may be consecrated to the Lord in their service, a few sentences can tear down a year's worth of work
We need to be on the alert to see that the work in Taipei today is in discord and has fallen into Satan's scheme
The problems in the administration of the church and the ministry of the word are the result of the problem in our person
In order for our work to produce the building, many negative factors within us must be eliminated and dealt with
There are certain things we should not say, certain attitudes we should not express, and certain actions we should not take
Because those who are not restricted are unconscious of the many dissenting factors within them there is a dissenting element in their words
It is difficult to know how much breaking and restricting we need in order for our work to be in one accord and to build up others
We should never allow our words, attitudes, actions, and expressions to produce any dissension or result in any tearing down in the church
The Brethren consider the Lords word in verse 3 a word spoken to His disciples before His departure from the world to be a word of prophecy
The erroneous understanding of the Brethren is that the Lord's going was His leaving the world to go to heaven
John 14:6 means that no one can enter into the Father except through Christ; no one can contact God except through Christ
As long as God can enter into man, He can come to the earth; as long as man can enter into God, man can enter into heaven
If the God of heaven came to the earth without entering into man, it would not be considered His coming to the earth
The disciples thought the Lord was referring to a place and replied, 'We do not know where You are going; how can we know the way'?
The Lord entered into man through His incarnation, and He entered into the Father through His death and resurrection
The Lord's going in chapter 14 does not refer to His going to heaven; it refers to His going to the Father from man
The Lord entered into the Father through death and resurrection, and we entered into the Father through the Lord
The Lord wanted the disciples to know that it is not a matter of position or place but of a person, that is, the Father
Ephesians 2:21-22 says that we are growing into a holy temple in the Lord, into a dwelling place of God in spirit
God's dwelling place in heaven is merely heaven; it does not have the element of man and is not joined to the earth
The church, obtained by God as His dwelling place, is a mystery, because God has entered into man and mingled Himself with man
Such a dwelling place, the mingling of God and man and the joining of heaven and earth, is the eternal dwelling place which God is building
In these verses the Lord was saying that He would enter into the Father, and He would also bring those who believed into Him into the Father
The church is composed of the believers who are mingled with God and the condition, the element, of heaven that is also in us
Even though this can be called a place because heaven is included and is expressed on earth, it is a person because God is in man
Revelation 21:2 uses the word prepared: 'New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
In speaking of the city, verse 3 says that the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them
We are not here simply to save sinners and edify the saints; rather, our goal is God's building, His dwelling place on earth
Acts 4:11 says that Christ is the cornerstone; Ephesians 2:22 says that we are being built together in Him into a dwelling place of God
If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest'
According to verse 40, the Old Testament saints need the New Testament believers in order to receive God's promise
Although Abraham was built by God, many in the New Testament age have not been built; hence, the city has not been manifested
John 17 is the Lord's prayer in which He asked the Father to fulfill all that was spoken in chapters 14 through 16
After speaking the things in chapters 14 through 16, the Lord prayed to the Father: 'Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
Because this divine life is the divine element of God the Father, the Father is glorified in the Son through the Son's glorification
The Lord desired all His believers to be one even as the three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are one
Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?
He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me'
The preparation of a place is building; this preparation work is the work of building, which results in oneness
If a brother is not experiencing the building, it is difficult for him to be one with the brothers and sisters in the church
Before the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the one hundred and twenty in the upper room were in one accord
For this reason, we cannot stay away from the church; we cannot stay away from the brothers and sisters with whom we are to be built up
We do not abound in God's blessing, and His presence is not evident among us, because there is not enough building among us
We do not care for the condition of the brothers and sisters and are not bothered about being an isolated Christian
If the full-time serving ones are harmonious, coordinated, and in one accord, the meeting will be strong, rich, and full of blessing
If we only have separate car parts that are nicely painted, the car will not move, because the separated parts are not 'built up'
The result is that the prayers and activities in the meetings are independent and individualistic, not corporate and not in oneness
In the Lord's table meeting all the saints in the church in Nanking testified the same thing; they were our letters of commendation
If there is no one accord among us, we cannot expect any blessing even if we labor diligently without quarrels or arguments
Others may achieve great success with little effort, but we have little success no matter how much we apply ourselves
It will not cause the saints to serve the Lord in love, being dependent on one another and making them His dwelling place
Our speaking may bring people to salvation and cause people to become spiritual, but it cannot produce something for the building
Although the local churches stand on the proper ground, the situation among the churches seems to be one of self-government
Although they may not quarrel or argue with others, they are unable to get along with others and serve the Lord together in one accord
If we want to have the Lord's blessing and His presence, and if we want others to be edified, we need to learn to be built up
If we have seen this light, we will prostrate ourselves before God and say, 'I cannot live independently of others
When he wrote the Epistle of 1 Corinthians he said Paul a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God and Sosthenes the brother
Everyone is capable, the younger ones and the older ones, and it seems as if there is no need to depend on one another
The older ones think that they are more experienced and know everything concerning the administration of the church
Can the Catholic Church edify two or three million people so that they are in one accord, love one another, and stand for God?
In the same principle, the elders not only need to administrate the church, but they also need to build up the church
The qualification for being an elder does not depend on skill or mental capacity but on being broken and subdued
Our service may save people and cause them to be spiritual and love the Lord zealously, but they will not be built up
The Lord said that if two or three are gathered in harmony, He will be with them, and their prayer will be answered
God's blessing is based on our one accord, being in harmony in spirit with one another, having real coordination, and having genuine oneness
Pride is a source of suspicion, and it causes a person to think that the elders highly regard others but not him
If we hope to be equally loved and praised by those who love and praise the Lord, we will reap the fruit of our labor one day
We may think that we are competent in administrating the church, but after three years the church will be in rebellion
We should not say that those who serve the Lord should be respected in order to attract others to serve the Lord
Walking on this pathway is altogether a matter between God and us; it has nothing to do with anyone or anything else
The Lord stood with him and empowered him so that through him 'the proclamation of the gospel might be fully accomplished'
In such a situation it is difficult for us to have the blessing; it is difficult for our work to produce an organic result
As long as we are those who are being built, no matter where we are placed or what we are asked to do, we are in the building
Everything depends on whether we are being built by the Lord, not on whether we are asked to minister the word
When people in the world see the oneness of the serving ones, they can believe that the Lord was sent by God, that He is the Christ of God
If we deserved His love and treated the Lord well, we might be deserving of love, but such a love could be based on emotion
The more building there is among us, however, the more the characteristic of love and concern will be expressed
If there is the genuine love, the four brothers will immediately check on the condition of the brother who is missing
If we observe that a certain brother always wears the same shirt, we need to find out whether he has any other shirts
We may be able to administrate the church in an orderly manner, but there is no building up in our administration
When we buy a pair of shoes, we should think of our brothers' shoes; when we have a suit made, we should think of our brothers' suit
By the Lords mercy we should be able to testify that the more we bear others burdens the more the Lord bears our burdens and strengthens us
If we care for those who serve with us, our ministry of the word and our administration of the church will be able to build up the saints
If an elder desires his administration of the church to bring in the building, he must learn to love and care for people
If a person who is indifferent becomes an elder or ministers the word, he can edify the saints but not build them up
A brother might not be able to give dynamic messages, but when he administrates the church, the saints are blended and built up
The gathering of several thousand people is not the church if they live independently and are not built together
When brothers and sisters serve and meet together in love, their gospel preaching will be prevailing, and many will be brought to salvation
The more a person has been worked on and built by the Lord, the more he is concerned for others, cares for others, and loves others
In a house there is no need for the wood to love the bricks or for the bricks to love the tiles, because they are dead
The normal condition should be that we do not notice when a brother purchases new socks, but we notice his worn socks
We need to love the brothers and sisters and care for them, but such a love should be based on their need, not our emotions
If we do not learn these points, we should not expect our administration of the church and our ministry of the word to build up the church
Some people think that the elders should be humble and careful and that those who minister the word should be cautious with their words
These qualities will not cause the brothers and sisters to have a high regard for us, much less to be built up
We need to know people for the administration of the church, and we also need to know people for the ministry of the word
If we do not know people, we cannot build up the church; rather, the church will be brought into confusion and torn down
If he does not know the nature of wood and uses it indiscriminately, the houses he builds will be dangerous to live in
If our motives have never been dealt with by the Lord, it will be difficult for us to see whether others are pure in their motives
If our flesh has never been dealt with and we have never learned the lesson of being broken, we will not know when others are in their flesh
It is very important for the elders who administrate the church to know the intentions, motives, and purposes of the brothers and sisters
It will be the same as installing a time bomb in a building; at a certain time the bomb will explode, and the entire building will collapse
We cannot forbid people from speaking in the church meetings, but we must observe them and see if their ways are proper
If their ways are improper, we should exhort them so that they know that their ways are not encouraged or approved
A lack of knowledge concerning people will only cause the church to suffer loss even though we have no intention to tear down the church
If our motives have never been dealt with by the Lord, we should not think that we can know the motives of others
If our motives have been dealt with and are pure, our ministry of the word will not produce 'side-effects' or result in mixture
We may not be able to sense the purity in their heart, but we will immediately recognize the filthiness within them
A person whose flesh has never been dealt with or who has never learned any lessons concerning the flesh can never coordinate in service
Since it is difficult to find a person whose flesh has been absolutely dealt with we should not assign people to any service unconditionally
In other words, a person's assignment in a service should match the degree to which his flesh has been dealt with
If he has had little dealing, we should not assign him much responsibility in the service; this can lead to problems
A carpenter must first look at his material in order to know the nature, condition, and size of the material to use in the building
They rejoice when they see a brother who loves the Lord and immediately make him responsible for a group meeting
Since his motive is impure and his self has not been dealt with, his 'tricks' all become apparent within a few weeks
To discern a person's spiritual level is to know whether or not his spiritual condition is rich, strong, high, and pure
Assigning a person responsibility in the service according to a knowledge of these three points will result in the proper building
Sometimes a brother may give a message that is directed to one person because he feels uneasy speaking directly with the person
Although we are clear that we are speaking to him, our word will touch everyone because everyone needs such a word
None of the Epistles in the New Testament were written by first receiving God's revelation and applying it to certain needs
Those who minister the word must know the genuine condition of those who listen and bring their situation before God
When we spoke of that brother's problem, Brother Nee told us that the entire Lord's Day message was spoken for him
In the administration of the church and the ministry of the word we need to know people in order to have the building
The improper conditions manifested among the serving ones indicate that their consecration is not thorough or is weak
They would rather that we compromise in our service, that is, that we be moderate, neutral, or less than absolute in our service
If we would be absolute in our consecration continually, those who support us will decrease and our suffering will increase
If all the serving ones today consecrated themselves like the early apostles, they would experience many sufferings and hardships
We cannot condemn the young saints, but they should consider whether their consecration has been strengthened or weakened
Although these brothers had a good intention, we should ask, 'Whose house is more important, God's house or ours'?
None of the children of the Western missionaries oppose their parents, because the missionaries care too much for their families
A certain responsible brother has five children, and the group meeting he is responsible for has over a hundred saints
If he only takes care of the one hundred brothers and sisters, he would not be able to take adequate care of his family
If we imitate the Western missionaries in how they care for their families, the result of our labor in the church will match theirs
Many talented ones have been wrecked by Him many good students good professors good fathers and good mothers have all been wrecked by Him
They should not simply say that the young people love the world and have no reality; rather, they need to consider their condition
If he is occupied with his studies, he will not have room for Jesus, and if he is occupied with Jesus, he will not have room for his studies
It is impossible for a person to serve the Lord properly and also be a good doctor or a good father in the eyes of the world
We need to conduct ourselves in a manner that is respectable and worthy of man's praise when we serve the Lord and preach the word
If we devote ourselves to care for our careers, studies, and families, we should not expect the church to flourish
If we give our careers and families priority and put the Lord and the church in second place, the church will have no increase
If we live a comfortable and easy life and do not pay a price to follow the Lord, our children will want to follow us
Because those who serve the Lord in China have taken the way of consecration, none of their children have desired to serve
When we do the work of building up the church, our fame, reputation, family, energy, and natural man will be wrecked
Those who desire to serve the Lord and maintain respectability in their family, career, and studies have taken the wrong way
If we want to do a work of Christianity, we can regard what pertains to us as primary and what pertains to the Lord as secondary
The way of consecration is a way of suffering, a way of sacrifice, in which everything that pertains to us is wrecked
Because of this, some are able to rebuke us, saying that we are the parasites of society since we depend on others for our living
A person who is truly concerned should put something in the offering box without asking how much a serving one receives
When we are in this condition, we can do the work of Christianity, but we cannot do the work of building up the church
When the ship she was on arrived at the port of Marseilles France she told the captain that she had to go back to China to preach the gospel
On the one hand, we should thank the Lord and rejoice that this brother is willing to be used in this way by the Lord
If we simply thank the Lord and accept the offering, our work is not for the building up of the church; rather, it will tear down the church
We should not simply thank the Lord for this brother, thinking that this is a timely offering to help the saints in need
We should not think that simply by distributing the fifty thousand dollars to the poor the church will be built up
Discerning matters is related not only to the administration of the church but even to the ministry of the word
We may give a message to discourage instead of a message to encourage if we lack knowledge concerning a certain matter
Two Western brothers, one of whom was a doctor, were among us for a period of time, but their work was not very profitable
In relation to the building up of the church, we felt that receiving them into the service would result in a great loss
It is a fact, however, that our contact with these two brothers gave rise to many problems instead of the building up of the church
According to our realization, problems could arise because we did not fully know what kind of persons these brothers were
On the way we saw a sister whose child had contracted tuberculosis and had been operated on twice by this brother
They would not have a feeling of being debased before men; they would not feel that they had received help from man or even from the church
If our help causes the brothers and sisters to feel inferior or indebted to us, we are tearing down the church rather than building it up
If we maintain an attitude of giving alms, showing pity, or assisting the poor saints, we are corrupting the Lord's church
Although the sister whose son had contracted tuberculosis repeatedly thanked and praised the Lord, her entire being was corrupted
Those who always receive help from others cannot be built up in their character, and the church cannot be built up
When we take care of the needy brothers and sisters, we must consider whether our care is for their building up or for their tearing down
The past one hundred years of Christian work here has not built up the church; instead, it has damaged and torn down the church
The Western missionaries need to learn the lesson of helping people before the Lord without making them their beneficiaries
Many of the brothers were associated with them for a long time, considering that everything from the West was good and helpful
We do need the supply from the West in many areas, but this does not mean that everything from the West is correct
Before they rendered a supply, they adjusted others; before their capability was manifested, they criticized others
We have invited Western brothers with great expectations, but the result of their visit causes us to be fearful
If we always appreciate the things of the West and despise the things of the East, the church will never be built up
Although we cannot interfere in the matters that do not involve us, we should not neglect the matters that involve us
We should understand every matter that comes to us, and we should grasp the opportunity to edify and teach those who are involved
In our work and service we must realize that being proud is meaningless and that considering ourselves inferior is even worse
There is no value in thinking that we are always right; neither is there any value in thinking that we are always wrong
In this way we will know how to help a person be built up into the church; we will know also how to handle the matter
Even if eighty percent of the things from the West are good, at least twenty percent of the things in the East are also good
Two days ago a Western brother said that several serving ones from the workers' house were at a birthday party with his family
To celebrate their children's birthday and even invite serving ones to participate is a fleshly act that will damage the Lord's work
Otherwise, our labor will be according to a Chinese proverb which says that we are grinding soybeans without producing any tofu
Before inviting a Western brother to speak, we considered the fact that he had publicly thanked those who sent him Christmas cards
In order for the churches in the East and the West to be built up, the brothers from the West must be open to the church ground
We respect the spiritual ministries from the West, but we do not agree that everything from the West is correct
Merely preaching the gospel to save sinners and edifying the believers cannot build up the genuine church of the Lord
Most people think that building enables us to coordinate together so that we are no longer separate individuals but a corporate Body
In other words, the building is built with the Father's divine nature, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's transforming work
According to the Bible, there are two aspects to God's building in the universe: one is a dwelling place, and the other is a city
With the exception of the tower of Babel, every building spoken of in the Bible is either a dwelling place or a city
According to Ephesians 2:22, God is building a dwelling place; according to Hebrews 11:10, God is building a city with foundations
In the Old Testament the holy temple typifies God's dwelling place, and the holy city typifies the New Jerusalem
When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, from their point of view they obtained the blessing of a land flowing with milk and honey
If we have been built and have learned the lesson of building, we will realize that these brothers are lacking in the mingling
If they would allow those parts to be dealt with, they would be mingled with God, and God's temple would be in them
The brothers who speak from the podium must be sure that their words will issue in God being mingled more with the saints
The New Jerusalem is a city, which is a matter of authority, and God's tabernacle with men, which is a matter of dwelling
The center of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is a matter of God's sovereign power, God's authority
To build the temple is to build God's habitation that God may have the ground in man, dwell in man, and mingle Himself with man
First there is the church, the house of God, the temple of God, and then there is the manifestation of the New Jerusalem
When we have God's authority and reigning over us, we can be joined with those who are also under God's authority to become a city
After we are built, we will know whether the inward being of a person whom we contact is desolate or whether he has God's presence
In other words, we need to build God's presence into him so that he can have a measure of God's temple, God's presence, and God's mingling
After we have worked on a person for some time, he will have some building in him, and he will eventually have God's temple in him
When we build God's temple into a person, we must also build God's city-God's sovereign power, His authority-into him
Not only must we see that there is authority and order in the church, but we must also see that the entire universe is a matter of authority
The building work we are doing begins with building God's mingling into man and consummates with the building of God's authority over man
The more a person is mingled with God and the more authority of God a person has, the more he will be joined with others
Merely having good conduct is not enough in the church, because the church is a matter of being built under God's authority
Our work is to let people know what it means to have the mingling of God and man and what it means to be under God's authority
In other words, if we know God's presence without knowing His authority, we do not have the city and the temple
It seems as if the enemy did not desire to frustrate the building of the temple as much as he desired to frustrate the building of the city
The enemy is clear that if there is no city, the temple can easily be destroyed; hence, he damages the matter of authority and order
We must first know whether we are under God's authority and are keeping our position in the order arranged by God
If we are built by God and are subjected under His authority, we can then help others by doing a work of building in them
When we work on others, we first add God into them so that they have God's presence in their practical walk and living
In spiritual warfare it is more crucial to understand the enemy's stratagems than it is to pick up a sword to deal with the enemy
If we do not know a matter, we will not know the enemy's stratagems, and it will be easy for us to fall victim to his devices
In principle, the elders in our district or local church should have the administrative authority to determine what size the cup should be
The administrative authority for this problem is with the elders, not the ones responsible for a group meeting
Even if a local church uses a large cup, but a district wants to use small cups, the decision still depends on the elders
If we want to take the way of the Gentiles to practice democracy in the church, we will lose God's presence and protection
The church should function in this way, and the administration of any country should also function in this way
In order for a new measure to become a law, the legislative body of a country must function appropriately and legally
The ones who have learned the lesson before the Lord and have been perfected know that there is order in the church
Those who desire to do the work of God's building need to learn serious lessons and see through the enemy's stratagems
Our opinion may be correct but we can still be persons who do not walk according to order do not obey authority and have not been dealt with
A brother responsible for a group meeting does not have the authority to decide something concerning the administration of the church
If the churches in Taiwan use large cups for the Lord's table, it is foolishness for a group meeting to change to small cups
Building up authority does not mean building up our personal authority; rather, it means building up God's order in the church
May the Lord be gracious to us that we would know His building for the administration of the church and for the ministry of the word
Our ministering the word must supply people with life, solve their problems, and create a feeling of need in them
If a minister of the word thinks that he does not need to use material from others' publications, he is proud and foolish
A minister of the word may also be tempted to believe that he only needs material from books published in Christianity
The basic material for the ministry of the word should be the lessons a person has learned and the burdens he has received from the Lord
We may consult others for their views, explanations, and illustrations related to the lesson we learned and the burden we received
If a minister of the word does not learn any lessons and never receives any burdens from the Lord, he should not speak from the podium
For this reason, those who minister the word must continually learn lessons by being dealt with by the Lord in great and small things
There is the need for us to receive the burden to lead the brothers and sisters into the feeling that they need building
Even if our material is better, when we consult with others, our knowledge will be broadened and our feeling for the word will be deepened
A person's speaking is degraded and sinful if he must search for material from books because he has nothing to speak
The release of the word that is not based on experience or a burden received from the Lord is an offense to God
When we prepare a message, we should avoid the thought of being original by using material that is new and unusual
We should avoid material that expounds Scripture since such material does not contain much life and is subject to error
Strictly speaking, only those with the gift of teaching should expound Scripture, and not everyone has this gift
John Sung used the 'flow of blood' in Luke 8:43 to give a sermon on the Lord's precious blood, without expounding the verse
An authoritative expositor among the Brethren said that the one who was left was the best, and he gave many reasons in support
Even though we highly regard the spiritual matters Brother Austin-Sparks ministered to us, we cannot go along with this exposition
Throughout the centuries different spiritual persons have expounded the Bible, but it was difficult for them not to make mistakes
She said that being saved was not equivalent to being regenerated and those who were saved still needed to repent in order to be regenerated
It is best not to select material that touches Bible exposition unless there is a definite need, and we are sure of its accuracy
We should not give children the concept that the children's meeting is a course of study, and that they are required to recite and memorize
If they can be impressed with matters concerning how to be a proper human being, fearing God, or salvation, it will be a help to them
We should not give lessons like elementary school teachers, who divide the children into groups and conduct classes
We might speak to the children about loving their brothers and sisters, about God's love, and how God created men with a loving heart
We should give them the feeling that the love within them comes from God and that they should love their brothers and sisters
The brothers who minister may speak much, but their first priority must be to give people something living and to touch their inner being
The meat of a steak is attached to the bones, but when we serve the steak, we should give meat instead of bones
We should learn to use material that can touch people's feeling so that they are touched even if they do not understand much of the message
We should not give the brothers and sisters homework; rather, we should touch their feeling to plant something solid into them
If we merely save sinners and edify them, we are repeating the work of Christianity for the past one hundred years
When a person is built up in Kaohsiung, if he leaves Kaohsiung to go to either Hualien or Tainan, he is still built up
Even though he leaves Kaohsiung he has not left the building he is still a part of the spiritual house which is not limited by time or space
Only such a person can be part of God's dwelling place and can function as a member of the Body of Christ wherever he goes
If we want to participate in this work, we need the administration of the church, and even more, we need the ministry of the word
As a result they will be unable to rest after the meeting because something has been injected into their being
We must fellowship, through prayer and consideration, with those whom we serve concerning the content of our speaking
The speaking touched their problem and their inner being; hence, their problem was solved, and their need was met
Printing was not as convenient as it is today, and there were not that many arrangements, but everything was living
We should know the different problems of the saints, the problems of the children, the young people, and the elderly ones
The children's meeting, the young people's meeting, and the Lord's Day meeting are all conducted according to dead ordinances
The Lord's work and the church are suffering a great loss, and the main responsibility is with those who minister the word
The supply in the ministry of the word is important to the children, the young people, the parents, the elderly, and the working saints
Generally speaking, however, the administration of the church is weaker than the ministry of the word in all the localities
There is a greater need for the ministry of the word than for the administration of the church in all the localities
The Bible-reading meeting in the local church that we mentioned earlier has a person who is responsible for the meeting
Since the saints come together only once a week, some churches encouraged the saints to read one chapter a day at home
Of course, we should not use gimmicks, but we should give the saints the feeling that they have gained something
Recently a church began a meeting for the pursuit of Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures on the Lord's Day evening
Another church in the south of Taiwan began a Bible-reading meeting in which the attendance went from sixty people to one hundred forty
They should not speak concerning this point lightly but should repeat it emphatically until the saints receive it
We need to take care of the elders, the deacons, those who visit people, and those who are burdened to preach the gospel
If we do not take care of all the needs, our locality may be perfected in one need but be lacking in another need
Without the ministry of the word, the meeting will be tasteless and the saints will lose the desire to attend the meeting
When the wind blows from the east, the meeting drifts toward the west; when the wind blows from the west, the meeting drifts toward the east
The hearts of the brothers and sisters should be stirred up, and they should be helped to open their mouth one by one to pray in the meeting
Any educational speaking for correction, instruction, or explanation should be given after the bread-breaking meeting
We should avoid giving an educational word prior to and during the breaking of the bread, because it will distract the saints from the Lord
We had numerous situations of this nature that were not educational but included a considerable amount of education
On the cross the Lord's blood was shed, which constitutes the cup of salvation for us, and this cup runs over with blessing
As we remember Him, when we see the cup, we should realize that He drank the cup of wrath, which was our portion, on our behalf
We should also point out the Lord's beauty and loveliness so that others can have a real and sweet knowledge of Him
If they come to the meeting time after time, but they do not know how to sing hymns and pray like others, they can only listen to others
Those who take the lead in the meetings, particularly those who minister the word, bear the main responsibility
They praised the Lord for His sweetness and for the fruit of His labor, declaring that they were satisfied with Him
New believers will feel that the meeting is meaningless if they do not gain much nor hear any speaking with spiritual content
Those who minister the word should spend time before the Lord daily, studying how to minister the word in the bread-breaking meeting
We should speak concerning the Lord's work and person, His exaltation, His name, His glory, and His second coming
We should always speak with feeling, touching on the fact that God's love is with power and that His power is manifested in His love
If we merely say that the Lord's power is great, even greater than atomic energy, the brothers and sisters may forget His loveliness
They may have the sweet feeling that the Lord is shedding His blood in their presence and that the flow of His blood is for them to drink
Those who are responsible for the meetings should not feel at peace if there is no supply in the bread-breaking meeting
Those who serve in the ministry of the word should study how to minister the word in the bread-breaking meeting and in the prayer meeting
We should minister the word in the prayer meeting without being long or killing the spirit of prayer and disrupting the mood for prayer
Presently, the number of saints attending the bread-breaking meeting in Manila is more than those who attend the Lord's Day morning meeting
We were successful in northern China because we labored for many years, and we concentrated on only one local church
If there is no one to adjust the meeting, it may be difficult for the spirit of the brothers and sisters to be uplifted
As long as they desire to gain the Lord and are able to receive the spiritual supply in the meetings, they will want to come to the meetings
In the previous chapter we considered our need to study how to use the ministry of the word to uplift the meetings of the church
In addition, the ministry of the word should be living and practical; it does not depend on lofty subjects and deep content
The brothers and sisters do not need profound words in order to be supplied they simply need ordinary words in order for them to be supplied
In 1942 a brother who was meeting in a denomination often came to our meetings in order to hear the gospel messages
Our speaking should render even experienced believers a supply that is as fresh, cool, and watering as the morning dew
Even though regeneration is an 'old' topic that has been spoken about many times, we should still give people a fresh supply in their spirit
We must seek to have a word for these responsible brothers, and we must seek to have a word to supply all the needs of the saints
We can speak concerning Christ, the Son of God, the cross, dealing with the flesh, and other topics that supply the saints
We must learn how to supply the various needs of the saints; otherwise, the saints will know only one truth, and they will become unbalanced
When the brothers and sisters are strong in a certain item but weak in other items, it is difficult for the church to advance
General Tseng Kuo-fan was a literary writer, but he was able to overturn the rebellious government called the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace
The main focus may be how to deal with the flesh and to know Christ, but it is still necessary to supply the word in other aspects
These aspects have nothing to do with justification by faith, yet they are attached to justification by faith, the central message
He must daily spend the time to study, practice, and learn from the famous performers of the past and the present
We should spend time to daily consider and study the condition of the brothers and sisters and the situation of the church
If we endeavor to study, we will exercise our spirit, receive a burden, and minister to people according to the need
When we exercise our spirit in a wedding meeting, we will know the need of the couple and share a word to meet the need
When we are in a memorial service, we will know whether the family needs comforting or strengthening and supply them accordingly
Of course, we do not pay attention to outward things, but the way we speak can greatly affect the release of the word
We are all ambassadors of the kingdom of God, diplomats, who interact with the devil's kingdom on earth every day
He exercises magnanimity to withdraw and consider the situation to see if he has the basis to give a clear response
He does not become angry immediately after he has been offended, nor is he willing to do things for others based on his mood
A person who cannot learn these three matters cannot become a good diplomat even if he has a wealth of knowledge
Another preacher would run down from the platform, around the meeting hall, and then back up to the platform when giving a message
The ability to touch people is basically the work of the Holy Spirit; however, certain things can frustrate this work
Reading something horizontally can frustrate this work whereas reading the same thing vertically can assist this work
In the same way, proper deportment not only removes people's resistance to the Holy Spirit but also assists the work of the Spirit
Being sober before our parents expresses one kind of deportment, but the deportment before our children is different
Where there is no administration, there is no building, but if there is administration, there is also a need to build people up together
The twelve elders in the church in Taipei may arrange to have twenty-eight brothers responsible for the group meetings
The elders should not stop at appointing responsible brothers who could bear responsibility for the home meeting
They should continue in prayer and fellowship until they are able to speak with this brother concerning the problems
Any part of the stone that protrudes needs to be ground away in order for another stone to be secure when it is placed on top of it
He observes the brothers and sisters and knows when they are ready to bear responsibility or when they need some training
An elder may be burdened to spend six months with them so that they may be perfected and continue to function in the ministry of the word
When a saint has a problem, the elders should study the situation and take care of it according to the building
If the problem is not properly taken care of, other saints will also have problems, and the building will be frustrated
The giving was done under the leading of the administration of the church, ensuring that the recipient would truly benefit from the offering
The elders should not work separately; they should coordinate together as one person to observe all the sides of a situation
Three-fourths of the time and energy in the elders' meeting should be spent on the spiritual situation of the saints
We cannot do without the business aspect of the administration of the church, but we need more practice on how much to use our time on it
Administrating the spiritual needs of the saints requires much more effort and time than the mere management of business affairs
It requires our patience, wisdom, and strong will to do everything in love, not according to natural affection
He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust ; this is grace
In the same principle, we can save many people and perfect them to become spiritual, but this cannot satisfy the desire of God's heart
Rather, all the believers are built together into a city in which the foundations and wall are precious stones, and the gates are pearls
God desires a dwelling place, a Body, but He has encountered many difficulties during the past two thousand years
The ripened harvest and the imminent reaping refer to the Lord's reaping of His mature believers at His coming
Because there is no building, those who are enlightened will mourn over the desolate situation; they will not rejoice
We mourn daily for this because no one speaks concerning the building up of the church and because there is not much building among us
Surely we should pay attention to the propagation of the work, but we should pay even more attention to the building
We should be able to build the believers up one by one into the Body of Christ, into a corporate vessel of God on earth
If our desire is merely to edify people for their individual spirituality, there is not much more for us to learn
If we desire to participate in the work of the building, there are many lessons to learn, and we need to be corrected in many areas
We should focus on all the believers, not on specific individuals, so that they might become a corporate vessel
We are being built up in our coordination with others, and we are learning how to administrate and help others
Similarly, the practice of the Lord's table is not a matter of a big cup or a small cup but of returning to the practice in the beginning
The apostle Paul says, 'Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread'
The Bible speaks of the church in Jerusalem , the church in Antioch , the church in Corinth , and the church in Ephesus
The impact of such a testimony to the church of God is beyond estimation, and the impact is even greater on the children of God
We need to see that in this age and in this universe, God intends to do a work of building, and this building work must be on a ground
A Western brother who was affected by Brother Austin-Sparks has asked why we say that only we are the church and that others are not
Brother Austin-Sparks replied that none of the groups were absolutely right, but that they were relatively right
When asked what he meant by relatively right, he said, 'Each group should be measured according to the stature of Christ
God desired that His people stay in the land of Israel and take Jerusalem as the center in their worshipping Him
Using New Testament terms, Daniel was full of Christ, but such a Christ-filled, spiritual person remained in Babylon
When other believers would go to Samaria, should they take the measure of Christ as the criterion and meet with the Pauline sect?
Brother Austin-Sparks also saw that we had come to an impasse, and he discontinued the fellowship meeting the next day
He said that he and another Western brother were satisfied with our replies and that there was no need to continue the discussion
We respect Brother Austin-Sparks' spiritual portion, but we disagree with his view concerning the ground of the church
Even though we might not understand the scope of these matters, my speaking is for our future work in other places
If we want to build the church of the Lord, we need to understand the ground of the church; otherwise, there is no way to have the building
We want God's children to know that God has no way in the denominations, because they cannot produce the building
If we change our attitude and drop the matter of the ground, the brothers will become wandering stars with no way to proceed
If we do not take the way of the truth, others will, and when those who take the way of the truth question us, we will be speechless
When a brother who is baptized by immersion questions him, he will be unable to reply and will fall under the condemnation of the truth
We need to love the Lord and be spiritual and we need to be mingled with God and have His authority so we can be joined together with others
Their conduct and view force us to be passive and maintain a distance even though we do not break off fellowship
The notes of the messages were compiled and published as Rethinking the Work, now published with the title The Normal Christian Church Life
My desire is for us to understand this matter because the administration of the church among us depends on our understanding
Today transportation in the world is convenient and available to everyone; people come from different places to fellowship with us
Regardless of how much we speak, however, we need a vision and revelation concerning these things so that we may have a genuine seeing
In the beginning of the work in the East, God gave us the feeling that the condition of Christianity was not proper
We abandoned these practices and in each item endeavored to return to the way it was in the beginning according to the Bible
In the beginning we did not experience an instantaneous recovery of many items; instead, it was a recovery of item by item
We were able to speak a little on the truth concerning sectarianism, but we were not clear concerning the definition of a sect
We knew that if a church has a particular name, a particular fellowship, and a particular belief, it is a sect
Some places had the condition of Philadelphia; they showed signs of the revival prophesied by the Lord in the seven epistles in Revelation
On the spiritual side, it was also at this time that he saw the central light concerning Christ as God's centrality and universality
Many points in the letter were concerning denominations; it defined a denomination and the meaning of denominationalism
After this, Brother Nee was not the only one who was clear concerning all these matters; we, his co-workers, were also clear
Some of the missionaries from the China Inland Mission called a special meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation
In most cases, they would write and sign an official letter requesting their denomination to remove their names from the membership registry
Although this was not a regulation, the general practice was to write an official letter declaring one's decision to leave the denomination
In 1937 Brother Nee spoke further on how to maintain the Lord's testimony by establishing churches locality by locality
These messages were collected and published in Rethinking the Work, now published with the title The Normal Christian Church Life
The Lord has given us a special commission related to one church in one locality, the building, and the expression of the Body
The ground of locality and the building up of the Body of Christ are not simply matters that we minister; they are related to our testimony
They neither knew nor understood that God has commissioned us with the testimony of the local expression of the Body
From our manner of speaking and our attitude, he knew that we were clear concerning the truth and had a firm foundation
These elderly brothers felt that it was precious that young people like us were willing to forsake our future and live for the Lord
We wondered why those who had power in the gospel and those who were spiritual would not pay attention to the testimony of the church
We did not know what attitude we should have toward him, and the co-workers among us considered this to be a serious problem
We could fellowship with other believers on spiritual matters, receiving and sharing spiritual things with them
We should fellowship mutually in the gospel, in spiritual matters, and in the truth, but we could not compromise the church ground
At that time, there were many intellectuals among us; many brothers and sisters were working in the medical or educational fields
As a result, those who moved away from the war did not receive much supply, and the believers in territories occupied by the enemy were weak
We would insist on taking the ground of one locality for one church; we would hold on to the testimony of the Body of Christ
Our relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks was not based on the ground of the church; rather, it was based on spiritual matters
We were clear concerning the Lord's desire for us in the East; we also felt that we should receive a supply from other ministries
Even though other ministries might not have a clear ground, position, or background, they do have a portion in the spiritual ministry
The fact that she was in Catholicism should not be a reason for us to reject the spiritual supply from her portion
Even though we differ from Brother Austin-Sparks regarding the ground, this did not cause us to reject him or his spiritual supply
Since Brother Austin-Sparks' view differs from ours related to the ground, Brother Nee said that the time had not yet come to invite him
Brother Austin-Sparks should have maintained the attitude of ministering a spiritual supply and should not have touched the ground
In a meeting he openly said, 'You limit Christ to a locality and thus make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church'
Because she wanted to be with a group of Gods children whom she considered to be pleasing to Gods will and who were spiritual she chose us
Even if the leading ones among them turned away to love the world, they would still take this way, because this is the way the Lord desires
If the ground of denomination is right, we should not have another ground; we should all worship God in the denominations
Some cases involved individuals, and others involved a group; some took place in southern China and others, in northern China
Most of the ones who attempted to reconcile with the denominations eventually went the way of the denominations
We must realize that not only can they not help us, but also if we reconcile with them, they will influence us
If we would reconcile with them and be the same as they were, the enemy would applaud loudly because his scheme had succeeded
We are clear that if we have any result that is worthy of praise, it is because we have not reconciled with the denominations
If we allow others to take away our ground our teapot not only will the teapot they hate disappear but the tea they love will also vanish
It is not a matter of whether one has a good or a bad intention; we never doubted Brother Austin-Sparks' intention
Although Brother Austin-Sparks stands on a ground that is close to the local ground, he is not on the local ground
Even some who were in Catholicism, such as Madame Guyon and Brother Lawrence, were people with much spiritual weight and gifts
If they are willing to cooperate, there will be no problems; however, if they touch or destroy the ground, they will cause much trouble
If our brothers were all clear, there would not have been problems even though Brother Austin-Sparks had overstepped
May these attitudes no longer exist in the future when the brothers and sisters from the East and from the West come together to fellowship
Presently it is not a problem for the believers in the East to receive the spiritual help from those in the West
The believers in the West will need to be humble in order to receive spiritual supply from the believers in the East
May we be faithful to learn our lessons and labor in the Lord's work, and may we refrain from comparing ourselves with others
