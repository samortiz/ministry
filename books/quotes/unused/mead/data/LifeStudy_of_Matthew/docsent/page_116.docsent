   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Brought before Governors and Kings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as a Testimony for the Heavenly King s Sake</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 18 says, And you shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt this refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the Lord indicated that God s kingdom would be opposed not only by the Jewish religious world but also by the Gentile secular world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, the apostles were brought before the Roman governors and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were persecuted, and they became a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This reveals that both the religious world and the political world are the same in opposing the kingdom of the heavens, for both are under the usurping hand of God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The intention of the heavenly King is to establish His kingdom on earth within the territory of religion and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will certainly arouse opposition and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 19 and 20 the Lord said, But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostles have not only the authority of the heavenly King v. 1 , but also the Spirit of their heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The King s authority deals with the unclean spirits and diseases; the Father s Spirit deals with the opposers persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord was charging His sent ones not to speak from themselves whenever they met persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He seemed to be saying, Don t be anxious, and don t talk from yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit of your Father is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we have the Spirit of the Lord, we have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The presence of the Lord here is the Spirit for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should learn to face persecution not in ourselves, but learn to turn to our spirit and trust the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must believe that the Father s Spirit is with us and that He will deal with the opposers and persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not an easy thing to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must face opposition and confront attack, not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit of God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must trust in Him, let Him lead us, and let Him do the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>D. Hated by the Relatives</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord also told His sent ones that they would be hated by their relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 21 says, And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child, and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be the heavenly King s apostles for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, the sent ones must suffer the breaking of the closest human ties.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 22 the Lord continued, And you will be hated by all because of My name; but he who endures to the end, he shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be saved here does not mean to be saved from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may include being saved from those who hate, but eventually it means to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is to be saved from dispensational punishment during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This differs from eternal salvation as revealed in Ephesians 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>E. Fleeing from City to City</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 23 says, And when they persecute you in this city, flee into another; for truly I say to you, you shall by no means complete the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This word was not fulfilled by the twelve apostles preaching before Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It will not be fulfilled until the great tribulation 24:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is predicted in verses 17 through 23 is very similar to 24:9-13.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here the heavenly King sent the apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After His resurrection, He sent His apostles to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, He will send His apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the Jews again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time this word will be fulfilled, and He will come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>F. Not above Their Teacher</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 24 the King said to His sent ones, A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the context, the word here means that in suffering persecution His apostles cannot be above Him, because His persecution was to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 25 says, It is sufficient that he become as his teacher, and the slave as his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Beelzebub means the lord of the flies, the name of the god of the Ekronites 2 Kings 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means lord of the dunghill, and used for the ruler of the demons 12:24, 27; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15, 18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Pharisees, the leading ones of the Jewish religion, reviled the heavenly King by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of demons 9:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This most blasphemous name expressed their strongest contempt and rejection.</S>
