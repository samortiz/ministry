        <h2 class="head1">THE USE OF THE LIFE-STUDIES<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I am burdened concerning how we use the Life-studies in the home meetings. In the past some have selected a good speaker and charged him to read a Life-study several times and to remember all the crucial points of the message. On Sunday morning the speaker came to the platform to speak this message. Because this way has not always been so successful, some have changed their way. They asked all the saints to read the Life-study before coming to the meeting. In the meeting one or two would take the lead to have some read a paragraph at a time. After the reading of a paragraph there was the opportunity to speak if anyone was inspired. Eventually, this way was not successful either. So some tried to read selected portions of the Life-study in the meeting to see if there was an inspiration from the aggregate of several sections. This way also became a failure. Eventually nearly all the churches do not know how to use the Life-study messages in the meetings. They all know that diamonds, jewels, and jade are here in the Life-studies, but they do not know how to use them.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong those that sell diamonds are trained to be able to present a diamond from many angles. They can explain everything about a diamond in such a way that the customers are attracted, showing it to them from many angles, and explaining everything. With this explanation half of the listeners get attracted, asking &ldquo;How much? Let me see it.&rdquo; Those salesmen were trained. They surely know salesmanship. But we are not like this. We do not know how to show the angles of the diamond. We do not even know the difference between a diamond and jade. We have all the precious stones, yet we do not know how to use them. This has forced me to consider the situation. Sometimes I could not sleep so well at night just considering this matter of how to use the Life-studies.</p>
<p>We should use the Life-studies, but not in all those other ways. Forget about all those ways. We should use the Life-studies in the small meetings. Let the saints know that we are going to use a certain message of the Life-study as the very material for our speaking in the meeting. Then when we all come to the meeting, we will begin to read it. There are at least seven ways to read. First, you have to read in a short way. Just read a short portion. Sometimes you do not need to read a full sentence, because you may realize that a phrase or a clause is crucial. For instance, you may read, &ldquo;But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me&rdquo; (Gal. 1:15a, 16a). When you read this, you could surely realize that this is not a common word; this is too crucial. Therefore, you should not read ahead too quickly. You have to linger for a while: &ldquo;It pleased God to reveal His Son in me.&rdquo; When you pause, some others will repeat it. First, you read a short portion. Second, if that portion is crucial, repeat it. But do not repeat it in a formal way. We must repeat in a living way, not in a dead or formal way. This repeating-reading is very living, very meaningful, and very impressing. &ldquo;It pleased! It pleased God to reveal His Son in me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third way is to read with some explanation, but not with too much. Sometimes some wordings or terminologies in certain messages are not common. People just do not know the meaning of them. For instance, Matthew 1:21 says, &ldquo;You shall call His name Jesus.&rdquo; You may repeat, &ldquo;Jesus! Jesus!&rdquo; But nobody knows what Jesus means. You have the repetition, but there is the need of some explanation: &ldquo;Call His name Jesus. Call Him Jehovah the Savior.&rdquo; Read it in an explaining way. In your reading, you will give people the meaning. Sometimes you may feel this explanation is good and worthy of repetition. Then you would say, &ldquo;Jesus, Jehovah the Savior. Oh, Jehovah the Savior!&rdquo; This impresses people. This way requires a lot of learning. Therefore we all have to learn. Especially in this age, in the twentieth century, everything requires a lot of learning. To be a twentieth century believer in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, you cannot be too simple.</p>
<p>Another way is to pray-read. Sometimes when you have crucial verses, you have to pray-read them. When you read these verses, you realize that they are crucial and that they should be repeated. After one reads, right away you repeat. This is to pray-read. You also need to read with some variation in your voice, just like music. Sometimes the melody goes up and comes down. Sometimes it is faster; sometimes it is slower. Sometimes you have to read loudly, and sometimes you have to read not so loud. We have to learn this. We are not machines. We are not robots. We are very living. We know how to lift up our voice, and how to lower it down. We all have to learn the proper way. We have a sober mind and we have a spirit. We just exercise our spirit, and we know when is the time to utter something. We also know how long we should utter it and how much we should say.</p>
<p>To open up the home meetings may afford some who like to speak a good chance to occupy the entire time with their speaking. This is a real concern. I beg you all, for love&rsquo;s sake&mdash;we all love the Lord, we all love His Body, we all love His church&mdash;for the sake of this love, we all have to function properly. Do not occupy others&rsquo; time. Do not speak too long; do not speak too much; do not pray too long. We all have to learn this. Then we could practice using the Life-studies in a good way.</p>
<p>We can also pray-sing. When we read a verse, perhaps you will have a hymn or a chorus that just matches that thought. For instance, Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&rdquo; There is a hymn with just such a chorus, &ldquo;Christ lives in me, Christ lives in me.&rdquo; When you read, &ldquo;No longer I, but Christ lives in me,&rdquo; right away someone may take the lead to sing that chorus, &ldquo;Christ lives in me, Christ lives in me.&rdquo; This is why I call it pray-singing.</p>
<p>Then, there is another way to read: to read in order to apply, an applying-reading. You may read a verse, and apply this verse to your situation, to your present need. There are more ways of reading. It is not limited. We all have to be living, open, flexible, and adjustable. Let us all try and learn. We are all still in the learning stage. The best place for you to practice this learning is in the home meetings.</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a small home meeting in Taipei. At first I was disappointed. By the scheduled time of meeting there were only an old man, a small girl, and a young schoolteacher. Slowly others came in. Eventually a backsliding brother took the lead to speak a gospel hymn. A sister played the piano and all began to sing the hymn. Afterwards, the backsliding one gave an explanation of the whole hymn. By the end of the meeting I was very encouraged. This proves that the home meetings really work. They bring in the backsliders and make them the leaders. They bring in the people from the denominations and bring in the new converts. They bring in many different people, and eventually everybody feels happy. However, there is still one problem. Many still do not know how to use the Life-studies.</p>
<p>We need to use the Life-studies in order to enrich the home meetings, to strengthen the home meetings, to refresh, and to make them so alive, so attractive, even so attracting, and so upholding. I believe we will reach this goal. If we would endeavor, we will surely reach the goal, and the churches will all be built up. Once the churches are built up, the increase will surely come in. If we all begin to speak, the Lord will honor our speaking. Sooner or later, this one will be saved, that one will be saved; there will be some saved here and there. All these saved ones will be brought in. This is the way!</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
