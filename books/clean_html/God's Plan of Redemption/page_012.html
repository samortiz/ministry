<p>Another self-evident fact we will note. Each form of life has a definite goal which the invisible but inherent life-principle causes it to reach. In scientific phraseology this goal is the type to which it is to be conformed. Type, as used in this connection, may be defined as “the aggregate of characteristic qualities.” We see from what we have considered, how impossible it is for life on one plane to generate life on another plane. All that any life-principle can do is to bring to manifestation and maturity the life on that particular plane; e.g., the life-principle in the lily bulb will produce the lily life, and, if unhindered, will cause all the characteristics of that life to reach their perfection; but the life-principle in the lily can never produce bird life, nor can the life-principle in the egg of the bird do more than to cause the manifestation of the bird life. The bird life may reach its goal but it can go no higher. In other words, the bird may spread its wings and fly far up in the air; it may sing its sweetest song; but it can never generate human life. Human life, in turn, can only reproduce itself. It cannot generate life on a higher plane—the Uncreated Life of God.<p>We will now apply this law of heredity to Adam and Eve in their fallen condition. What are the characteristics of the life that they must reproduce? First, it is created (not self-existent) life; second, it is human life, not the Life of God; third, it is sinful, not sinless, life; therefore we may say that the children of Adam and Eve will come into the world with sinful, created, human life. The poison of sin is in the human germ, and it will be manifested with each unfolding life. It cannot be otherwise. It follows, then, that every descendant of Adam and Eve will enter the world with the same kind of life—i.e., sinful, created, human life. The words of the Apostle Paul in Romans 5:12 are fully in accord with this inflexible law of heredity: “Through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men for that all sinned.”<p>We must remember that we have found sin to be far more than an act, and we have seen the relation between sin and death; therefore the law of heredity and the “law of sin and death” run parallel throughout the world of human beings.<p>Before proceeding to another subject the teacher will do well to review what has already been presented in reference to sin. Have the pupils copy or commit to memory the following summary:<p class=indent1>Sin is an attitude of wilful, deliberate resistance to the authority of God. The manifestations of this attitude are sins.</p><p class=indent1>Sin originated with Satan ages before man was created. The immediate results of Satan’s sin were,<blockquote>(a) Banishment forever from the Presence of God.<br>(b) Loss of dominion.<br>(c) Bondage to fear.</blockquote></p><p>In reference to the last clause, explain that the awful words of judgment uttered by God to the first sinner cannot be forgotten by him. Satan remembers them well and he fears exceedingly; yet he is ever seeking to prevent the complete execution of the sentence of doom.<p class=indent1>The result of Satan’s sin in connection with the earthly sphere over which he had been given dominion, was a disordered, chaotic earth.</p><p class=indent1>Satan tempted Adam and Eve to sin.</p><p class=indent1>The immediate results of their sin were,<blockquote>(a) Death, i.e., separation from God—unresponsiveness to Him.<br>(b) Loss of dominion.<br>(c) Bondage to Satan.</blockquote></p><p class=indent1>The result of man’s sin in connection with the earthly creation over which God had given him dominion, is a disordered, suffering, dying condition in the human, animal and vegetable planes of life. (See Rom. 8:22.)</p><p>It will not be necessary at this time to enlarge upon the results of sin in connection with atmospheric and topographical changes, but we are justified in saying that sin has so changed and disfigured the earthly creation that we see its traces wherever we look. Not only in every human being, but in every member of the animal creation and in every bit of vegetation—we are forced to realize the results of man’s sin. The wonder is that with “earth’s king gone astray,” the earth has not again become “waste and wild.” But God has sustained because He had a purpose concerning the human race and a plan to be worked out in this sin-cursed world.<p>Let us now consider this great Eternal Purpose for the human race more in detail. Ask the class to read Romans 8:29-30 and Ephesians 1:3-5.
