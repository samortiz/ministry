   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"And do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What they say is really quite true: I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Indeed, they are marvelous before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have reason to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We acknowledge that there are many things in their midst of which they may boast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But it is better to leave this to the feeling of others and not to feel it ourselves; let others know about it, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would indeed be good if others say so; but if we say so, it is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Spiritual things must not be boasted of.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If one boasts of his riches concerning worldly things, the money will not fly away nor will the amount decrease; but spiritual things vanish away when you boast of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person says he is strong, then that strength is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The face of Moses shone, yet he himself was not aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whoever knows that his face is shining will lose the shining of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do not know you are growing, you are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are many who are so clear about their own condition, but on the contrary they have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have spiritual authority, that is all right, but if you know you have spiritual authority, that is not all right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Laodiceans are too clear in the estimate of themselves; they have too much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's eyes they are blind, poor, and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is why we must learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Laodicea is too clear regarding her richness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hope that we will grow, yet we do not want to know it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said, "You are wretched."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word "wretched" here is the same as the word "wretched" used by Paul in Romans 7:24.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is saying that they are just like Paul in Romans 7: On the spiritual side they are wretched, they are embarrassed, they are not like this and not like that, and in the Lord's eyes they are miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following this, the Lord points out three reasons why they are wretched and miserable: They are poor, they are blind, and they are naked.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning poverty, the Lord said, "I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich" Rev 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although they are rich in doctrines, the Lord sees them as still being poor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They must have living faith; otherwise, God's Word is useless to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their failure, their weakness, is due to the fact that their faith is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter says that gold proved by fire is faith on trial 1 Pet 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In days when the word given forth is poor, you must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the word increases, you must have faith that mingles with the words you have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must pass through all manner of trials so that the words which you have heard will be useful in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, you must buy gold tried in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must learn to trust even while in tribulation; then you will really be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, the Lord says, "And white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested" Rev 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have already mentioned that the "white garment" refers to behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The "white garment" here is the same as the white garment spoken of in several other places in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's purpose is that they should have no contamination, just as the garment is white.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God wants them to walk continuously before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is impossible to be naked before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Old Testament no man could approach God without being clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the priests went to the altar, their nakedness was not to be discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Corinthians 5:3 says, "If indeed, being clothed, we will not be found naked."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But here it is not a matter of being clothed or unclothed, but a matter of whether or not the garment is white.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus says, "And whoever gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward" Matt 10:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the white garment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may treat others with a feast, yet it may not be "white."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do it just for the sake of maintaining the glory of our group, that cannot be counted; if it springs from a motive that is even meaner than this, there is even a lesser reason for it to be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not clean enough.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord desires that we have a clean purpose and a clean motive to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are many activities and many motives in which we sense many impurities once we touch them; they are not white.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"That the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we walk before God, we should not be shameful.</S>
