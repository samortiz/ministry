   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Further, to maintain the Sunday morning preaching, you must have a good preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, a worker is not only needed to manage church affairs, but also to maintain the meetings for spiritual uplift.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is only natural, if a good address is to be delivered every Sunday, that the churches hope for someone who is better qualified to preach than recently converted local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could they be expected to produce a good sermon once a week?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And who could be expected to preach better than a specially called servant of God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So an apostle settles down to pastor the church, and consequently the churches and the work both lose their distinctive features.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result is serious loss in both directions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, the brethren become lazy and selfish because their thought is only centered on themselves and the help they can receive, and on the other hand, unevangelized territories are left without workers because apostles have settled down to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For lack of activity the spiritual growth of the churches is arrested, and for lack of apostles the extension of the work is arrested too.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since so much havoc has been wrought by introducing a feature of the work into the churches, and thus robbing both of their true nature, we must differentiate clearly between meetings that belong specifically to the work and those that belong specifically to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God blesses our efforts in any place to the salvation of souls, we must see to it that the saved ones understand, from the outset, that the meetings which resulted in their salvation belong to the work and not to the church, and that they are the church and must therefore have their own church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They must meet in their homes or in other places to pray, study the Word, break bread, and exercise their spiritual gifts; and in such meetings their object must be mutual helpfulness and mutual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each individual must bear his share of responsibility and pass on to the others what he himself has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The conduct of the meetings should be the burden of no one individual, but all the members should bear the burden together, and they should seek to help one another depending upon the teaching and leading of the Spirit, and depending upon His empowering too.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As soon as believers are saved, they should begin to assemble themselves regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such gatherings of local believers are true church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Meetings connected with the work are only a temporary institution unless the object is to maintain a special testimony in a special place .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the assembling of the believers for fellowship and mutual encouragement is something permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even should the believers be very immature, and their meetings seem quite childish, they must learn to content themselves with what help they receive from one another and must not always hope to be able to sit down and listen to a good sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should seek revelation, spiritual gifts, and utterance from God; and if their need casts them upon Him, it will result in the enrichment of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Meetings of recently saved believers will naturally bear the stamp of immaturity at the beginning, but for the worker to take over the responsibility of such meetings will stunt their growth, not foster it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the condition of the church meetings, not of the meetings connected with the work, that indicates the spiritual state of a church in any locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When an apostle is preaching a grand sermon, and all the believers are nodding assent and adding their frequent and fervent "Amens," how deeply spiritual the congregation seems!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is when they meet by themselves that their true spiritual state comes to light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The apostolic meeting is not an intrinsic part of the church life; it is merely a piece of work, and it ceases with the departure of the worker.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the church meetings go on uninterrupted, whether the worker is present or absent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is because the difference has not been realized between meetings for the church and for the work, that it has ever occurred to the brethren to cease to assemble themselves when the worker goes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One of the fruitful sources of spiritual failure today is that the children of God consider the church to be a part of the work; so when there is a sermon to hear, they constitute a willing audience, but if there is no preacher, the meetings automatically cease, and there is no thought of simply gathering together to help one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But how can the local believers be equipped to minister one to the other?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the apostolic days it was taken for granted that the Spirit would come upon all believers as soon as they turned to the Lord, and with the on-coming of the Spirit, spiritual gifts were imparted, through the exercise of which the churches were edified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The usual method which God has ordained for building up the churches is the ordinary church gatherings, not the meetings conducted by the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason the churches are so weak these days is that workers seek to build them up, through the meetings under their care, instead of leaving it to their own responsibility to edify each other through proper church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why has it come about that the church meetings of 1 Corinthians 14 are no longer a part of church life?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because so many of God's people lack the experience of the Spirit's on-coming, without which a meeting conducted along the lines of 1 Corinthians 14 is a mere empty form.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unless all those we lead to the Lord have a definite experience of the Holy Spirit coming upon them, it will be of little use instructing them how to conduct their church meetings, for such meetings will be powerless and ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Holy Spirit is upon the believers, as in the days of the early Church, He will give gifts to men, and such men will be able to strengthen the saints and to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We see from Paul's first Corinthian Epistle that God so equipped believers with spiritual gifts that they were able to carry on the work of building up the churches quite independently of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not imply that they needed no further apostolic help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They decidedly did.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Alas! that nowadays many of God's people set more store by God's servants than by His Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are content to be ministered to by the gifts of a worker, instead of seeking for themselves the gifts of the Spirit; so true church meetings have given place to meetings under the auspices of the workers.</S>
