<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Appreciating Being Created by God</H2><P>Verses 13 through 18 indicate that the psalmist appreciated being created by God. After speaking about God's creation, the psalmist declared, "How precious are Your thoughts to me, O God!/How great is the sum of them!/If I should count them, they would be more than the sand./When I awake, I am still with You" (vv. 17-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hating and Loathing<br>the Wickedness of the Wicked<br>according to the Principle of Good and Evil</H2><P>Verses 19 through 22 describe the psalmist's hating and loathing the wickedness of the wicked according to the principle of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Seeking to Be Led by God on the Eternal Way</H2><P>Finally, in verses 23 and 24 the psalmist asked God to search him and try him and then to lead him on the eternal way. He could write such an intimate word because he was close to God and intimate with Him.</P><P>I believe that the purpose of the arrangers in clustering these psalms together was to show that they were written by persons who were very intimate with God. When I read these psalms, I am comforted and I receive help in the matter of godliness. Like the writers of these psalms, I aspire to be one who is close to God, who is intimate with God, and who lives and walks not only in God's presence but even in God Himself.</P>
