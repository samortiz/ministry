   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He upholds the universe very easily.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not do anything He just speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He upholds all things by the word of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hebrews is a book on the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 11:3 we are told that the universe was framed according to the word of God, and in 1:3 we see that the universe is upheld by the word of power.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In God s redemption there are also three time periods.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Firstly, the Lord purified our sins in the past 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has not only atoned for our sins, but also made purification of them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Atoning means covering, but purification means that our sins have been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the type of the Old Testament, the atonement was only able to cover sins Psa 32:1 , but unable to take them away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So the atoning priests stood daily, offering the same sacrifices, and could never sit down Heb 10:11 .</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Son completed this work in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sitting at the Right Hand of God in the Present</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the Son doing now?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is sitting, resting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is enjoying some excellent sight-seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is sitting on the right hand of God, watching His lovers and seekers experience His purification of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is not doing anything there He is just sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At least five times the book of Hebrews tells us that the Lord Jesus is sitting 1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2 .</S>

   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In fact, you were washed before you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now the Lord has nothing more to do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is much better than the work of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Waiting for the Subduing of the Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>in the Future</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord is waiting for His enemies to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This will occur in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord lacks nothing except a footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He has the throne and the crown, but He does not yet have the footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He is only waiting for this.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Be assured that one day He will obtain this footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The book of Hebrews stresses the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting only for one thing that God will make His enemies a footstool for His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is sitting there in the heavens waiting for a footstool that He may have complete rest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the Old Testament God spoke in the prophets, in men moved by His Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the New Testament He speaks in the Son, in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Son is God Himself 1:8 , God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God the Father is hidden; God the Son is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>No one has ever seen God; the Son as the Word of God John 1:1; Rev 19:13 and the speaking of God has declared Him and has been His full expression, explanation, and definition John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Son is the center, the focus, of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the Godhead He is the effulgence of God s glory and the express image of God s substance.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In creation He is the means through whom the universe was made, the power that upholds all things, and the Heir appointed to inherit all things.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In redemption He has accomplished the purification of sins and is now sitting on the right hand of God in the heavens waiting for the subduing of His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The book of Hebrews reveals the contrast between the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Old Testament was of the law in letters and forms; of man, earthly, temporary; and by sight, issuing in a religion called Judaism.</S>
