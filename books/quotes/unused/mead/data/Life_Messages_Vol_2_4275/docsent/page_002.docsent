   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE VITAL POSITION OF GOD'S WORD IN HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to carry out His purpose, He has a way or an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's economy, that is, His way of achieving His eternal purpose, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are among those chosen by God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us consider the place of God's Word in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE BIBLE ALONE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to realize the importance of God's Word in His economy, we must understand that among the various religions on the earth, no book except the Bible can be called the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No religion has the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yes, the Moslems have the Koran, but that is largely an imitation of the Old Testament and a little part of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As for the writings of Hinduism and Buddhism, those writings are simply devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the whole earth the Bible stands alone as the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is logical and full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is practical, clear, inspiring, and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the word spoken by God and was ordained by Him to be put into a readable, understandable form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GRASPING THE ABSTRACT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because God is abstract and mysterious, it is hard to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Catholicism introduced images in an attempt to help people understand what would otherwise be hard to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God has not given us figures, like images or idols.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What He has given is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although He is mysterious, He makes Himself clear in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, the Spirit is mysterious and hard to grasp, but we do have the Word, which is solid, readable, and understandable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The black and white word is also accurate; it leaves little room for argument.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose since Pentecost there had been no Bible among the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What would there be on earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may say, Don't we have the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yes, we do, but without the Bible the Spirit would be a delusion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The period when the Bible was locked up by the Catholic Church was the darkest age in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Martin Luther not only recovered justification by faith; it was he who unlocked and released the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Four hundred years ago the Bible became a freed book.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the Word of God which has kept the things of God on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan today subtly tries to keep people from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christians may have a Bible on their bookshelf at home, or once a week they may have it in their hands, but when they open its pages, very little light can they see.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most Christians today are in darkness because they do not read and understand the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Triune God is revealed in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has created the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has been incarnated and has passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The all-inclusive death of Christ, His resurrection, and ascension have all been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these things our God has passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is nothing left undone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In eternity past our God was without creation and without incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But now the universe has been created.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even more, the very Creator has entered into His creatures through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has experienced human living; He has been to the cross and died there; He has entered into resurrection; and He has even ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now He has returned to the earth as the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the very God whom we worship and whom we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But these matters are abstract; how can we grasp them?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord knows our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore He has spoken and has had His word written down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now this book is in our hand.</S>
