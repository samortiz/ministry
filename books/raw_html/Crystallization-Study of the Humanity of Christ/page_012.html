<P>In this message we want to see more concerning the revelation of Christ as a man in the Old Testament prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Being like a Refuge, a Covering,<br>Streams of Water, and the Shadow of a Massive Rock</H2><P>Isaiah prophesied that Christ, as a man in His humanity, would be like a refuge from the wind and a covering from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land, and at the same time He would reign according to righteousness as the King, under whom there would be righteousness, protection, and enjoyment, in the millennium (Isa. 32:1-8). A tempest is a violent windstorm frequently accompanied by rain, snow, or hail. Christ is not only a refuge from the wind but also a covering from the tempest. Although this prophecy will be fulfilled in the millennium, we need to realize that today the church life is a minor millennium. In this minor millennium, we can enjoy Christ as the reality of so many rich items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. A Man of Sorrows</H2><P>Isaiah 53 unveils that Christ was a man of sorrows (v. 3) in His humanity to be our Redeemer in detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Sitting on the Throne of God</H2><P>Ezekiel saw Christ, as a man in His humanity, sitting on the throne of God above the firmament (1:26-28). Satan's realm is in the air, the firmament, but Christ as a man in His humanity is sitting on the throne that is in the third heaven, above the territory of Satan. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #132 says:</P><blockquote>Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,<br>Christ the Lord is there enthroned;<br>As the man by God exalted,<br>With God's glory He is crowned.</blockquote><P>According to history Christ's sitting on the throne should be after His death, resurrection, and ascension. But in the Old Testament Ezekiel saw Him sitting on the throne. This is similar to the apostle John's experience. He saw the New Jerusalem, but the New Jerusalem to him and to us is not yet.</P><P>The entire Bible needs our study so that we may have the proper interpretation of the Bible. The Bible was first written, later translated, and then interpreted. The many different truths in the Bible can be likened to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In our study of the Bible, we have endeavored to put together all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. Today I believe that I have finished the work of putting the pieces of the entire Bible together. When all the pieces are put together properly, we can see a clear view.</P>
