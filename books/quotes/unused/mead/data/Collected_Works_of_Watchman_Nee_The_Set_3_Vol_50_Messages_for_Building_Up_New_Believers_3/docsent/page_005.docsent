   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Not Having the Element of Chance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Recreation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fourth, all recreation must involve skill.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It must not involve games of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may say that the only kind of recreation that is proper is that which involves pure skill and nothing of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any recreation that involves both skill and chance is a kind of gambling, not recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If an activity involves only chance and has nothing to do with skill, it is gambling, and Christians should turn away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything that involves chance is a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christian recreation should involve only skill; it should not have any element of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A game of dice is altogether a matter of chance; a Christian should never engage in this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is altogether gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Young people can play chess, because chess is a matter of skill, not a game of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two kinds of recreation: One involves skill, and the other involves chance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A game of dice involves one's luck.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, it is a game of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Christian must not engage in any kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some love to play mahjong before they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It involves a little skill plus a good element of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian can play only with skill, not with anything that involves chance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot even have games that depend partly on skill and partly on chance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mahjong is a game of chance, even when it does not involve any money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It gives the player a kind of hope, a kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He hopes that chance will be on his side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of hope is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mahjong is wrong even when no betting is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Billiards involve skill.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though there are wins and losses, there is nothing wrong with the game itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, when money is involved, it is wrong; it becomes a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can say that some games are a kind of gambling in themselves, while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, one can take a game that does not involve gambling and turn it into a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even something as harmless as a meal can become a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Throwing dice is a gambling game in itself, even though money is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Christian should not engage in this kind of game.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As Christians, we have principles that govern our judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we say that we can do something or we cannot do certain things, we are guided by principles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is right to play a game that involves skill, and it is wrong to play something that involves chance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any kind of game that involves skill is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But any game that depends on chance is not permissible; it is a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, we should not touch anything that the world would consider a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must have our principles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must find out what gambling is and what games of chance are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything that involves chance is gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some brothers ask whether hunting, fishing, and keeping birds is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible, hunting began from Nimrod Gen 10:8-9 , and the Lord did not seem to like it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fishing is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once you are clear about the principle, you will know what to do with many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In conclusion, it is right if it involves skill only, and it is wrong if chance is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Gambling is completely out of the question.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One would have to be very fallen to ask whether it is permissible for a Christian to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some birds can be kept because they have been domesticated for years and are like house pets; they would not live if they were freed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we must free those that can survive by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are domestic pigeons as well as wild pigeons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can apply the same principles to these matters.</S>
