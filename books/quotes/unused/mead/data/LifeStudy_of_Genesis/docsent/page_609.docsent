   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S OPERATION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With this message we conclude the series of messages on chapter forty-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter forty-nine is a record of Jacob's prophetic blessing of his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These blessings are given in figures, signs, and symbols, all of which need to be allegorized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that in Genesis the seeds of nearly all the truths in the Bible are sown.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seeds sown in this book are developed in the following books and are harvested in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because Genesis is a book of the seeds of the truths contained in the Bible, the conclusion of chapter forty-nine must correspond to the conclusion of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the last two chapters of Revelation there are two main things: the universal blessing and the eternal dwelling of God with men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we consider this universal blessing and the eternal dwelling, we need to review chapter forty-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first four sons of Jacob were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the record of the Old Testament, these four sons were evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first and the fourth, Reuben and Judah, were full of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second and the third, Simeon and Levi, were full of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lust and anger characterize evil people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens decreed in Matthew chapters five, six, and seven, the Lord Jesus covered lust and anger in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a man can be kept from these two things, he will not be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man becomes sinful mostly because he is full of lust and anger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We praise the Lord that in His grace He saved the first four sons of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, two of them were transformed into something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Levi was transformed to become the priests, and Judah was transformed to become the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sinners have become priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This has been accomplished by a kingly salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This salvation was sent out to the Gentile world by Zebulun, the fifth son of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the gospel was shipped out by Zebulun, Issachar came in as rest, rest in the gospel accomplished by Judah and preached by Zebulun.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The saved one rests in God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After Issachar came Dan and with him a form of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Dan deviated from God's way, Gad came in to restore the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, with Dan we have apostasy, and with Gad we have recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The recovery with Gad issues in the sufficiency of the riches of Christ symbolized by Asher.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Naphtali, who follows Asher, signifies resurrection in which are the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the first ten sons, we come to the last two, Joseph and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you read the record of these two sons carefully, you will see that there is no account of any defect or failure in them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although there is a long record regarding Joseph in the Bible, there is no hint that he was wrong in anything or that he failed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joseph was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we cannot say that Benjamin was perfect, there is no record of any defect in his life either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Joseph was called the son of a fruitful tree, and Benjamin, the son at the right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is very meaningful that Joseph was fruitful and that Benjamin was at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two characteristics can easily be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the only Son of the fruitful tree, and He is also the only Son at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, both Joseph and Benjamin were types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Joseph was a type of Christ issuing in God's unlimited, boundless, universal blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The perfect Christ typified by Joseph brought in God's boundless blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Benjamin was a type of Christ as the One who brought in God's eternal dwelling place.</S>
