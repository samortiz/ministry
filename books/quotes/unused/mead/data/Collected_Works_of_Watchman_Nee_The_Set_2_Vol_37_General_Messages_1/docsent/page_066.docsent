   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Ark in the House of Obededom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After twenty years, David was raised up as king.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once he came to the throne, he ordered that the ark be taken to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Chronicles 13:1-3 says, "And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader...let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was right and good for David to try to bring the ark to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what did they do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart....And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals" 2 Sam 6:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the midst of such rejoicing, something tragic unexpectedly happened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God....And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So David would not remove the ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his household" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather than investigating the reason that the oxen were shaken, David rejected the ark from the city of David just because Uzzah was smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet the house of Obededom welcomed the ark, and his household was blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, are we going to forsake the Lord's presence as soon as we suffer God's dealings?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or are we going to welcome His presence like the household of Obededom?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David was wrong because He intended to move the ark of God to Jerusalem and discussed it with the captains of thousands and hundreds, but he did not search into the law for the proper way to move the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Numbers 4:4-15, the ark was to be carried by the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God did not order the ark to be drawn by a cart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cart with the oxen was a method copied from the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God did not blame the Philistines for their ignorance, but He would not allow David to ignore God's command and follow the way of the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows us that any zeal for God that is according to a new method not found in the Bible or according to a novel way apart from God's will can never last and will eventually bring in disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the beginning, the playing was exciting, and many people were there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after a while, everything stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God takes no pleasure in temporary excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will not allow the flesh to touch anything that He has ordained for individuals as well as for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will not allow man to alter any of His arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Uzzah probably put forth his hand to stop the ark of God from falling because he loved the ark and was zealous for it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God was not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not allow Uzzah to touch the ark with his fleshly hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, God did not allow man to uphold errors with fleshly hands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps you think that your idea is better than God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God will not allow you to change anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can only work according to God's design.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, you will see nothing except God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps some will say that many people in the church are replacing God's will with fleshly ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why is it that God has not judged them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must say with fear and trembling that it is either because the time has not come or because the ark has left them!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not despise God just because of His forbearance and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Ark in David's Tent</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>David did not know why God smote Uzzah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was afraid to move the ark to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet while the ark was in the house of Obededom, God blessed Obededom and his household.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When someone told David about this, he happily moved the ark of God from the house of Obededom to the city of David 2 Sam 6:12; 1 Chron 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This time it was different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In his preparation David ordered: "None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever" 1 Chron 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the past, he thought he could do what the Philistines did.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now he knew that God's service had to be done according to God's pattern and not according to man's pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now the Levites carried the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result, "They brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord" 16:1-2 .</S>
