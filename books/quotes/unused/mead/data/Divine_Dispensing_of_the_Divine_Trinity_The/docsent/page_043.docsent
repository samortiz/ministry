   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPRESSION, THE ACCOMPLISHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression, the accomplisher John 1:18; Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The source and the expression are not two things, but one thing with two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It has the aspect of the source and the aspect of the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Father as the source is the initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He initiated all things, including the planning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son, as the expression, is the accomplisher.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever the Father planned, the Son accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So the Son is the accomplisher.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>COMING IN THE FATHER S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son was sent by the Father, and He came in the Father s name John 5:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By reading the Gospel of John you could see that the Lord Jesus never did anything in His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He always did everything in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This point is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me illustrate it in this way: as a husband, you like to be a good husband.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely you have made up your mind to be a good husband.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But let me ask: When you made up your mind to be a good husband, did you do it in the name of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In whose name did you make up your mind?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Probably you would have to say in your own name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we have been redeemed, and regenerated, and even though we may love the Lord very much, yet we do nearly everything in our own name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do very few things in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes at the end of our prayer we may say, In the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some have said that we are not qualified to pray, so we should not sign our name at the end of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They say this is like putting your signature on a check, but having no deposit in the bank under this name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So the check can never be honored.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You had better put the signature of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the heavenly bank sees this check, it will honor it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So at the end of every prayer, we should say, In the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No, it doesn t mean that.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does it mean?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul said, I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means Paul lived in the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is like Christ not coming in His own name, but in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was the Son, yet He came not in the Son s name, but in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The name Christian was given by outsiders in ancient times as a kind of nickname because the early saints lived, not in their own name, but in the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, they did not live themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So in the eyes of the outsiders, they were Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They were Christ-men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christian simply means a Christ-man, a man who lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Son came He did not simply represent the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He came, the Father came John 6:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He came in the Father s name; He lived the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is just for the Father s dispensing in the Son and through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you have the Son, you have the Father, because the Father came in the Son s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Son brought the Father to His believers, it was for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>TO TABERNACLE AMONG THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This wonderful One came to tabernacle among men John 1:14; 16:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The tabernacle, of course, is a figure of speech, and to understand it, you have to study the tabernacle in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Exodus there was a tabernacle which typified God incarnated in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The building elements in the tabernacle acacia wood overlaid with gold show humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Wood signifies humanity, and gold signifies divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the tabernacle divinity is joined to humanity, and humanity is overlaid with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tabernacle signifies God in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This very God as the tabernacle is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When God remains in His divinity, He is not approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In His divinity, He dwells in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But He became incarnated in the flesh, and this incarnate God in the flesh becomes the enterable tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the ancient days, the priests could enter into the tabernacle, which was a type of God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So the incarnated God, the very divinity in humanity, now becomes enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His redeemed people, His priests, His serving ones, can enter into Him and dwell in Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Son of God came not just to dwell among us, but to tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If He had come only to dwell among us, we could never enter into Him to dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But He came to tabernacle among us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He becomes our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What, or who, is the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Chapter one of John says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here is one entity, the tabernacle, that signifies the Word, the Triune God, and the Triune God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This One is full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the dispensing of the Trinity, first in the Father, and then in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The tabernacle signifies not only the Son, but also the very Triune God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Gospel of John, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, but they are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Why are they not separate?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is because the Son, when He was sent by the Father, came with the Father John 6:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He not only came with the Father, but He also said that He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him John 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Father sent the Son, and the Son came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Otherwise, the Son could never have been the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Son had to be all-inclusive so that He could be the tabernacle, the enterable God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I know that this kind of expression, the enterable God, is new to you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have heard of the almighty God and the omnipresent God, but you probably have never heard of the enterable God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Just to know that He is almighty and omnipresent does not mean so much, but to know that He is enterable means a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>By tabernacling among us, our God became enterable.</S>
