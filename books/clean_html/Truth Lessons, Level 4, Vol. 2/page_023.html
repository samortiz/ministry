<p>In this lesson we will consider Moses&rsquo; prophecy with blessing concerning the tribes of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. MOSES&rsquo; PROPHECY WITH BLESSING<br />
CONCERNING THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 33 speaks of the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death. Many important prophecies are in these blessings. The tribe of Simeon did not receive a blessing from Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Concerning Reuben</h2>
<p>Moses&rsquo; prophecy concerning Reuben in Deuteronomy 33:6 says, &ldquo;May Reuben live and not die, / Nor his men be few.&rdquo; This word implies that Reuben should have died because of his sin (Ezek. 18:20). Even though Reuben should have died, Moses was merciful in executing the judgment of the law. He was concerned that Reuben would die and that the number of his tribe would be greatly decreased.</p>
<p>As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben should have received the birthright, but he sinned and lost the birthright. Because of his sin, the tribe of Reuben was nearly reduced to nothing. Moses, however, was merciful and prayed that Reuben would live and not die and that his men would not be few. This means that Reuben received the blessing of increase.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Concerning Judah</h2>
<p>In Deuteronomy 33:7, concerning Judah, Moses said, &ldquo;Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, / And bring him to his people.&rdquo; This was a prayer for Judah, a tribe accustomed to fighting for the people, to be brought back from the battlefield. In verse 7 Moses also said that with his hands Judah contended for his people. Caleb and David are among those who contended in this way. Finally, Moses prayed that Jehovah would help Judah to fight against his adversaries. In fulfillment of this prophecy, Jehovah helped David in defeating the enemies around him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Concerning Levi</h2>
<p>Moses&rsquo; blessing concerning Levi in verses 8 through 11 is very rich.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Receiving Jehovah&rsquo;s Thummim and Urim</h2>
<p>Moses said that Jehovah&rsquo;s Thummim and Urim would be with His faithful men, with whom He contended at the waters of Meribah. Concerning his father and mother, Levi said, &ldquo;I do not regard him,&rdquo; and he did not acknowledge his brothers nor recognize his children. Levi kept Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking and guarded His covenant (vv. 8-9). This indicates that Levi cared for God&rsquo;s interests instead of for his relatives.</p>
