<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Making Us an Inheritance of God</H2><P>When He redeemed us, He also made us an inheritance of God for God's enjoyment (vv. 11-12). We are one with Christ in His divine life to be God's inheritance so that God can enjoy us as His enjoyment. This is the result of the dispensing of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Sealing Us as God's Inheritance</H2><P>Ephesians 1 goes on to tell us that the Holy Spirit sealed us as God's inheritance for His enjoyment (v. 13). The Holy Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. God the Father is embodied in God the Son (John 14:10; Col. 2:9), and God the Son is realized as God the Spirit (John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). The Spirit of God is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us to dispense all that God is and has into our being. To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. When a piece of paper is sealed with ink, the seal, the ink, and the paper all become one. The ink in the form of the seal will be absorbed by the paper, and they will be mingled and blended together as one entity. The paper is now a sealed paper, a paper with a seal. Before we received the Lord, we were blank sheets of paper. After Christ's redemption, we were cleansed and the consummated Spirit of God came to seal us with the very element and essence of the Triune God as the ink. Now in this universe there is a group of people who have been sealed by the consummated Spirit of the Triune God. We sealed ones are one entity with the entire Triune God. This is the dispensing of the divine Trinity in all the divine elements into God's chosen people redeemed by Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being a Pledge to Us of God as Our Inheritance</H2><P>The sealing Spirit is also a pledge to us of God as our inheritance for our enjoyment (Eph. 1:14). God has not only gained us, acquired us, as an inheritance, but He has also given Himself to us as our possession, as our inheritance, for our enjoyment. On the one hand, we are God's acquired possession, God's inheritance, for His enjoyment. On the other hand, God is a possession to us as our inheritance for our enjoyment. Again, this shows us that we redeemed ones and the Triune God, the redeeming One, become one entity through His divine dispensing of His divine essence and element into our very being.</P>
