   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Q. The Present Churches Being Old</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Filled with Problems</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The opposers also have said that the present churches are old and full of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see that the churches mentioned in the New Testament all had problems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in Jerusalem was a young church, but it also had the problem of Ananias and Sapphira Acts 5:1-11 and the problem concerning the distribution of food to the widows 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One does not need to be old to have troubles or to become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The elders who take care of the churches have to deal with problems continually.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as you are a living, organic person, each day there is the possibility of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Epistles in the New Testament were written to churches with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If these churches had not had any problems, we would not have these New Testament Epistles today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Lord, because the churches had problems in the early days, we have the New Testament Epistles which have become a great help to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians is a long Epistle of sixteen chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every chapter deals with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Corinthians 11:34, after dealing with a number of problems, Paul said, "And the rest I will set in order when I come."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this Paul was saying, "In this Epistle I addressed eleven of your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But there are still a number of other problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I cannot cover them now, but I will when I come."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was in the church in Chefoo in 1932 at the beginning of the Lord's recovery in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Basically we knew only that we had to leave the denominations and meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We did not have our own hymnal, and we did not know how to choose a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We did not know the proper way to have the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also did not know how to praise the Lord in a high way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, however, our practice, our praises, and our hymns are higher.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The churches today are much higher than they were sixty or even thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>R. Reality versus the Doctrine and</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Systematized Teaching of Brother Lee</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The dissenting ones have said that reality is versus the doctrine and systematized teaching of Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To their opinion, I have been teaching too much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have condemned my teaching, my training, and my conferences because they said that these are the means for me to control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, my teaching does not control anyone, but it does regulate us, including me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One brother in the past pointed out that if a speaker cannot speak something higher than himself, he is a poor speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must learn to teach and preach things which are higher than what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our reality can never match our revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Did Paul's reality match his revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did Paul's experiences come up to his revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus Himself is the only one whose reality fully matched His teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apart from Him, no one on this earth can have the real experience to fully match his own teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The dissenting ones have also said that my teachings are systematized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have never taught anything in a system.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>S. The Church of the Saints Democracy</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1988 the dissenting ones claimed that there should be democracy among us since the church is the church of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament with Israel and in the New Testament with the believers, the government among God's people is neither democracy nor autocracy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is theocracy, which is government by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Democracy is better than autocracy in the political realm, but among God's people, neither of these ways should have any place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's people should have only theocracy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Theos God is our Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is living, and today He is the all-inclusive Spirit within us and among us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to learn to listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church should be under God's ruling.</S>
