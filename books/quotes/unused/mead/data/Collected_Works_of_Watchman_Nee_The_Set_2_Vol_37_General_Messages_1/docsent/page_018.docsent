   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TESTIFYING WITHOUT EXHIBITING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then should we not bear testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, we should.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul did so, and multitudes of God's children from generation to generation have done so too.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But bearing testimony is one thing; delighting in exhibiting one's experience is quite another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is our object in testifying?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is it that others may profit or that we may have the pleasure of talking?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The love of hearing one's own voice and the desire to be helpful to others are two totally different things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We testify because there is a problem, and we have to speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A testimony is not an after meal conversation piece.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times while we gossip, spiritual riches leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord so leads, we should testify because we want to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul testified in 2 Corinthians 12, but he did not lightly disclose his experience fourteen years earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He hid his experience for fourteen years, and no one knew about it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even when he talked about this experience, he did not disclose everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He only mentioned the experience; he did not relate the whole story.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He only mentioned the fact that he received a revelation and heard unspeakable words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not tell others the words that he heard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even today, the third heaven is still a mystery, and we still do not know what it is like.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, what are our treasures?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What are our gold, silver, spices, precious ointments, and precious things?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is our armory?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to remember that gold is everything that is of God and silver is anything that is related to the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spices are the results of our wounds, precious things are the things that relate to the kingdom, and armory is the Lord's work that we have received from God and from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these are not doctrines, biblical teachings, or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are the things we have acquired through our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we fellowship with God, communicate with Him, and are dealt with by Him, we pick up many things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is wrong to speak about them loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This does not mean that we should not testify.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we must realize that many experiences need to be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, this is a crucial matter in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many spiritual experiences need to be hidden away and should not be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus sometimes gave His testimony, but He was never talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is one thing to give a testimony and another thing to be talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord healed the sick and insisted that the story of the healing be kept secret.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This charge is repeated again and again in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once the Lord told a certain person, "Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you" 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may speak of the great things the Lord has done for us, but we must not publish these things abroad as items of news; this only exposes ourselves as being without any root.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be without root is to be without any treasure; it is to be without any hidden life or hidden experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is essential that some of our experiences remain covered; to uncover everything is to lose everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us also remember that if we display all our treasure, captivity cannot be averted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Death and exposure go together, and spiritual dryness and exposure also go together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if we have to give a testimony, we must be like Paul, who boasted out of necessity "though indeed not expedient" 2 Cor 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan's attack often comes at the time a man is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Any kind of exposure opens us up to loss.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people are healed of their sickness, and they testify for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But many testimonies of healing are not for the glory of God but for the glory of one's own faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result, the sickness comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After these ones give their testimony once, they are attacked by the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows us that God covers those who cover their roots, and God does not protect those who disclose their roots; they will be exposed to attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If God wants us to testify, we still have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But there are many things that ought to be hidden away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God protects what we hide before Him, and we enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The same applies to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By His grace and mercy God has accomplished something through us, but remember that what He has accomplished is not a matter for advertisement or material for propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we expose the work of God, we will find that the touch of death comes upon it immediately; and the loss will correspond to the extent to which we expose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As soon as David numbered the children of Israel, death set in 2 Sam 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May God deliver us from this kind of exposure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whatever secrets we have with the Lord must be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can only move according to God's instruction within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only if He moves within us to reveal something, dare we reveal it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If He wants us to share some experience with a brother, we dare not withhold it, for that would be violating a law of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One law of the members of the Body of Christ is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once we suppress this law, the flow stops.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be positive, not negative, and minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if we are engrossed all day with ourselves and with our own things, this talkativeness and exposure opens us to assault from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I trust we shall learn what the Body of Christ is and what the flow of life among the members is; but I trust we shall also learn the need for safeguarding the hidden part we have before the Lord, the experiences which are not known to others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No root should be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we extend ourselves deeper and take root downward, we will discover that "deep calls unto deep."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we can bring forth riches from the depths of our inner life, we will find that other lives will be deeply affected.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The minute our inner being is touched, others will receive help and be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They will know that there is something beyond their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When deep touches deep, deep will respond to deep.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If our life has no depth, our superficial work will only affect other lives superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We repeat yet again only "deep calls unto deep."</S>
