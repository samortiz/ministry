<h2 class="head2">Tsaoyang, Hupei Province</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have not heard any news about you for a long time. I am very concerned about you! Brother Mu Hwei-chen passed through Hankow on his way to Kweilin. Have you seen him? By the Lord's grace, we not only got to see each other in Honan, but also had the opportunity to pray together in one accord. We also had a time of prayer together before we left Honan. We really did not want to leave. Do you have any news of where the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao and Chefoo moved to? Are you clear about where the Lord wants you to work? I hope to hear from you. I received a letter from Sister Chin in Peking saying that Brother Witness plans to go to Peking. She also said that Sister Chi's husband (Chi Tsung-sin) was saved. Oh, may the doors to the Lord's gospel be opened wide. We left Shansi province and came to Honan. Not long afterwards, we continued on our way to Tsao-Yang County, where we are living temporarily. My elder brother sent a telegram telling me to go to Ch'ang-sha and then to go home (Tientsin) together with my younger brother. Please pray for this matter! My eldest sister is in Wuhu, and we do not have any news of her. The same is true of my uncle. May the Lord grace you and the brothers and sisters who are with you, amen. Grace be with you. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me. Sister Yi-rong sends her greetings.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Wu Deh-shin<br />January 13</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received the letter that you sent in care of Mrs. Kwan. Thank you. Thank and praise the Lord. Sister Dai, Sister Chang, and Sister Shao are all in Tientsin, and they all come to the meetings. I have also witnessed God's work recently in the brothers and sisters. God is doing His own work through the present environment. The spiritual growth of several brothers is something that I must praise the Lord for. The brothers and sisters receive much help from them in both the Bible studies and the gospel meetings. Thank the Lord for gracing us! We are still remembering the physically weak ones in our prayers. We also mention Brother Luan. May God grace him. If God wills, He will cause him to become healthy; if not, may the Lord manifest His great power in man's weakness as He did in the apostle Paul. Brother Yin went to Ch'ang-sha about three months ago. The Lord is still using him there. Mrs. Yin will come north to stay for awhile. Please remember Sister Chang Hsiu-fong when you pray. The illness she contracted after childbirth cannot be healed easily. May the Lord be merciful to her and heal her. Thank the Lord, His grace to me is greater than what I am worthy of. I am "cold" so many times, but the Lord repeatedly draws me with His love. My heart cannot but be drawn towards Him. It is true that the Lord's love is deeper as time goes by, and His grace is greater as the years go by. Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord and the ones that I know: Brother Nee, Brother Luan, and Sister Chang. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Lin Chang Pin-jeng<br />December 20, 1937</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>Peace to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have received the twenty copies of The Open Door which you sent. Yesterday, I received thirty copies that were sent from Hong Kong. This is just enough to distribute to the brothers and sisters. It is a great comfort to learn of the news of all the localities and to know the condition of each of the churches from The Open Door. The meetings here are continuing as usual. Although the brothers have not grown in life much, they have finally learned to live by the Lord's grace and allow grace to carry them through. This is really something to thank and praise the Lord for! Brother James Chen came to Swatow last month. After holding a two-week Bible study, he and some of the brothers went to Yi-Yang to preach the gospel. I have heard that Satan worked mightily to try to close the door of the gospel. But if the Lord has opened the door of the gospel, who can close it? The brothers left a good impression, and they are prepared to go out a second time. We really thank and praise the Lord for this! They all came back today. They will rest for three or five days, and then they will go out again. Please remember them in prayer. Please send us The Open Door as it is published. I am sending you an order form and am wiring X dollars through the post office for printing costs. Please tell me when you have received it. Rejoice in the Lord!</p><p>Representing the brothers of the assembly in the Lord's name in Swatow,<br />Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tze-shun, Zan Tsao-hua<br />January 10</p>
