   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The real significance of the pope is in the papal system, and the real control of the saints is in the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What the Lord wants in the new way is for us to leave the papal system and the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To remain in these systems is to be a Nicolaitan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Nicolaitans are mentioned in Revelation 2:6 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the meaning in Greek, this group of people are those who climb above the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are a group of people who esteem themselves, the clergy, higher than the common believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Revelation 2:6 and 15, the Lord hates the works of the Nicolaitans with their teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The works and teaching of the Nicolaitans are prevailing in both Catholicism and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The system of one man speaking and the rest listening is a part of the papal and clergy-laity systems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we remain in this realm, we are Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Nicolaitans are those who put down the Body of Christ and annul the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Catholicism and Protestantism build up a religion to replace and put down the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spontaneously, they kill and annul all the members of the Body of Christ by depending on a class of people called the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unconsciously, much of what we do may be in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is the Body of Christ and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not normal for only a small number of the members of a person's body to function while all the rest are paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A normal man uses all of his physical members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to consider today's situation in Christianity, in Catholicism and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where is such a corporate man, comprising the living, active, functioning members of the Body of Christ to fulfill the purpose of God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mostly what is considered in Christianity is the work of gaining sinners, winning souls, to build up a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That is not for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our concept has been captured by that practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We left Babylon, but Babylon's principle and philosophy still remain with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We left Babylon, but the Babylonian system would not leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the new way, the God-ordained way?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The God-ordained way is to rescue us from this Babylonian capture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have been captured by the philosophy of the papal and clergy-laity systems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are still carrying, probably unintentionally and subconsciously, the philosophy of these systems with us in whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why I say that we have to endeavor to change our philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not building up any kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are building up the Body of Christ, and we are building up the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should be perfecting all the members of the Body and equipping all the parts of the new man, but we do not do much perfecting or equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In actuality we left Babylon, but the Babylonian philosophy still goes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unconsciously, we still like to keep this philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is the need of a revolutionary change from this old philosophy to the new, scriptural principle.</S>
