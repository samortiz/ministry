   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have covered some conditions related to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now for the sake of the weakness of God's children, we will say a few more words.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most of the time, the prompting of the Holy Spirit gives us an assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that when we are about to do something, God will give us the assurance that what we are about to do is according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of assurance comes in a calm way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He gives us this assurance, He will put a calm peace in our heart and refresh our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of assurance should be maintained by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is faith to maintain it, we will see this assurance always abiding; it will not change through time and place, and we will not doubt if this is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the initial stage of our Christian life, we should always remember that the prompting of the Holy Spirit is powerful, yet calm; it is gradual, yet never compelling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It always waits for the consent of our own will; it waits for us to act on our own and never oppresses or overrules us by some kind of force.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must also always remember that the prompting of the Holy Spirit operates from within; it works from the center to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It works within the spirit and then enlightens the mind, so that the mind understands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only after we have given our consent, will it work itself out through our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soulish stirring is a work of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes, for no reason at all, we feel very happy and elated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At such times, we may have many plans to do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, the power in our emotion seems to be very strong, as if we cannot rest until we finish what we have resolved to do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we want to distinguish between the stirring of the soul and the prompting of the Holy Spirit, we have to remember a few things: the stirring in the soul is mainly caused by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes when we are alone, we feel like sighing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Soulish stirrings cause us to have sudden feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is as if a power within us is trying to subjugate us and dominate us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not calm; there is a kind of burning and confused urge within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we stop immediately and wait for the emotional stirring to subside, we will find that what we considered as the Spirit's prompting and what we considered as a necessary thing to do was not according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One thing we know: what we "feel" to do when we are stirred up is merely an impression we have in our feelings; it does not result in any assurance on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is patient; He is not hasty to accomplish what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why He spoke through the prophet Isaiah, "He who believes will not hasten away" Isa 28:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, He takes time to prompt us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nine times out of ten, sudden feelings are not His will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Impulses from Satan are in reality very different from the prompting of the Holy Spirit; the two are actually opposite each other.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Outwardly, it is difficult for believers to differentiate between the two because Satan will not cause us to completely fall into sin; he will only turn us away from God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes he holds us back so that we fall short; at other times, he urges us on, so that we become too much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He disguises himself as the angel of light and speaks to our ears, confusing the small voice of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's children should be experienced in distinguishing the suggestions of Satan from the revelations of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan's impulses always come suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His way with Christians is to come in the way of a blitz.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The prompting of the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, first gives us a revelation and then enlightens our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan's impulses put many reasons and methods into our mind before asking us to actually perform some tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His initial work is to inject seeds of thoughts into the believers' mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These thoughts are sudden and always come with many reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times, we think that this is the prompting of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The work of the Holy Spirit spreads out from within, while Satan's work breaks in from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, as God's children, we should never consider sudden thoughts to be His will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should be careful, steady, and wait until everything is settled before we do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As to outward sudden stirrings and promptings, we should be particularly careful, because nine times out of ten they are not promptings of the Holy Spirit.</S>
