   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything that God is and has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, the indwelling God, and the incorporated God is included in the name of Jesus.</S>

Whenever I need to share a message and do not know what to say, I pray, O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! What are You speaking, Lord? When I pray in this way, I always receive a message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is my message; He is the living Word Rom 10:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus is every positive thing in the universe Col 2:16-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>EXPERIENCING THE BODY-CHRIST Being Knit Together</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Colossians 2:2 says, That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having our hearts knit together is a Body matter.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can gain a little of Christ as individuals, but we can gain much more as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to come together as the church in a united, knit-together way, having our heart and mind knit together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the church decides to do something that we do not agree with, we should not be dissenting but should simply go along with the church.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 6 says, As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The One in whom we need to walk is the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To receive Christ is to receive the Body-Christ, because Christ today is a corporate Body 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to receive this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regrettably, however, many Christians today would say that they care only for Christ and not for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we care only for Christ and not for the church, we can gain only a limited portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can gain much more of the riches of Christ when we care for both Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, we need to pray, Lord Jesus, I care for You, and I care also for Your Body, because I know that You are the Head and that the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I cannot have the Head without the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should pray, Lord Jesus, I know that today You are no longer only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You are the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, Lord Jesus, I receive You as well as Your Body.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most Christians today have been robbed of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most are spiritually poor and weak simply because they care only for Christ and not for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many of us in the Lord s recovery can testify that since the day we came into the church and began to care for the church, there has been a great difference in our spiritual life.</S>
