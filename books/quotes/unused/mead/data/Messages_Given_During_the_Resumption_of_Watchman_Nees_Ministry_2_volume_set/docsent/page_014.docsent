   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALLOWING HIS ELEMENTS TO OCCUPY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND REPLACE US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose you treat a person well and render him much help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Can you say that this is spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly speaking, this is very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, it may not necessarily be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How then can something be considered spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While you are fellowshipping with the Lord, He may tell you to help a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you obey His word to help this one, this is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, while you are helping such a one, you do so by trusting in the strength of the Lord all the time and acting according to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are not only performing what is after His heart; you are also acting according to His feelings and His thoughts, and you are taking Him as your content and as everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day by day, you will have more of the Lord, and gradually your thoughts and your natural disposition will decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Up to a certain point, your own elements will disappear, and the Lord will occupy your whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, you will be able to say that it is no longer you, but Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLE OF GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you have God's life, nature, thoughts, and love within you, and when you are filled with Him, God's desire will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God desires to mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has taken on man's form.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now He wants man to take on His form.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has put on humanity, and He has ascended to heaven with His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the God-man, and He is the Man-God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He desires to see that man has God, in the same way that He as God desires to put on man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God can now say, "O man!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I now have the human nature."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man can also say, "O God, our great God!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I now have Your nature."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is for this purpose alone that God created man, redeemed him, forgives his sins, regenerates him, and lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God desires to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is God's work?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's work is to work Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is God's principle, and it is God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>OF A CHRISTIAN'S LIFE AND WORK</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All our living and works have to be measured by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then will they be up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, here may be a brother who is very capable in leading the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he has never allowed God to pass through him, and if God has never worked on him before, his leading of the hymns will not carry much weight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if God is added to him, his hymn-leading will carry much more weight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person can save a large number of souls without allowing God to pass through him and without much mingling with God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A person can do many good works, help others, and visit many people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the question is whether or not he has allowed God to pass through him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The same is true even with the reading of the Bible and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many readings of the Bible end up being without God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you study the Bible much, yet you do not fellowship with God in your studying, your Bible study cannot be considered spiritual; it can only be considered mental.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is useless to study diligently the letter of the Bible without having any fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A proper Bible reading is one in which a person fellowships with the Lord through his reading.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This kind of reading becomes a kind of "gold plating," in which God is "plated" onto you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This will not be mere knowledge, but will become life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes even our prayers can take God away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the beginning of the prayer, we may still be fellowshipping with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But after a while, the presence of the Lord is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Prayers that are merely in the mind or in the flesh, that have no spirit in them, are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No wonder so many prayers are not answered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a person is not proper, even his prayers will not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real problem is with the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In reading the Bible, in praying, and in working for the Lord, the most important thing is that the person has to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A person cannot pray according to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever he feels within, he should pray according to that feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If he has only a few words, or if he feels to pray for a certain particular person, he should go ahead and pray accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is prayer in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The important thing is not that your prayer be beautiful, but that while you pray, God has one more chance to pass through you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the end, not only will you have your prayers answered, but by praying you will become like God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your view will be like God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Through prayer, you will allow God to work Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>ALLOWING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>TO BE THE HEAD OVER ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All those who have a heart for the Lord and who will answer His call will realize in eternity that what we are talking about during these meetings is something very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not be concerned whether a thing is good, bad, right, or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Instead pay attention to what lies behind the thing itself, to whether or not in doing such a thing, you are allowing the Lord to be the Head.</S>
