[1]  The Ground of the Church and the Service of the Body CONTENTS
[2]  We need to see the relationship between the church, the workers, and the work.
[3]  In our fellowship, messages, and prayers, we often use three terms church, workers, and work.
[4]  When brothers and sisters go out to propagate, the responsible brothers may announce, The church in our locality has decided to set apart one thousand dollars each month for the spread of the work.
[5]  This question demonstrates that the brothers and sisters are not clear concerning the relationship between the church, the workers, and the work.
[6]  For example, based on the context, the word church in Ephesians 1:22 refers to the universal church, whereas churches in Galatians 1:2 and church in Acts 8:1; 13:1; and 14:23 refer to local churches, churches in specific localities.
[7]  In the previous section we addressed the difference between the universal church and the local church.
[8]  For the past two thousand years the church has not been able to properly solve the question of how the workers are related to the local church.
[9]  For instance, whenever we go out to preach the gospel and do the Lord s work, we are His workers.
[10]  If we read the entire New Testament carefully, we will see that there were no apostles in the local church.
[11]  If we read these portions carefully, we will come to the conclusion that although there are no apostles in the local church, there are apostles in the universal church.
[12]  Although there is a work that involves the co-workers going out to labor, there is no such thing as the work being an organization.
[13]  Perhaps some might ask, Since there is no such thing as the work being an organization, why do we still say that there is a difference between the work and the church?
[14]  If our understanding is that the work refers to an organization, it is wrong to say that they are different; however, if we are speaking simply of the work, it is correct to say that there is a difference between the church and the work.
[15]  Hence, if a brother in the church in Manila has the Lord s leading to supply the church in either Hong Kong, Taipei, New York, or London, he has absolute liberty to do so, and no one should exercise control over this matter.
[16]  When saints who love the Lord see some brothers and sisters being called by the Lord to spread the Lord s work in a distant place, they may personally want to express their desire before the Lord by having fellowship with these brothers and sisters through the giving of material supply.
[17]  Because this matter has involved a number of brothers, we feel that we should have serious fellowship with all the churches concerning the ground of the church and our attitude toward the work.
[18]  Hence, although we do not approve of or encourage the brothers and sisters participation in any work or activity in Christianity or their involvement with any organized Christian group, we do not oppose these groups, because we are afraid that we will damage or hinder the sovereign work that God is doing for Himself.
[19]  Moreover, the main reason that we do not want to have any part in the work and activity of Christianity and its organized groups is that we fear to have improper involvement.
[20]  What we pay attention to is the intention in God s heart, that is, the church not only in its universal aspect but also in its local aspect.
[21]  I explained to him that we have never said that only we are the church.
[22]  However, we testify that only we are standing on the ground of the church.
[23]  Since we are already God s people, it does not matter whether we are in Babylon or in Jerusalem; all that matters is that we live before God.
[24]  The matter that I discussed with our dear brother is not a question of who we are but of where we are.
[25]  It was not a question of whether we are the church but of what ground we are on.
[26]  Regarding the negative reactions to the matter of the ground of the church, we should have some understanding and be watchful.
[27]  Furthermore, I told the brother that our Lord s table is absolutely open.
[28]  Nevertheless, we feel that since the Lord has commissioned and raised us up to bear a particular testimony we cannot open the responsibility for the ground to everyone.
[29]  If people condemn us, saying that we are an exclusive sect, because we do not allow others to bear responsibility for the church, this is a word of slander.
[30]  The reason we have some amount of spread and success is that we have not departed from the Lord s way, we stand firm for the Lord s testimony, and we take care of the Lord s work on the proper ground.
[31]  The New Testament does not provide a location for the universal church, but it does show us churches in various localities, such as the church in Corinth.
[32]  Today some people think that to pay attention to the ground of the church is to reduce Christ and the church, making Christ a small Christ, a local Christ, and to make the church a small church, a local church.
[33]  If some people say that we have made Christ and the church smaller by returning to the ground of the church, we simply cannot accept their word, because it is illogical.
[34]  However, in reality, paying attention to the ground of the church does not limit the Lord s work; rather, it becomes a great limitation to man s naturalness and flesh.
[35]  Hence, some people have asked, According to the truth you preach, if we return to the local ground of the church in order to worship and serve together, should we have absolutely no contact or fellowship with those on other grounds and no union with them in their work?
[36]  According to this principle, when we go to preach on a different ground, our basic attitude should be, I come here to speak Christ and the word of God to you, but you are on a ground that is not proper and is condemned by God.
[37]  In seeking fellowship, no one should have a definite opinion or preconception, claiming that our refusal to interact and work with other Christian groups is sectarian and wrong.
[38]  CHAPTER THREE THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK 2
[39]  Recently a brother who teaches at the National Taiwan University came with his wife to seek fellowship concerning our joining him in a students work.
[40]  When this brother came to us, he told us that he has no problem with us in regard to our inward condition because we love the Lord, are for the Lord s purpose, and want to live for the Lord.
[41]  There are two principles of examination: our person and our burden.
[42]  First, we need to see who we are; then we need to consider what we want to do.
[43]  Not only do we need to see God s eternal purpose, but we also need to see God s purpose in this age, that is, what God wants to accomplish today.
[44]  In regard to the authority of the church, our principle is that we do not require others to obey us; however, a person who works for the Lord should always obey the Lord s truths.
[45]  Even if we eliminated the word eternal and simply said that the expression of the local church is for the fulfillment of the Lord s purpose, we would still need to take care of this matter because it is related to the Lord s purpose.
[46]  The brother claimed that when the apostles went to the Jewish synagogues, they preached only Christ and not the ground of the church.
[47]  On the one hand, he acknowledged that what I said was right, but on the other hand, he still disagreed with us, saying that we should not emphasize the ground of the church, or we would become like the Brethren, who claimed that only their ground is right and that the other grounds are wrong.
[48]  While it may be easy for people to affirm that what they do is constructive and that they will not touch anything destructive, they may find that there are practical problems in carrying out their work.
[49]  We do not want to speak of others faults, but according to what we know, the background of every group can become a problem in the work.
[50]  We see clearly from the Word that the function of the church is to be the Body of Christ Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; Eph 1:22b-23; 4:4, 16 .
[51]  However, according to its local aspect, the church is expressed in different places at different times, representing the unique universal church and functioning as the Body of Christ.
[52]  God makes this kind of arrangement to show that the function of the universal Body of Christ should be the function of the church in any given locality, regardless of its size.
[53]  We all must see that the expression of the church as the Body of Christ is one.
[54]  In addition, in regard to the function of the church as the Body of Christ, we need to see that we are all members of the Body of Christ and that we should all fulfill our function as members.
[55]  When we come together, we are not merely gathering together as an assembly to express Christ within a certain locality; rather, we are members one of another, each one fulfilling his function, so that the church can be Christ s living Body in practicality.
[56]  The second condition is related to the administration of the church.
[57]  The administration of the church must be suitable so that the brothers and sisters can function as members.
[58]  If the brothers and sisters have not grown in life or have problems in regard to their growth in life and are unable to manifest their functions, they themselves will be held accountable.
[59]  However, if the administration and practices of a local church do not allow the brothers and sisters to fulfill their functions, then the administrative system and practices are accountable.
[60]  According to my observation, brothers and sisters in small local churches usually have sufficient opportunity and a proper environment that enable them to manifest and develop their gifts, unless they do not have a heart for the Lord or sufficient growth in life.
[61]  Because every district meeting covers a wide area, we need to readjust so that we may have the proper situation for the practice of the district meetings of the church.
[62]  Second, we need to see that the church of God on the earth is a matter of expression and that it cannot be separated from human community.
[63]  However, it is impossible for all the saints of God to be one church in respect to time, space, and church administration.
[64]  Finally, I have some feelings to share with the brothers and sisters.
[65]  Today a brother may go to a small locality where there is no church, and he may pray, O Lord, I am here, and I need to meet and serve.
[66]  As those who love Him, may we learn to be those who are spiritually rich, those who minister to the church and the saints, and may we learn not to cause the saints to suffer loss or the church to be damaged.
[67]  In our being we should have no intention to be the head or to be better than others; rather, we should desire only that the brothers and sisters receive supply through us and that the church be built up so that the Lord s testimony will become brighter and stronger, and more people will be saved.
[68]  Why does God want only one church in the universe and only one expression of the church within each locality, rather than many churches in the universe and many expressions within each locality?
[69]  Many times the responsible ones in the districts may have this kind of thought: It seems that because the brothers do not let me make decisions or carry things out by myself, they are not allowing me to fulfill my duty.
[70]  Since they do not let me make decisions and act independently, they are not allowing me to fulfill my ministry.
[71]  It seems that if we do not have a position, we do not need to do anything.
[72]  If there are thirty district meetings in the church in Taipei, and every responsible one takes this kind of attitude, instead of thirty districts we will immediately see thirty churches.
[73]  If an elder in a small local church is not that spiritual, it will not have too much impact, but in a large church with many district meetings and complicated affairs, the elders must be spiritual.
[74]  We need to see the aspect of the oneness of the church and the aspect of the functioning of all the members.
[75]  Since there is only one church, the elders, the responsible ones in the districts, and all the other responsible ones in the church must learn to keep the oneness.
[76]  In addition to keeping the oneness, there needs to be a proper practice; that is, not only do we need to function, but we also need to bring all the brothers and sisters into function.
[77]  Whether we are elders, deacons, responsible ones in the districts, or responsible ones in smaller groups, we need to learn the lesson of not allowing any of our actions or attitudes to damage the oneness of the church.
[78]  If we do not learn the lessons well, we may end up being unbalanced; either we will not keep the oneness of the church, or we will hinder the manifestation of the saints functions in an attempt to keep the oneness of the church.
[79]  In order to take care of these two matters, we should not rely on arrangements, systems, or human methods.
[80]  When we serve in the church, for the sake of keeping the oneness of the church and avoiding friction, we should try our best to coordinate according to the existing procedures.
[81]  CHAPTER SIX THE POSITION OF THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3 THE ONENESS OF THE BODY
[82]  God desires to gain churches for the local expression of His Body.
[83]  No matter how large a locality is or how many saved ones there are in a locality, God desires that the saved ones in that place be the local expression of the Body.
[84]  God desires that we not only maintain the oneness of the church in our locality, bearing a testimony of oneness, but even more that we express the Body of Christ in our locality.
[85]  We should not think that it is a small matter to argue about means of transportation.
[86]  In contrast, if someone were to stand up and say, Jesus is not God, not only should we dispute this, but we should also speak to him in a strong way, saying, If you do not repent, I cannot serve the Lord together with you.
[87]  Please remember that it is only when we coordinate together to serve, not when we merely unite together, that we are the Body.
[88]  Only when we are serving together and there is neither you nor I is there the Body.
[89]  If we are serving with a responsible brother who wants to meet at midnight, we should not argue about it, neither should we have much feeling about it.
[90]  Whenever we are making a proposal, we should sense that the Lord s cross is present.
[91]  Many brothers and sisters did not argue or fight when they loved the world instead of the Lord and did not care about anything related to the church.
[92]  The sad thing is that when they receive grace and turn to love the Lord, they begin to serve the Lord with their opinions, demanding that others do things according to their way.
[93]  They may have an opinion concerning the way we should read the Bible or concerning how we pray, whether we should pray loudly or quietly.
[94]  If others are talking about fellowshipping with the Lord, although we may feel that this is the time to preach the gospel with zeal, we should say, Thank and praise the Lord, for years I have not learned this lesson.
[95]  If the Lord would give us grace, we should learn to serve without the I. We are laboring and paying a price to serve; however, if we do not receive the Lord s mercy, we may end up taking a man-made, mechanical way to carry out the church life.
[96]  The Bible shows that the service God s people render to Him on the earth is not an individual matter.
[97]  At this juncture all the saints responsible for the districts must have specific prayers asking the Lord to quench their thirst.
[98]  As those serving the Lord, our thirst must be quenched so that we can continue to serve.
[99]  As we are practicing district meetings and as we are serving the Lord in the districts, we will likely encounter men s flesh; that is, we will encounter Amalek.
[100]  I hope that the brothers and sisters will see these three points: We need to receive the impartation of the Holy Spirit to quench our thirst, we need to receive the breaking of the cross in order to receive the impartation of the Holy Spirit, and we need to learn to depend on the Lord and support one another.
[101]  We must see that serving in the Lord s presence is altogether a matter of coordination; it is not a worldly movement.
[102]  This is because we have each seen our place in God s arrangement, and each of us knows where we should be and what part we should fulfill.
[103]  For instance, we may say to a newly saved brother, Brother, we break bread because we have the Lord s life, and we live by the Lord s life.
[104]  When we have spiritual fellowship with a new one, and when he receives help from us to come to the table meeting on the Lord s Day, we can tell the responsible brothers in the district that he is truly saved and able to participate in breaking the bread.
[105]  In our further fellowship with the responsible one, we can testify that in our fellowship with this new one, we touched the Lord s grace, and we are willing to introduce him to the brothers and sisters.
[106]  I hope that God will have mercy on us and cause us to see that we are not serving merely as individuals but that we need to enable the brothers and sisters to serve together.
[107]  CHAPTER NINE THE EYES OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES
[108]  AND THE MOVING WHEELS Scripture Reading: Rev 4:6, 8; Ezek.
[109]  Whenever the Bible speaks of the four living creatures, it is to show the kind of condition we should have before God in our service.
[110]  In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the condition we should have in our service based on two items seen in Revelation 4 and Ezekiel 1, that is, the eyes of the four living creatures and the moving wheels.
[111]  There are two basic principles for our move: one is that our move must have a direction, and the other is that our move must be multidirectional.
[112]  Often, however, we are quiet because we are afraid that we will not supply others or we feel that we cannot speak well, not because in our spirit we feel to be quiet.
[113]  We must realize that seeing controls our move and that this move has a direction and is also multidirectional.
