   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTIONS OF RESURRECTION Conquering Negative Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This life-power has a number of functions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first function is that of conquering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Resurrection is able to conquer every negative thing, including death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from God Himself, the most powerful thing in the universe is death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever death visits anyone, that one cannot resist it; he must yield to its power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although death is so powerful, resurrection is even more powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Death cannot hold resurrection Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, resurrection conquers death and overcomes it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Corinthians 15:26 Paul says, The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that death is the strongest enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a strong enemy can be defeated only by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the first function of resurrection, of the life-power, is that of conquering the negative things, especially death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more resurrection is placed in a situation of death, the more opportunity it has to function to conquer death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Swallowing Up Death</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second function of the life-power is to swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Resurrection not only conquers death and overcomes it, but it also devours it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Numbers 14:9 Caleb said that the enemies of the children of Israel would be their food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Death, the last and greatest enemy, is food for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes an enemy is conquered, but he is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through the function of the life-power, death is not only conquered, but is swallowed up to the point that it disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the life-power swallows death, death vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Producing Growth, Transformation, and Shaping</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The functions of conquering and swallowing are negative functions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Resurrection, however, also has many positive functions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first of these is to produce growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more something grows, the more it is changed, transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once again the growth of a carnation flower illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The carnation begins as a small seed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after the seed is sown into the soil, it begins to grow, firstly into a tender sprout and eventually into a full-grown, blossoming carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the carnation is still a sprout, it is difficult to distinguish it from other types of plants.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the more it grows, the more it changes and is transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is transformed by growth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In principle, the same kind of change takes place in children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a child grows, his body assumes a certain shape.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the life-power transforms, it also shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we grow, the more we are shaped.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, resurrection causes growth, change, and shaping.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Releasing the Positive Things</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Resurrection also releases the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fruit-bearing is one kind of release brought about by the function of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the bearing of fruit there is the release of the life-essence from within a certain tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that through fruit-bearing the riches of the life within that tree are released.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the releasing function of the life-power all that is in a seed the root, the stem, the branches, the leaves, the flower, and the fruit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the seed is resurrected, everything positive in it is released.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We often speak about the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ with all His riches has been sown into us as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We see this in the parable of the sower in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to this parable, Christ has sown Himself into us as a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This seed includes all kinds of positive things: love, holiness, righteousness, humility, patience, endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this seed are both the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only thing that is needed is the release.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Resurrection releases the essence of all the riches of Christ from within the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Power to Rise Up</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With resurrection there is also the power to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Resurrection, like the calamus used in making the anointing oil in Exodus 30, rises above the muddy situations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This calamus is a picture of the power in Christ to rise up.</S>
