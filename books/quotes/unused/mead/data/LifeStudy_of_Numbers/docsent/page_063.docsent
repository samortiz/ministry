   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Leading of the Ark the Crucified</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Resurrected Christ in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The remaining verses in chapter ten reveal the leading of the ark the crucified and resurrected Christ in His resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>33-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today, the leading One among the churches is the crucified and resurrected Christ, who is the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Sons of Israel Setting Out</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>from the Mount of Jehovah Three Days' Journey,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah Going</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>before Them to Seek Out a Resting Place for Them</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"They set out from the mount of Jehovah three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them" v. 33 . Here we see that the sons of Israel went three days' journey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way was not paved, the oxen were slow, and travel for the wagons was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the ark Christ of the covenant of Jehovah went before them to seek out a resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ark, with all the contents of the tabernacle, including the altar, showbread table, lampstand, and incense altar, was the responsibility of the Kohathites and was borne by them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Kohathites should have set out after the camp of Reuben; nevertheless, the ark came to the front to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a difference between guidance and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The term guidance is used with respect to the cloud and the blowing of the trumpets, but concerning the ark we have used the term leading.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Guidance is general; leading is particular.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The cloud and the trumpet guided the children of Israel in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the ark did not render a general guidance but a particular leading to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the ark became the leader, taking the lead to find a resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the forty years the children of Israel traveled in the wilderness, it was difficult to find a resting place for two million people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today our Christian life is a long journey on a rugged, unpaved way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we are journeying on this rugged way, it is not easy for us to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus, the Forerunner, has cut the way Heb 6:20 , but He did not pave the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He passed through the rugged way, and now we are following His footsteps on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have need of a resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here no one, not even the older and more experienced ones, can help us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning this, we should not put our trust in man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The unique One in whom we can trust is Christ as the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the Leader, and He leads us to the proper place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He not only guides us in a general way but leads us in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Numbers 10 the real leader was not Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time, even Moses was inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ark led the children of Israel in a particular way, much like a small boat leads a large ship through a narrow strait and a swift current into the harbor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only was the ark a living ark, but the rock that followed the Israelites was also living Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the wilderness Christ followed the children of Israel as a rock to supply them with living water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the ark, He was their Leader, taking the lead to find a resting place for them and to lead them through the hard part of their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The children of Israel were led not by man Moses' father-in-law but by the ark Christ of God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that the leadership of Christ is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This leadership is not according to emotion or affection but according to a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants to bring them into the good land Gen 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, God's covenant was placed in the ark, and thus the ark was called the ark of the covenant Num 10:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, Christ is the Christ of the covenant, the Christ of God's faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ must lead us into a resting place because He is the Christ of God's covenant.</S>
