   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Joy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Let us eat, and be merry."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The joy came in the feasting on the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our salvation is one of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is our fatted calf, our bread of life, to supply us and to bring us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In contrast to the robe, the ring, and the shoes, which are visible, the calf is eaten and disappears from sight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is digested and assimilated to become part of the fibers of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its effect on us is to strengthen, empower, sustain, support, comfort, and satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such is our subjective Savior to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is why eating brings joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Growth</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are not changed by power or magic.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your present height is probably over five feet and your weight more than a hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Were you born that size?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Did you become that big by fasting for three days and then instantly change from infant to adult?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By no means.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your growth came about gradually by regular eating.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You could not have grown by eating pearls or diamonds, because they are not food and your body could not have digested them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fatted calf is not an empty term.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a picture that Christ satisfies us by being taken into us as food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day we cooperate with Him by opening to take Him in as we pray-read His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the way Christ is formed in us, makes His home in our hearts, and transforms us into His image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As you read the word for nourishment, take only a small portion at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don't try to swallow the fatted calf in one gulp!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Four or five small meals a day is best for your gradual and steady spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though the eating of Jesus is the focal point of the New Testament, it has been neglected by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1958 the Lord began to recover this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1965 we had a series of messages in Los Angeles on the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Right after that the Lord gave us pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How rich the pray-reading of the Word was in 1968 and 1969!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope the saints will come back to this nourishing way of taking in the Word and will thus eat of Jesus as the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE PROTEST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The story of the prodigal son ends with the conversation between the father and the elder son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What made the elder son angry in the father's treatment of the returned prodigal?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Notice that the complaint was not about the robe, the ring, or the shoes, but "Thou hast killed for him the fatted calf" Luke 15:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The outward gifts of the father did not cause the elder son's resentment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was the killing of the fatted calf that enraged him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as the Pharisees and scribes murmured that the Lord was eating with sinners, so in our day religious people are offended when they hear of eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The objective teachings they do not oppose, but the subjective experience of Christ as our food they reject.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>INVITED TO A FEAST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are other parables in the Gospels which also refer to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Luke 14:16-24 there is the parable of the great supper, where those who were invited made excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually the house was filled, not with them, but with the poor, the crippled, and even some who were compelled to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a picture this is of how the chosen ones spurned the Lord's offer of Himself as a feast!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew 22:1-14 recounts that a king made a marriage feast for his son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When everything was ready the oxen and the fatted beasts killed the invited ones again would not attend, and others were found in the thoroughfares and invited instead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One of the guests at the table was found not to have on a marriage garment and was cast into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The oxen and the fatted beasts refer to Christ, who was killed that God's chosen people might enjoy Him as a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Gentiles were sought in the thoroughfares after the Jews' rejection of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To enjoy the marriage feast requires not only the "best robe" but the marriage garment as well, a picture of Christ experienced as our subjective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Notice how Christ portrays His coming, in both its first and second aspects, as a king's marriage feast for his son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ came that His people might have their hunger satisfied by taking Him as their feast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That feast was opened to all when "those who were His own did not receive Him" John 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This feast in fullness will be enjoyed by the overcoming believers in the next age.</S>
