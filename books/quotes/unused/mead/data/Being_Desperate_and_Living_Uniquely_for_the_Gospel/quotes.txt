[1]  CONTENTS Door-Knocking and Fruit-Bearing Qualifications of Door-Knocking for Fruit-Bearing The Kernel from Exodus to First Kings
[2]  CHAPTER ONE DOOR-KNOCKING AND FRUIT-BEARING Scripture Reading: John 15:2, 4, 16a; Matt 21:34, 43 POSITIVE RESULTS OF THE LORD'S NEW WAY
[3]  Since October of 1984 the Lord has been speaking to us concerning His new way for His new move.
[4]  A leading brother there wanted to let me know how the Lord has been blessing their door-knocking since they began to take the trained way of one out of four saints knocking on doors for two to three hours a week.
[5]  In October they had the saints sign up to be on a team and to make a definite consecration to give two hours each week for the door-knocking.
[6]  This brother pointed out in his letter that although the outward practices have to be preceded by the inward filling of the Spirit, it seems that the Lord will bless the outward practices of the new way if they are strictly applied.
[7]  In the full-time training in Taipei, I told the trainers not to bring the new ones to the church meetings.
[8]  Occasionally, some new ones asked the trainees to bring them to a church meeting.
[9]  After one or two church meetings, these new ones said they did not want to go to the church meeting again.
[10]  Baptism is not a ritual, but we have made it a ritual by our practice.
[11]  Furthermore, we have not had much feeling about our years of barrenness in which we did not bring forth much fruit.
[12]  One leading brother told me that he did not bring anyone to the Lord for twenty years.
[13]  In another two years, I believe the Lord will raise up a strong model in Taipei.
[14]  Among the new ones recently baptized in Taipei, close to one hundred will be full-timers.
[15]  Then He said, "Salvation has come to this house" v. 9 . He went to Jacob's well, and waited for a Samaritan woman John 4:6-7 . Why would we not follow Him? Why would we just follow Christianity, set up a church building, and be one of the hierarchies, inviting people and learning to speak eloquent things to attract people? Then once they are attracted by you and come to your meetings, they become dead Christians without any function.
[16]  We have tasted the old way, we have experienced the old way, and we have suffered from the old way Now many of us have tasted the Lord's new way, which is so sweet and so workable.
[17]  It is to build up the saints in the new way which involves: 1 Learning how to knock on doors, how to touch people with the high gospel within a short time, how to baptize them not only in water but also into the Triune God, and how to set up meetings in their homes.
[18]  2 Learning how to feed them the truths concerning the Triune God, concerning life, concerning Christ, and concerning the church, which means we have to learn how to teach the truths in homes.
[19]  If you are such a person who would pick up the new way and do it according to the trained way, I assure you that you will have a big success.
[20]  Recently the Cleveland area called a gathering for those who had been in the full-time training in Taipei to train some of the other full-timers and anyone available to go.
[21]  If you went out in such a desperate way, do you not think you could gain one per day?
[22]  What the Lord gave him, he kept throughout all the years until the Lord came back v. 25 . He even gave the Lord a message pointing out that the Lord was a hard man, reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not scatter v. 24 . Did the Lord justify him? He did not.
[23]  These are some solid verses in the New Testament concerning our destiny.
[24]  Do you believe one day He will ask you to give an account?
[25]  You may have offered yourself to the Lord many times in prayer, but your prayer may not have issued in a practical consecration of your body.
[26]  If you are a person abiding in the Lord all the time uninterruptedly, when you go out to knock on people's doors, that is the Lord's knocking.
[27]  You may have had the filling of the Spirit, but your long face to your wife spoiled it, so you have to make a thorough confession to get yourself adjusted, to get yourself cleansed, to get yourself right with a right atmosphere; then you will once again enjoy the filling of the essential Spirit.
[28]  You have the Lord, you have the word, you have the Spirit, and you have the Lord's authority.
[29]  My intention is to impress you that in the universe and today on this earth there is something called the gospel which we are reminded and commanded to live for.
[30]  Should we take the Reformation way, the mystic way, the Moravian way, the Wesleyan way, the Brethren way, the inner life way, the Pentecostal way, or the giant preacher way?
[31]  Are you happy to remain in a barren situation for years?
[32]  Then according to His word in Matthew 25, you will have to give Him an account of what you have been doing.
[33]  Will you tell Him that you have had a good church life in your locality, that whatever He has given you is still here?
[34]  One day you will stand before Him to give Him an account, especially concerning how much interest you have made for Him, that is, how many persons you have brought to Him.
[35]  Through my study in Taipei, I found out that this way works, but you must do it properly, not in a natural, old way, but in a trained, spiritual way, in the new way.
[36]  We hope that one out of twenty saints will be a job dropping full-timer and that one out of four saints will be a weekly door-knocker.
[37]  When you say that you live uniquely for the gospel, you have to consider the standard of your living.
[38]  In doing anything successfully there is a certain principle.
[39]  If you would take this way and practice faithfully to go out three hours weekly for four weeks a month, I assure you that you can gain one person.
[40]  After you visit them two or three times, they will join you to knock on doors.
[41]  John 15:16 says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain."
[42]  Very few babies die after being delivered today in the United States because after the delivery the modern hospitals have the best way to protect, shepherd, and feed them.
[43]  When you go to the home meetings you have set up to visit all these new ones, you will be happy.
[44]  The Lord will bless your setting up home meetings, and He will bless all the home meetings if you will practice this way according to what I have instructed.
