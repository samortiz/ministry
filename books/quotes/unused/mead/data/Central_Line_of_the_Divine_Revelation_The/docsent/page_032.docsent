   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INNER MAN OF ROMANS 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE INNER MAN OF 2 CORINTHIANS 4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible, we Christians now have two different inner men Rom 7:22; 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 7:22 Paul said, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here Paul was describing a situation that he experienced before he was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time, as a Jew, he delighted in the law of God according to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This inner man is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is proven by verse 25, which says, "So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mind in verse 25 is the inner man in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul said, "Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The outer man is our body as its organ with our soul as its life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The inner man is our regenerated spirit as its life and person, with our renewed soul as its organ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, in the New Testament, the inner man in Romans 7:22 is different from the inner man in 2 Corinthians 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE CREATION OF MAN BEING GOD'S</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>PRELIMINARY PREPARATION FOR THE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OF HIMSELF ACCORDING TO HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's creation of man as a three-part vessel was His preliminary preparation for man to receive the Triune God into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God's entering into our being is His dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before His dispensing of Himself into us, He made us with a body and a spirit to bring forth a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were prepared in such a way by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we as men are a soul with two organs: the body as the outer organ and the spirit as the inner organ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our spirit as the inner organ is suitable to receive and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is God's preparation for His dispensing of Himself into man according to His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AFTER BEING CREATED,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>MAN BEING PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After being created, man was placed in the garden of Eden Gen 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A garden is a pleasant and beautiful place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In God's newly created earth, God placed man in a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. In Front of Two Trees</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man was placed in the garden of Eden in front of two trees Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One tree was the tree of life, and the other tree was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tree of life symbolized God to be taken by man as his life of dependence v. 16 . The tree of the knowledge of good and evil symbolized Satan as the knowledge of independence, issuing in death v. 17 .</S>
