<h1 class="msg">Lesson One</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TRIUNE GOD BEING A MYSTERY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Scripture Reading</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Isa. 45:5; 1 Cor. 8:4; Matt. 28:19; Jn. 1:1;<br>2 Cor. 3:17; Heb. 1:8-9; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Outline</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God being only one</li><li>God being Triune&#151;Father, Son, and Spirit</li><li>A mystery of mysteries</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Text</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. GOD BEING ONLY ONE</H2><P>First, we must be clear that there is only one God. God is one. There is no other God. Our God is the only God; both the Old and New Testaments make this abundantly clear. Isaiah 45:5 says, "I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me." First Corinthians 8:4 says, "There is no God but one." In the whole universe there is only one true God. The God who has a good pleasure, will, eternal purpose, and economy is one. The God who chose us and predestinated us is one. The God who created the heavens, the earth, and man for His purpose is one. The God who loves man is one. The God who became incarnated to die for us so that we might be redeemed, forgiven, washed, justified, and reconciled is one. The God who resurrected to be our life to regenerate, sanctify, transform, conform, and glorify us is one. We have only one God: not two, three, or many, but one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD BEING TRIUNE&#151;FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT</H2><P>Although our God is one, there is something mysterious about Him. He is three-one, or "triune" (in Latin, "tri" means three and "une" means one). That is why we call Him the "Triune God." You may wonder where this term comes from, since there is no such number in human mathematics. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus says, "Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." Here the Lord speaks clearly of the three&#151;the Father, Son, and Spirit. But notice that the word "name" is singular. You may even say that the name of our God is "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Because of Bible verses like these, we can see that our God is one-yet-three and three-yet-one.</P>
