        <h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN LIVING NOT BEING SEPARATE<br />
FROM THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Although Christians can worship God individually, such worship is small and light; it is not weighty. For worship to be weighty, it must be the worship of saints gathered together. Likewise, the individual aspect of our service to God is light. Proper Christian service is corporate. We must serve together with other brothers and sisters in order for our service to be weighty. This is also true of our spiritual pursuit and spiritual life. Being delivered from sin, overcoming the world, being sanctified, and living for the Lord seem to be matters for individual pursuit. However, the more we pursue them individually, the more we fail to obtain them. In order to experience genuine overcoming, sanctification, and spirituality, we must pursue with the brothers and sisters. This is according to 2 Timothy 2:22, which says, &ldquo;Pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; Hence, even our spiritual life and spiritual pursuit should be corporate, not individualistic. This does not annul the individual aspect of the Christian life; rather, it means that our individual pursuit will be firm only when it is for the corporate pursuit.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in order to be a Christian, we must live in the church; we cannot be separated from the church. This is similar to the fact that a person cannot be separated from his home; he must live in a home. When he loses his home, he will become a pitiful and abnormal person without rest and warmth. In the same principle, we as Christians need a home, which is the church. If we are separated from the church, we are pitiful and abnormal Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN LIVING BEING ATTACHED TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The more a person fellowships with the Lord and lives in Him, taking Him as life and expressing Him, the less likely he is to be separated from the church. The more proper a person is, the less likely he is to be separated from his home. If he keeps things from his family, he is not a proper person but instead has a problem. A proper child will always tell his family everything pertaining to himself, whether or not it is significant, and he will always be attached to his family. In the same principle, everything pertaining to a proper Christian is related to the church. There are problems whenever a Christian is unwilling to let the church know his situation.</p>
<p>For example, if a student passes the entrance exam to a school but does not want to let the church know, then there must be something improper concerning that school. If a brother finds a job but is afraid to let the church know, then there must be something wrong with the job. When some young saints have secret friendships and do not let the saints in the church know, then there must be something wrong in their relationship. Hence, anything in our living or conduct that we are afraid to let the church know about or that cannot be related to the church is a problem and is not proper. Anything that we do apart from the church or without the knowledge of the church must be inappropriate.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we do not have any personal freedom. Everyone has personal freedom and privacy, which should not be violated. However, privacy is one thing, and hiding something from the church is another thing. We must understand the difference between privacy and a work in darkness. For example, I do not tell others how much money I have in my pocket, because this is a personal matter before God; it is not public. However, it is not a dark secret, nor is it something that I am afraid to let others know. If asked, I have nothing to fear in letting someone know. If the money in my possession had a suspicious source, it would not be something that I would want to fellowship about with the saints. It would be something in darkness, not in the light. It would also make me improper. Hence, in principle we should be able to let the church know everything related to our living and our walk.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING ORDER IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>There is order in the church life. There are parents and siblings in a family, and there is no confusion when each person maintains this order. For example, Brother Lin is neither the father nor the mother in his family. He has a younger brother and a younger sister as well as an older sister. Hence, he knows his place in his family. He knows who is above and who is below him. This is very clear. As another example, a family may have many naughty children who often quarrel among themselves. However, when something happens, they know what is the proper order. This is a normal situation in a family, and this is also the situation in the church. Brother Lin would probably say that in the big family of the church he is not the father, nor the mother, nor the oldest brother, nor the second oldest. He might say that he is the youngest. Such a reply is too humble, because in the church there will always be some who are younger. If Brother Lin has been saved for a year, those who have been saved for a month are his younger siblings.</p>
<p>This example shows that the church resembles the situation of a family, in which everyone keeps the order and knows his place. In some families the oldest son may be thirty years old, and his youngest sibling is only seven or eight years old. The oldest son is like a father to his younger siblings. This is also the situation in the church. A certain brother may be rather experienced in the Lord and is therefore more like a father than a brother to the others. Some sisters are rather experienced and are qualified not only to be an older sister but even a mother. We should respect such ones. Those who are clear concerning this matter will receive the greatest benefit in the church.</p>
<p>In this present age there is an undesirable trend, especially among the young people, that emphasizes equality and democracy. According to this trend, there should be equality and freedom within every social group. This is a dreadful thing. Suppose the youngest child insists on equality and democracy and says, &ldquo;This is the twentieth century. We should have equality in our home. Even though you are our father, you are the same as the rest of us. We should all stand on equal footing and practice democracy in everything. We should have a meeting and make decisions by voting.&rdquo; Would this be a family? In a family we should learn to love one another, and there should be mutual care, compassion, and warmth. However, there is also order in a family. There is a father and a mother, there are older brothers and sisters, and there are younger brothers and sisters. Even though they love one another, they must still keep the order in the family. The proper situation in a family includes order. This is also the proper situation in the church.</p>
<p>It would be dreadful for someone to say, &ldquo;We are all saved and belong to the Lord. We are brothers and sisters in Him; hence, we should be equal and democratic in the church. In every matter we should have a meeting and vote.&rdquo; As the house of God, the church should not be like this. In the church of God there is order. We all belong to the Lord and should have care, compassion, and warmth for one another, but this does not annul the order in God&rsquo;s house. First Peter 5:5 says, &ldquo;Younger men, be subject to elders.&rdquo; This word proves that in God&rsquo;s house there is a distinction between older saints and younger saints. There is harmony when the order is kept in a family.</p>
<p>If four or five saints want to preach the gospel in a suburb, can they keep the order and know whom to listen to? It would be a beautiful sight if they keep the order such that the younger ones listen to the older ones. In contrast, if they are in confusion because everyone is striving to be equal and democratic, they will not express the church. The church is full of Christ with love, compassion, and warmth, but the church is also full of authority and order.</p>
<p>Our authority is not the pope. Our authority is Christ the Head expressed in every member. Every member has the authority of the Head, which is the order ordained by the Head. This order is based on our measure of the stature of Christ. If a brother has a greater measure of the stature of Christ, is more mature in life, and more experienced in the Lord, he is an older brother and bears authority. If he does not express a measure of the stature of Christ, is not mature in the divine life, and is not experienced in the Lord, he is a younger brother and should be subject to authority. Hence, no one is the authority; rather, we should all bear the authority of the Head, and we should also be subject to one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVING THE CHURCH<br />
AND NOT CRITICIZING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>We must learn to treasure our household and to love all the members. We should not criticize or despise one another, nor should we discuss the shortcomings of our family members to outsiders. Such improper behavior will not be blessed. Let us consider our own families in the flesh. Even though we may see the mistakes of our parents or our siblings, we should not criticize them carelessly. This does not mean that I should be sent to the police station if I criticize someone. Rather, this means that since I treasure my family, respect my parents, and love my siblings, I will not criticize their mistakes, much less speak ill of them to others.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that one can encounter criticism, judgment, and despising in many Christian groups. A person who criticizes his parents or his siblings will not only have problems in his family but will also damage his family. Once a family suffers damage, the members also suffer a loss. Therefore, instead of criticizing or despising, we should find a proper way to render help in love.</p>
<p>The proper way to render help is to pray. If there is an appropriate opportunity to contact a member, we should stand in the proper position and speak. This is not to rebuke him but to admonish him. When parents make a mistake, the children can speak a few words to them, but not to condemn, despise, criticize, or judge them. Suppose an older brother or sister transgresses or offends another member, and a younger saint witnesses it. The younger saint will not be blessed if he criticizes, judges, or gossips concerning what he saw. He should bring the matter before the Lord in prayer and look for an appropriate opportunity to speak in a proper way and with the attitude and spirit of an instructed one. When the older saint is delivered, the church will also be delivered, and the younger saint will be delivered as well. This will preserve the church and give grace to all the members.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULFILLING OBLIGATIONS IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church is our household and dwelling place, in which we are not without obligations. This means that we should fulfill our part to love, support, and strengthen the church. We should not regard the church as belonging to someone else. The church belongs to all the saints. We must care for the church, just as we care for our own household. For example, if we see a &ldquo;broken window&rdquo; in the church as our dwelling place, we should tell a responsible brother, just as we would tell our parents or older siblings if there were a broken window in our home. If a &ldquo;broken window&rdquo; is not a concern to us, we are like an outsider. We have obligations and responsibilities in the church as our home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING ACTIVITIES IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the church is our home, we must function and serve in the church. In the prayer meeting we should learn to receive the burden and pray for the matters of the church. In the bread-breaking meeting we should learn to worship with all the saints. According to the Lord&rsquo;s leading and the strength that He gives us, we should participate in all the activities of the church, including gospel activities and shepherding the saints.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should live in the church. We should learn to recognize our place, be subject to the authority of the church, fulfill our obligations, and function according to our portion. We should also learn to fellowship with the saints. This is the church life; this is the life of Christ living in us and being lived out of us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
