When Saul was persecuting the church, on his way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus asked him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
He did not say, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My disciples,' but 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
He did not say, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My church,' but 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
Because the Body of Christ is the church on earth, Paul's persecuting of the church was his persecuting of the Lord Himself
If this were the case, Paul's persecution of the church could not have been considered as his persecution of the Lord
If we stand in the position of the Body of Christ, our number may be small, but we will still have a proper basis for forming the church
If we do not stand on the position of the Body of Christ, we will have no basis to form any church, even though our number may be very great
If the basis of the first 'church' is not the Body of Christ, one can, of course, set up a church that is based on the Body of Christ
In other words, whoever is of Christ should be in the church; whoever is in the Body of Christ may not be rejected
To accept anyone who is not in the Body of Christ or to embrace unbelievers is to go beyond the Body of Christ
There is only one basis for our fellowship in the church our being fellow members with one another in the Body
Any fellowship that is not as large as the Body, that is in fact smaller than the Body, is not the fellowship of the Body
We are here to maintain the fellowship of Christians, the fellowship of the Body, not any fellowship that is smaller than the Body
The Lord grants the members different kinds of gifts and ministries for the purpose of supplying the need of the whole Body
As the human body needs all the members, so the church needs the different kinds of gifts and ministries for its spiritual service
As long as you are a Christian you are a member of the Body of Christ and as a member in the Body you must have your own service before God
Another matter which requires special attention in the Body is that both the grace and the gift that everyone receives are different
The passage in Romans 12, in addition to speaking of the ministry of the word, includes ministries of other services in the church as well
Whether ones gift is big or small whether it is five talents two talents or one talent he should exercise what he has and serve accordingly
If all the one-talented ones will rise up to serve, they will be more effective than the few who have five talents
If all the brothers and sisters are working and laboring, it will be the church serving and the Body functioning
Everyone who has the 'mina' should realize that the handkerchief is for wiping sweat, not for wrapping up his mina
The kinds of people spoken of here are slightly different from those spoken of in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12
Corinthians 10:16-17 says, 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?
Whenever we come on the Lord's Day to break bread and remember the Lord, we acknowledge that the Lord has broken His body for us
The breaking of bread signifies the Lords giving of Himself in love on the cross for us the oneness speaks of the union among Gods children
Every Lord's Day we come to the Lord to acknowledge that His body was broken for us and that all of God's children are one
The more one understands the Body of Christ, the more he will testify of the oneness of the Body through the breaking of bread
The breaking of bread is a remembrance of the Lord's death, and it is an expression of the oneness of the Body
May the Lord be gracious to us, and may He show us clearly that the basis for forming the church is the Body of Christ
