   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we need to consider how Christ is the body of all the shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:16 and 17 Paul says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek words rendered in eating and in drinking may also be translated in food and in drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Food and drink signify satisfaction and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The feasts denote the annual Jewish festivals, which signify joy and enjoyment, and the new moons signify a new beginning with light in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the Sabbaths signify completion and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Feasts are yearly, new moons monthly, Sabbaths weekly, and eating and drinking daily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The body in verse 17, like a man s physical body, is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of a man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the reality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the good things in the gospel belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book of Colossians unveils such an all-inclusive Christ as the focus of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was a Christian for years before I gained a proper understanding of 2:16 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul s concept is that the various aspects of the ceremonial law are a shadow of things to come, of the spiritual things in Christ, just as a shadow is a figure of a person s body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The festivals, the new moons, the Sabbaths, and the regulations concerning eating and drinking all were shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The body, the solid substance, of the shadows is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many things in our environment of daily living are also shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, the food we eat is a shadow, not the real food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The real food is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is also the real drink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The clothing we wear to cover us, to beautify us, and to keep us warm is also a shadow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the One who truly covers our nakedness, who keeps us warm, and who imparts beauty to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is also our true dwelling place and real rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The houses in which we live are a shadow of Christ as our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The rest we enjoy at night is also a figure of Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the satisfaction we enjoy after a good meal is not the real satisfaction but a shadow of Christ as the reality of satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 16 Paul covers matters related to daily life, weekly life, monthly life, and yearly life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have pointed out, eating and drinking are daily, the Sabbaths weekly, the new moons monthly, and the feasts yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the aspects of our living are shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eating and drinking signify daily satisfaction and strengthening, and the Sabbath signifies weekly completion and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without completion, we cannot enjoy rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rest always comes from completion and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you have finished a certain matter and are satisfied with it, you are then able to be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After God completed His work of creation on the sixth day, He enjoyed rest on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that I can enjoy rest only when my work has been completed and I am satisfied with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the Sabbath signifies completion and rest on a weekly basis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A new moon signifies a monthly new beginning with light in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Recently I heard the testimony of a Jewish brother who was saved a few months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before he came to the Lord, he was in darkness, like all unbelieving Jews today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But now Christ is his new moon with light in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The feasts signify yearly enjoyment and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Three times a year, God s chosen people came together for the annual feasts, which were times of enjoyment, of rejoicing together before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the real food, drink, completion, rest, new moon, and feast.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Daily we eat and drink Him, weekly we have completion and rest in Him, monthly we experience a new beginning in Him, and throughout the year He is our joy and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is to us the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In chapter one Paul shows us that Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, the firstborn from among the dead, the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell, and our indwelling hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In chapter two he goes on to say that Christ is the mystery of God and the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After all this, Paul comes to our practical living, which involves daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly matters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The items covered by Paul in 2:16 are related either to the rotation of the earth on its axis, or to the revolution of the earth in its orbit around the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without this rotation and revolution, we would have no way to maintain our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of the earth s rotation and revolution, we have days, weeks, months, and years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we have pointed out again and again, the reality of all these daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly things is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In verse 17 Paul says that Christ is the body of all the shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that He is the reality of our food and drink, of our completion and rest, of our new beginning with light in darkness, and of our enjoyment and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every day, week, month, and year we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the positive things in our daily life, weekly life, monthly life, and yearly life must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ must become everything to us not merely in a doctrinal way, but in the way of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can testify that Christ is my completion, my rest, my new beginning, my enjoyment, my joy, my food, my drink, and my satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although Christ is universally vast, He is also all the detailed aspects of our practical daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Day by day, He is our breath and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>NO NEED FOR THE EXPRESSION OF OPINION</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 2:16 Paul says, Let no one therefore judge you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In verse 18 he goes on to say, Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to verses 20 through 22, there is no need for us to subject ourselves to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since Christ is the body of all shadows, we can be free from the judgment or opinion of those who advocate Gnosticism and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>From the time I came to this country and began the ministry here, I have told people to forget their doctrines and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to God s mathematics, only Christ has value.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Doctrines and opinions do not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What matters is the Christ who is for our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Throughout the years, I have learned not to hold to my opinions or to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Others, however, may strongly express their opinions even over things such as the kind of vacuum cleaner to purchase for use in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no value in arguing about such trivial things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I may have opinions about such matters, but I have learned not to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To argue on behalf of our opinions is altogether a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the church life we should have just one factor, one reason, one element, one source: Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Because Christ is our factor, reason, element, and source, there is no need for us to express our opinions or to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although we may have many opinions, we need to learn, by the Lord s mercy, not to express our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some people may prefer to eat with chopsticks, whereas others may prefer a knife and fork or even their fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What difference does it make as long as they take the food into them?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no need to express an opinion regarding utensils used in eating.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Opinion is the stronghold of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Although our opinions may be extremely strong, we can learn in the church life not to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This does not mean, however, that we agree with things such as idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must be strong to oppose that kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But regarding so many other matters, we need not express our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If Christ is truly everything to us in our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life, there will be no need for us to express our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have Christ as our unique factor, reason, element, and source.</S>
