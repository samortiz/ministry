[1]  All the words in the Bible are full of the revelation of God; therefore, we will first look at the line of the Triune God in the Bible.
[2]  The name of God that occurs most frequently in the Old Testament is Jehovah or Yehovah.
[3]  In Hebrew this name is composed of three words: Je represents a word, ho represents a word, and vah also represents a word.
[4]  This is not only a title used by a slave to address his master; it is also a title used by a wife to address her husband 1 Pet 3:6 .
[5]  If we are willing to spend time, we could find a hundred points on the attributes of God.
[6]  Of all the matters concerning God in the Bible, the most important portions concern the works of God.
[7]  Man, the center of this restoration, was deceived by Satan; he followed Satan and rebelled against God.
[8]  The creation fell, so God came in to redeem; yet some of the creation would not receive redemption.
[9]  Therefore, He came in and did some clearing up.
[10]  We will now look at the second line, the line of Christ.
[11]  In the Bible, there is no person, thing, or matter that is more important than Christ.
[12]  Christ is the highest and greatest center in the Bible.
[13]  Now we will see how the line of Christ runs through the entire Bible.
[14]  I. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT A. In God s Creation 1.
[15]  This is typified by Abel s offering of the fat portions of the firstlings of the flock 4:4 .
[16]  The firstlings of the flock and the fat portions typify the Lord Jesus as the means by which we fellowship with God.
[17]  In order for fallen, sinful men to fellowship with God, we cannot be in ourselves; we must be in Christ.
[18]  Abel s offering signifies that the Lord Jesus is the means by which we fellowship with God.
[19]  Christ is the Mighty Deliverer as typified by Moses.
[20]  When God s people fell into Egypt, they needed a salvation, and for this salvation, they needed a mighty deliverer.
[21]  The service of the children of Israel before God mainly involved the tabernacle, the offerings, and a group of priests the tabernacle includes the furniture, such as the bronze altar and bronze laver in the outer court, the golden lampstand, showbread table, and incense altar in the Holy Place, and the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies all of these items are included with the tabernacle .
[22]  All three categories the tabernacle, the offerings, and the priests refer to the Lord Jesus.
[23]  As for the furniture in the tabernacle, the bronze altar signifies His cross, the laver signifies the Holy Spirit who flows from Him, the showbread signifies Him as our bread of life, the golden lampstand signifies Him as our light of life, the golden incense altar signifies Him as our acceptance before God in resurrection, and the Ark of the Testimony signifies Him as our testimony and everything.
[24]  IN THE NEW TESTAMENT A. Christ in the Flesh
[25]  The four Gospels, which constitute the first section of the New Testament, show us the Lord Jesus in the flesh.
[26]  There are thirteen in s in the Old Testament: 1 in God s creation, 2 in the redemption promised by God, 3 in the fellowship between man and God, 4 in God s saving way for man, 5 in the covenant of grace promised by God, 6 in God s salvation to man, 7 in the journey of God s people, 8 in the service of God s people, 9 in the fighting of God s people, 10 in the inheritance of God s people, 11 in the kingdom of God, 12 in the sentiments of the experiences of the saints, and 13 in the prophecies of the prophets.
[27]  CHAPTER THREE THE LINE OF THE OFFICES OF CHRIST
[28]  The previous line, the line of Christ, is related to how Christ has become everything to God and to us.
[29]  The official service of the Lord Jesus is a great matter in the Bible.
[30]  All the kings in the Old Testament typify the kingship of Christ.
[31]  David typifies the Lord Jesus as a man, experiencing the sufferings of human life and dying in the end. Solomon typifies the Lord Jesus in resurrection, ascension, glorification, and reigning.
[32]  When we open the Bible and read at the very beginning in the book of Genesis, we see a very striking item the tree of life.
[33]  When we read through to the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation we once again see the tree of life.
[34]  In the beginning of the Bible the tree of life is present, in the middle there are stories of life, and at the end the tree of life is still present.
[35]  After God created man, He placed Himself as the tree of life and Satan as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in front of man, who had the highest life of all His creatures, so that man would choose according to his own will.
[36]  Man could choose God and receive life, or choose Satan and receive death.
[37]  The books of experience portray the experiences of the godly saints.
[38]  Although they knew the difference between the evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the life of the tree of life, they could not discern the difference between the good of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the life of the tree of life.
[39]  They knew that evil was not life, but they did not know that good was not life.
[40]  They renounced evil and desired to draw near to God by doing good, supposing that evil was enmity with God but that good was not.
[41]  The third part of the Old Testament, the section on the prophets, shows us that the prophets were fully released from good as well as from evil to live in the Spirit.
[42]  If you could speak with any of the prophets, they would say, I do not know what good or evil is; I only know the Spirit.
[43]  Therefore, a prophet is free from good and evil to live in God and to walk fully according to the Spirit.
[44]  The entire Old Testament shows us how God desires that man would receive Him as life and escape death by staying away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is outside of God.
[45]  God is building His eternal dwelling place with Himself as life and man as the material.
[46]  Therefore, on the one hand, life is a line that runs through the Scriptures, and on the other hand, building is also a line that runs through the Scriptures.
[47]  God wanted to build His dwelling place with man as the material, but before this task was accomplished, Satan came in to lure away the man that God wanted to use.
[48]  In order to restore fallen man, however, God established a way of redemption for man through a sacrifice the killing of the lamb and the shedding of its blood so that he might come back to God.
[49]  However, Satan came in again and caused man to refuse and reject God s way of redemption.
[50]  The ultimate city, the New Jerusalem, will be the union of man and God, the expression of God within man; yet the city of Enoch was the expression of Satan within man.
[51]  Even though Jacob dreamed this dream and received a vision, he foolishly still went on to his uncle Laban in Paddan-aram and foolishly returned from Paddan-aram to Canaan, the land of his father and his ancestors.
[52]  Later, due to the matter of eating, he went down to Egypt with his sons, altogether forgetting God s revelation.
[53]  While in Egypt, his descendants cared only for the matter of eating and ended up falling under Satan s usurpation.
[54]  God promised seed to Abraham as building materials; but due to the matter of eating, this seed went down to Egypt and was usurped by Satan.
[55]  While the house of Eli was utterly forsaking God, Samuel was absolutely seeking God.
[56]  According to the account in 1 Samuel, the boy Samuel was in complete contrast to the house of Eli.
[57]  The house of Eli forsook God, but the boy Samuel sought God.
[58]  The three lines of life, building, and the kingdom are closely connected.
[59]  God s desire is to build His dwelling place, and the building is through His life.
[60]  At the same time, in the building of life, there must also be God s authority; otherwise, the possibility of life and building would be out of the question.
[61]  In the center of the New Jerusalem there is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out from which proceeds the river of water of life, and on the two sides of this river the tree of life grows.
[62]  This picture shows that if God is not reigning on the throne, He will not have an expression of life, as signified by the river of water of life, or be the supply of life, as signified by the tree of life.
[63]  God wanted man to represent Him, express Him, and reign for Him.
[64]  However, man first needed to contact the life of God.
[65]  Regrettably, before man could contact the tree of life, Satan came and deceived man.
[66]  Regrettably, before long the descendants of Abraham went down to Egypt due to the need for food.
[67]  As a result, God lost the means by which He could reign on earth.
[68]  When the children of Israel were usurped by Egypt, they fell away completely from God s authority to Pharaoh s authority, being no longer under the rule of God.
[69]  When the church was established on the earth during Pentecost, Peter took the keys of the kingdom of the heavens and opened the door for the Jews and the Gentiles to believe in the Lord.
[70]  This brought God s authority to the earth so that man could enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[71]  In John 3 the Lord said that one must be born anew to enter into the kingdom of God.
[72]  All who have turned to the Lord have been delivered out of Satan s authority of darkness and have been transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God s love.
[73]  Ever since man was created, God has stood on the ground of a covenant in His dealings with man; these covenants with man are written in the Bible.
[74]  Therefore, the Bible is also referred to as the Old and New Testaments, or the old and new covenants, which shows the importance of God s covenants in the Bible.
[75]  Other religious writings talk about religious teachings, religious rules, and religious regulations, but only the Bible is a covenant made by God with man.
[76]  God made man in His own image so that man would represent Him and express His glory on the earth.
[77]  We should realize that the words God spoke were not ordinary words but extremely solemn and formal words.
[78]  This covenant shows that God s desire is that man would be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
[79]  The principle in the Bible is to use a proper woman as a figure of those who belong to God.
[80]  The enmity between the serpent and the woman denotes the enmity between Satan and all who belong to God.
[81]  According to this covenant, whenever we stand on God s side, we will surely encounter the enmity of Satan.
[82]  The earth was under man s rule, and man was the head and representative of the earth.
[83]  Therefore, after man sinned, the ground was involved and suffered God s curse Gen 3:17 .
[84]  The thorns and thistles that the ground brings forth are the sign of being cursed, signifying that all creation under man and ruled by man is cursed because of his sin.
[85]  After Noah was saved through the ark, God made another covenant with him, which is recorded in Genesis 8:20 9:17.
[86]  After Noah came out of the ark, he took of every clean animal and offered burnt offerings to God.
[87]  Even in Revelation 4, there is still a rainbow around God as a sign, indicating that the universe exists today because God has kept this covenant with His might.
[88]  All the words spoken in the following portions of the Word are the content of the covenant God made with Abraham, the called one: Genesis 12:1-3, 7, 13:14-17, 15:1-21, 17:1-21, 21:12, and 22:16-18.
[89]  This is an orthodox covenant, a covenant of grace; it is joined to the new covenant, and it is the basis of the new covenant.
[90]  Of the two seeds God promised to Abraham, one is earthly, and the other is heavenly.
[91]  All those who are saved are Abraham s descendants through faith; they are as numerous as the stars of the heavens and are heavenly.
[92]  The Lord Jesus is the seed God promised to Abraham; He is the One in whom all the families of the earth are blessed and the One who received the inheritance God promised to Abraham.
[93]  WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN THE LAND OF MOAB
[94]  After the children of Israel came out of Egypt to the foot of Mount Sinai, God made a covenant with them.
[95]  When the journey of the children of Israel in the wilderness came to an end, God made another covenant with them in the land of Moab before they entered Canaan.
[96]  The ultimate, highest, greatest, and most beautiful covenant in the Bible is what we commonly refer to as the new covenant.
[97]  The Lord Jesus came and accomplished redemption for us, and based on this God made the new covenant with us.
[98]  The Bible speaks of this covenant in many places.
[99]  In Matthew 26:27-28, when the Lord Jesus established His table, He said that it was a new covenant established in His blood.
[100]  In the Scriptures there is a clear distinction between different dispensations, and the line of these dispensations ties together the entire Bible.
[101]  According to the Bible, there are four dispensations; according to some Bible scholars, there are seven dispensations.
[102]  The former emphasizes the content of the dispensations, and the latter emphasizes God s seven arrangements with regard to man.
[103]  However, many Bible scholars point to seven dispensations, according to the unfolding of God s dispensational arrangements with man in the Bible.
[104]  This division into seven dispensations does not emphasize the content of the dispensations, but rather God s seven arrangements with regard to man.
[105]  The Bible is not merely a book about God; it is also a book about man.
[106]  If God and the Lord Jesus were taken away from the Bible, the Bible would become an empty book.
[107]  Therefore, just as God and the Lord Jesus occupy a particular place in the Bible, man also occupies a particular place.
[108]  The Bible reveals God and the Lord Jesus in order to show forth man.
[109]  The essential object of God s revealing of Himself is man; therefore, man occupies a very significant place in the Bible.
[110]  In the entire Bible, man probably takes up a greater number of pages than God and the Lord Jesus, because a greater part of the words written in the Bible deal with the things concerning man.
[111]  Israel, as the chosen descendants of Abraham, is seen in the record from Genesis 11:10 through Malachi 4.
[112]  The fourth group of people in the Bible is the church.
[113]  Since the four Gospels are a transitional point in the Bible, involving a shift from Israel as God s chosen people to the church, they speak about both the church and Israel, God s chosen people.
[114]  Just as the Bible speaks about God and man, it also speaks about Satan.
[115]  We should not forget that immediately after man was created, God put him in front of two trees: one was the tree of life, and the other was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[116]  We have mentioned repeatedly that the tree of life denotes God and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil denotes Satan.
[117]  Therefore, in reading the Bible, we should not only know the things concerning God and the things concerning man, we should also know the things concerning Satan.
[118]  Satan s nature is sin, and it results in sinning 1 John 3:8 .
[119]  V. THE KINGDOM OF SATAN A. Satan Having His Kingdom and His Authority
[120]  In Matthew 12:26 the Lord Jesus clearly speaks of Satan s kingdom.
[121]  In Acts 26:18 and Colossians 1:13, the apostle also speaks of Satan s authority.
[122]  According to these verses we know that Satan has a kingdom and authority.
[123]  THE WORK OF SATAN THROUGHOUT THE AGES A. Satan s Corrupting Work on Man 1.
[124]  Ever since Satan seduced man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and caused man to have his nature of sin Gen 3:1-7; 2 Cor 11:3; 1 Tim 2:14 , he has been at enmity with all who belong to God, all who stand on God s side Gen 3:15 .
[125]  B. Satan s Attack on Those Who Fear God
[126]  According to the Bible, Satan s work in the universe also involves attacking those who fear God.
[127]  He is always trying to attack those who fear God.
[128]  This can be seen in the book of Job
[129]  In the book of Job, Satan falsely accused the God-fearing Job twice before God Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6 .
[130]  After Mount Sinai, they went on their journey in the wilderness.
[131]  Even then Satan followed them, constantly doing a corrupting work.
[132]  Throughout their journey in the wilderness, the children of Israel frequently murmured against God, as recorded in Numbers 11:1, 4-6, 33-34, 16:41-49, and 21:4-6.
[133]  Even in the land of captivity, Satan did not let go of the children of Israel; he continued to corrupt them.
[134]  In the land of captivity, Satan destroyed the worship of God among the children of Israel, turning them to idolatry; he even caused the Babylonians to take the vessels in the holy temple that were for the worship of God and put them in the temple of idols in Babylon from which they drank wine and made merry.
[135]  In the Coming Great Tribulation a. Setting Up an Idol in the Temple of the Elect
[136]  According to the prophecy of the Bible, the Israelites will restore their nation and rebuild the temple.
[137]  At that time Antichrist will be raised up, and Satan will rise up to oppose God through him, setting up an idol in the temple, the idol being the image of Antichrist.
[138]  Satan causes the believers, like Ananias and Sapphira in the early days of the church Acts 5:3 , to deceive the Holy Spirit.
[139]  Paul says, All who are in Asia turned away from me 2 Tim 1:15 .
[140]  Although Satan has done some damage to the believers and the church, the believers and the church have victories over Satan as well.
[141]  I. Satan s Six Great Undertakings in the Universe
[142]  Of these works, six are quite important and every Christian should memorize them.
[143]  After these six great tasks, Satan s destiny will come to an end.
