<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Six</H2><P>Verse 6: "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate." </P><P>We will not cover the teaching of the Nicolaitans until we come to the section on Pergamos. Now, we will only mention their work in brief. No one knows who this party of people was in history. Previous writers have only hypothesized freely about this party; their theories are rather unacceptable. Whatever kind of people they were in Ephesus, they surely represented a group of strong ones in the whole church of God. Hence, the Lord purposely mentioned them twice. It is meaningless to merely say that they are an unknown sect. According to the interpretation of the prophecies in the seven epistles, the Nicolaitans, like Jezebel, typify a heresy. This word in the original language was composed of two words. The first means to subdue, and the second means the people. Hence, as far as the meaning of the word goes, the Nicolaitans means "those who subdue the people." After we have seen the works of these people, we realize that the way the apostles formed the church was gradually overturned. Some no longer consider all Christians as brothers. Some have established a group of "clergymen" who are higher than the ordinary believers. We do not see God instituting this in the New Testament. Everyone who is led of the Holy Spirit and the Word should see the danger in this work. If these "clergymen" are to have some ground and are to become successful, they have to divert the attention of the church and bring the church to follow a human leader while neglecting the heavenly Christ. In this way, the church will be divided and that which is completely spiritual will become worldly. The boundary between the church and the world will be erased, and the church will follow after the wiles and schemes of the world.</P><P>The apostles had spoken of the rise of this group of people before. When Paul told the Ephesians of "fierce wolves" (Acts 20:29-30), he was referring to this group of people. Peter also saw that this group of people were gaining ground in the churches. As a result, he told the elders who were receiving his Epistle to "shepherd the flock of God among you..nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock" (1 Pet. 5:2-3). John mentioned similar cases, particularly, "Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them" and how he cast out of the church those who would not submit to him (3 John 9-10). If we read the word of the Lord Jesus, we will realize His view towards this matter: "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave" (Matt. 20:25-27). "But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers" (23:8). Although God establishes His servants to take care of the flock, they are all brothers in position (23:8). Although the Lord has charged men to administrate the church, this administration is in the nature of service. These men are the servants of all and do not hold authority in the way that the Gentile rulers do (20:25-27). Christ does not recognize any group of people as having a special position in the church which others do not have, or as having a special authority to do certain things which others cannot do. We cannot say too much concerning this now. We will speak of this when we come to the third church.</P><P>The church in Ephesus hated "the works of the Nicolaitans." This was pleasing to the Lord, because He said, "which [the Nicolaitans] I also hate." They sympathized with the Lord. However, the Lord reserved the mentioning of this point until He had issued the warning. He intended to show them that they had to be careful. They had left the first love, and although they were still barely able to maintain it, their position was already quite shaky. They should be careful; otherwise, they would fall. If a church has lost its love to the Lord, it is rare to find it leaving human organization. Although it can perform for a while, its position is already unsettled!</P><P>Here we can see how attentive our Master is in expecting His church to arrive at perfection. Although there are but small blemishes, He rebukes and hates them. However, have we not frequently heard others say, "There is no perfect church on earth?" We can answer calmly, "What is meant by a perfect church?" Should not a Christian seek to be perfect in everything and to match God's holiness? If perfection is our personal goal, it should be the goal of the church also. We have to admit humbly that individually we make many mistakes. We also admit that the history of the church is the same as ours. Nevertheless, we should not avoid the responsibility for the pursuit of holiness. Self excuse is the prison of all fallen ones. It imprisons us and keeps us from repentance. We must not think that one failure will necessitate continual degradation. Only by being dissatisfied with our present experience will we be pressed to pursue the higher things. We should not say that becuase no one is without sin, we can therefore bear defilements in our spirits. When the Lord comes, the responsibility of every believer will be to be fully and clearly prepared. All those who wait until the Lord comes before they tie their shoes and gird their loins are liable to be left behind. The Lord's expectation for the church is the same as His expectation for the individuals, for as His Holy Spirit abides in the individuals, He also abides in the church. As the saints have received the power of the cross within them to counteract sin, the church has received the same. Hence, the whole should be the same as the individuals. Unfortunately, the church has failed. As for individuals, there are not many who have overcome either.</P><P>Here we see a most important principle: if a church has become unfaithful, and if the whole body has become disqualified to be the Lord's testimony on earth, God will give up the whole and will call the individuals to submit to God's word.</P>
