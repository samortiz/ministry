From the end of chapter thirteen to the middle of chapter seventeen we have a clear map showing us how to walk on the pathway as we follow our beloved King into glory.</p><p>The first thing we face on this pathway is rejection. Because Christ is the rejected One, we must be rejected also. We have no choice. Do not expect to be welcomed, for no one will welcome you until the glory comes. Instead, you must be willing to be rejected....Many of us have experienced some measure of rejection by those who opposed our coming into the church. But I need to tell you that this rejection will not decrease; rather, it will increase. There will be rejection upon rejection. Be prepared for this.</p><p>The heavenly King was rejected first by the Jewish religionists. The religious leaders rejected Christ to the uttermost because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion....After the Lord had been rejected in Jerusalem, the religious center, He turned to a geographical area that was not so religious-Galilee, the place where He was born and raised....However, He was not even welcomed in Galilee. Although the Galileans did not oppose Him, they rejected Him because of their natural knowledge.</p><p>If we would know Christ and follow Him, we need to realize that religion and natural knowledge are both veils.... [These] are two great obstacles frustrating people from recognizing who Christ is....According to natural knowledge, Christ was the son of a carpenter....His countrymen knew all of His outward features, but they did not see that God was in Him.</p><p>As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh or estimate them according to the flesh. We should know them according to one thing-according to the measure of Christ. Knowledge, intelligence, and outward appearance mean nothing. Perhaps a certain brother cannot speak well and uses poor grammar. Yet whenever he opens his mouth, Christ comes out. Even when you are sitting in his presence, you realize that some amount of Christ is with him. In the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we do not care for the outward appearance; we care only for the spirit within, where Christ is. This is the way to know Christ, the way to know other Christians, and the way to follow the Lord.

Politics is always alongside religion and culture. According to Matthew&#8217;s presentation, after the rejection by religion and natural knowledge, there is the rejection by politics. Herod the tetrarch represents the rejection by politics. This is the basic principle of 14:1-13.</p><p>Herod had John the Baptist beheaded in prison. In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost. This forced Him to forsake His natural relationship with them (12:46-50). Then in 13:53-58 He was rejected by the Galileans also. Now in chapter fourteen, Matthew, in his arranging of events according to doctrine, unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King&#8217;s forerunner. It was evil and full of corruption and darkness. To this point Matthew has given a full picture of the Jews&#8217;, the Galileans&#8217;, and the Gentiles&#8217; rejection of the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>In chapter fourteen we see the darkness, rottenness, and injustice in politics. Our eyes need to be opened to see that in religion there is no welcome to our heavenly King. Neither is there a place for Him in natural knowledge nor in today&#8217;s rotten, dark politics. In this generation there is no place for the heavenly King. Religion, culture, and politics are all one in rejecting the heavenly King. How I thank the Lord for the record in the Gospel of Matthew. If you read the chapters prior to fourteen, you will see the deceitfulness in the Jewish religion. You will also see that natural knowledge has caused great damage to people. Furthermore, you will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time. But even in the best political system there is nothing but rottenness and darkness. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 510-511)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>13<sup>1</sup> Because He had been rejected by the people in religious, cultured, and political circles, the heavenly King departed from them and withdrew to a deserted place privately. This indicates that thenceforth He would hide Himself in a deserted place, in a place without culture, away from the religious, cultured, and political circles. He did this by means of a boat, implying that He would do this through the church. Because He has been rejected by the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always hidden Himself in a realm without much culture, away from religious and political circles.</p><p>13<sup>2</sup> In spite of the rejection by all kinds of people, there were still a large number of people who followed the heavenly King. They did this by leaving their cities. It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in a deserted place. Through all the centuries the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 510-512; Hymns: #460, #473</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 11 - DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 14:14-21</h2><p>14 &nbsp;And going forth, He saw a great crowd....</p><p>15 &nbsp;Now when evening fell, the disciples came to Him, saying, This place is deserted and the hour is already late.

You <sup>1</sup>give them something to <sup>2</sup>eat.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And they said to Him, We do not have anything here except five <sup>1</sup>loaves and two <sup>1</sup>fish.</p> <p class="bold">18 &nbsp;And He said, Bring them here to Me.</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, <sup>1</sup>twelve handbaskets full.</p> <p>21 &nbsp;And those who ate were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>16<sup>1</sup> ...The disciples&#8217; concept was to ask people to do something; this is the principle of the law. But the Lord&#8217;s concept is to give people something to enjoy; this is the principle of grace.</p><p>16<sup>2</sup> In this record of the miracle, the Holy Spirit&#8217;s intention in His inspiration is to show that what the followers of the heavenly King actually need is the proper food to satisfy their hunger. The disciples of Christ did not know this, nor did the crowds who followed....All that they needed was His resurrection life, which would satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle.</p><p>What the heavenly King did indicates strongly and clearly that He provides for the necessities of His followers while they follow Him in this rejecting world. This corresponds with His word in the heavenly constitution saying that the kingdom people need not be anxious about what they will eat (6:31-33).</p><p>17<sup>1</sup> John 6:9 tells us that these five loaves were barley loaves. Barley is a type of the resurrected Christ (Lev. 23:10). Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. Loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ&#8217;s life, whereas fish are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ&#8217;s life. For our spiritual hunger to be satisfied, we need Christ&#8217;s generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both aspects are symbolized by small items-loaves and fish. This indicates that in this age the heavenly King came to His followers not as a great King to reign over them but as small pieces of food to feed them. See note 92 in John 6.</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> ...Twelve handbaskets full of broken pieces indicates not only that the resurrected Christ is unlimited and inexhaustible but also that the Lord&#8217;s provision for us is abundant, more than sufficient to meet all our need.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Although you may say that you do not have anything to offer to the Lord, you at least have yourself....Let us give whatever we are to Him.

He did this not in the deserted place but on the mountain, leaving all the people, even His disciples, that He might be alone to contact the Father.</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> While His disciples were distressed by the waves, the Lord walked on the sea.

He should have walked by faith in the Lord&#8217;s word, not by looking at the circumstances (i.e., by sight). In following the Lord we should walk by faith, not by sight (2 Cor. 5:7).</p><p>32<sup>1</sup> This miracle testifies not only that the Lord is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth but also that He takes care of the hardships endured by His followers as they follow Him on the way. When we have the Lord in our boat, the wind ceases. The record of the two miracles in this chapter implies that during the time that Christ was being rejected by people in the religious and political circles, He and His followers were in a deserted place and on a stormy sea. Whatever the situation, He was able to provide for their need and carry them through the hardships.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles....Because our destiny is in the Lord&#8217;s hand, there is no reason for us to be afraid of anything. The contrary winds and the opposition are under His feet. The Lord is on a high mountain praying for us and interceding for us....He laughs at the wind and seems to say, &#8220;Little wind, you mean nothing to Me. What are you trying to do? You can&#8217;t do anything with My church. Those in the boat are My followers. In fact, they are just Me. Although I am here in the heavens, I am also with them.&#8221;</p><p>In being quick and bold to step out of the boat and walk on the sea, we must take care of four things: first, that we act upon the word of the Lord, not without hearing a word from Him; second, that our direction is toward the Lord Himself; third, that we get into the Lord&#8217;s presence; and fourth, that we come back to the boat. If we take care of these four things, we will be right, even if we appear to be wrong.

They came to Him from their religious center, Jerusalem, in order to find fault with Him. However, their troubling afforded Him another opportunity to reveal the truth concerning genuine cleanness (vv. 10-11, 15-20). The Pharisees and scribes asked the Lord Jesus why His disciples transgressed the tradition of the elders. This reveals that the disciples did not keep the old traditions in following the Lord. They cared only for the heavenly King&#8217;s presence, not for anything else.</p><p>In the past, some of those who claimed to be for God had certain practices, and their practices eventually became the traditions that were observed by the Jews when the Lord Jesus was on earth....However, [these traditions were not commandments]...in the Bible.

A tradition, on the contrary, is something invented or initiated by man.</p><p>The Jewish religionists accused the Lord&#8217;s disciples of transgressing their tradition, but the Lord condemned the religionists for transgressing the commandment of God because of their tradition. They cared for their tradition, but they ignored God&#8217;s commandment. In principle, the religious people today do the same thing. The Roman Catholic Church and most Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions....In Christendom many still insist on the traditions, and in the so-called churches these traditions are very prevailing. But the Lord has raised us up to come back to the pure Word. We do not care for man&#8217;s tradition, teaching, or practice....The Lord Jesus and His followers were accused by the traditionalists, and today we are accused by the religionists. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 531-534)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>4<sup>1</sup> The Lord&#8217;s dealing here with the Pharisees and scribes not only condemned them for making void the word of God because of their tradition but also implied that man should honor his parents. God in His government among men has ordained that man should honor his parents. He has made this the first commandment among the ten commandments that concerns human relationships (Exo. 20:12). Fallen human nature, however, always prompts man to ignore his parents, that is, to rebel against God&#8217;s government. In order to bring man back to God&#8217;s government, the Lord as the heavenly King emphasized that man should honor his parents. This corresponds with His word in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens concerning the fulfillment of the law (5:17-19). Hence, the apostle also emphasized this matter strongly (Eph. 6:1-3; Col. 3:20). We, the kingdom people, must honor our parents and not excuse ourselves as the Jewish religionists did. To make any excuse indicates that we are not under the heavenly ruling but are following our fallen nature and the rebellious trend of today&#8217;s generation.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 531-535; Hymns: #814</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 11 - DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 15:8-9, 11-14, 18-20</h2><p>8 &nbsp;&#8220;This people honors Me with their lips, but their <sup>1</sup>heart stays far away from Me;</p> <p>9 &nbsp;But in <sup>1</sup>vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.&#8221;</p><p class="bold">11 &nbsp;It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this <sup>1</sup>defiles the man.</p><p>12 &nbsp;Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?</p><p>13 &nbsp;And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has <sup>1</sup>not planted shall be rooted up.</p> <p>14 &nbsp;Let them be.

Because Christ is the rejected One, we must be rejected also. We have no choice. Do not expect to be welcomed, for no one will welcome you until the glory comes. The heavenly King was rejected to the uttermost first by the Jewish religious leaders because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion. Then the Galileans-thinking they knew everything about Him-rejected Him because they were blinded by their natural knowledge. They knew Him according to the flesh not according to the spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). If we would know Christ and follow Him, we need to realize that religion and knowledge are both veils, even two great obstacles, frustrating people from recognizing who Christ is. As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh but according to the measure of Christ, not caring for the outward appearance but only for the spirit within.</p><p>In Matthew 14 we see the darkness, rottenness, and injustice in politics. Politics is always alongside religion and culture. Herod the tetrarch represents the rejection by politics. This is the basic principle of vv. 1-13.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s miraculous feeding of the crowds in the wilderness portrays our situation after we have experienced and passed through rejection. We will be in want and have certain needs. But the Lord has a way to meet our need. We should simply offer what we are and what we have into His hand, let Him break the offering, and let the broken offering feed the hungry ones. If we do this, we will enjoy satisfaction, and there will be a surplus remaining.</p><p>The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles. Do not be troubled by any storms, for we are in the boat, the Lord&#8217;s church. Whether the Lord is on the mountain interceding or on the waves walking toward us, we should not be disturbed. With the Lord&#8217;s word we may walk to meet Him, even walking through all the opposition and upon it. This is faith. It was a miracle that Peter could walk on the water. He walked on the waves by faith. Faith simply means that, although we may be very weak, we dare to act upon the Lord&#8217;s word.</p><p>The Jewish religionists accused the Lord&#8217;s disciples of transgressing their tradition (15:1-2). But the Lord condemned the religionists for transgressing the commandment of God because of their tradition (v. 3). In this way He brought them back to the pure Word. Those who follow the traditions may claim to know the Bible, but actually they are completely blind and have no light at all. The Pharisees cared only for the outward tradition, ritual, and practice, for example, the washing of hands. Therefore, the Lord Jesus pointed them to the inward matter of the heart (vv. 8, 18-20). In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we treasure the pure Word and the inward experience of Christ, the inward reality. Tradition is a matter of utterance from the lips without reality in the heart.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 12 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 15:21-22, 24-28</h2><p>21 &nbsp;And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of <sup>1</sup>Tyre and Sidon.</p> <p>22 &nbsp;And behold, a <sup>1</sup>Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, <sup>2</sup>Lord, Son of David!

And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>21<sup>1</sup> The further troubling by the rejecting religionists caused the heavenly King to depart farther from them, even into the districts of Tyre and Sidon, into a Gentile land.</p><p>22<sup>1</sup> Because of the rejection by the religious Jews, the opportunity to contact the heavenly King came to the Gentiles, even to a weak Gentile woman.</p><p>22<sup>2</sup> The title Lord implies Christ&#8217;s divinity, and the title Son of David, His humanity. It was proper for this woman, a Gentile, to address Christ as &#8220;Lord.&#8221; However, she had no right to call Him &#8220;Son of David&#8221;; only the children of Israel were privileged to do so.</p><p>24<sup>1</sup> The Lord was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. However, at this time He came to a Gentile region, thus affording the Gentiles an opportunity to participate in His grace. This bears dispensational significance, showing that Christ came to the Jews first and that because of their unbelief, His salvation turned to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46; Rom. 11:11).</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> This second time she addressed Christ only as &#8220;Lord,&#8221; not as &#8220;Son of David,&#8221; because she realized that she was not a child of Israel but a heathen.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Here [in verse 26] another opportunity was created for [the heavenly King] to reveal Himself, this time as the children&#8217;s bread. The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord-a divine person-and the Son of David-a royal descendant, great and high in His reign. But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food. This implies that as the heavenly King, He rules over His people by feeding them with Himself as bread. We can be the proper people in His kingdom only by being nourished with Him as our food. To eat Christ as our supply is the way to be the kingdom people in the reality of the kingdom.</p><p>The Lord said that the children&#8217;s bread should not be thrown to the dogs. This indicates that in the eyes of the Lord all the heathen are dogs, which are unclean in the eyes of God (Lev. 11:27).</p><p>The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord&#8217;s word but admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, had come as a portion to the children of Israel. But they threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile land, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles. What a realization this Gentile woman had at that time! No wonder the heavenly King admired her faith (v. 28).

Hidden within this temptation of the Lord Jesus, there was leaven....When we eat bread, we may not realize that we are also eating leaven, for leaven is hidden in the bread and thus is invisible. Although no one could see the leaven hidden in the temptation presented by the Pharisees and Sadducees, it was nonetheless concealed within it.</p><p>As we have seen, chapter fifteen deals with the matter of eating. From 15:1 through 16:12, Matthew&#8217;s record is very much concerned with eating. Eating unclean things may defile us (15:1-20). What we need is not the outward washing, but the inward eating. Eating is the way to partake of Christ (15:21-28), and eating causes Gentile dogs to become children of God, even proper men. By eating we feed on the unlimited and inexhaustibly rich supply of Christ (15:32-39). Matthew 15 concludes with the record of corporate eating. However, we must beware of eating leaven (16:5-12), especially the religious leaven hidden within religious people, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Pharisees were the ancient fundamentalists, and the Sadducees were the ancient modernists. I am thankful that the Bible mentions them both. In today&#8217;s religion there are also fundamentalists and modernists. The first group, the fundamentalists, have sound, scriptural beliefs. The second group, the Sadducees, deny what the Bible says.</p><p>In Christianity religious people...always have some leaven. Under the cloak of religion, they bring in certain matters that corrupt and damage the things of God. Therefore, we must learn to beware of leaven as we are enjoying Christ as our heavenly bread....We need to realize that leaven may often be concealed under the cloak of religious teachings.... [Moreover], those who bring in leaven desire to see signs, miracles....In 16:1-12 the two key words are sign and leaven. The Pharisees and Sadducees...asked...[the Lord Jesus] to show them a sign from heaven. [But] in speaking of the sign of Jonah [v. 4], the Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;You...do not need miracles....You need to...repent...and...believe that I will die for your sins and be resurrected to impart Myself into you as life. This is the sign for this generation. No other sign will be given. I am the sign to you, the sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ....&#8221;...Every miracle, every sign, must be based upon the principle of the crucifixion and the resurrection....Otherwise, the miracles will simply be a type of leaven.

Hence, both the teaching of the Pharisees and the teaching of the Sadducees were impure and evil and were likened to leaven, which was not to be seen among God&#8217;s people (Exo. 13:7).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 555-561; Hymns: #541</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 12 - DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 16:13-17</h2><p class="bold">13 &nbsp;Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</p> <p>14 &nbsp;And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</p><p class="bold">15 &nbsp;He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the <sup>1</sup>Christ, the <sup>1</sup>Son of the <sup>2</sup>living God.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In 16:13-20 we come to a section of the Gospel of Matthew concerned with the revelation of Christ and the church. Before we consider the details of this section, we need to consider the connection between it and the foregoing section, verses 1-12.</p><p>Verse 13 says that the Lord Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi with His disciples and there asked them, &#8220;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&#8221; It seems that this is not related to the matter of leaven. Caesarea Philippi is in the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border, at the foot of Mount Hermon, on which the Lord was transfigured (17:1-2). It was far from the holy city and the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled every man&#8217;s thought, leaving no room for Christ, the new King. The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with its clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which are the pulse of His heavenly kingdom. It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter (16:16-17). It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 18-19).</p><p>The connection between these two portions of the Word...is that if we are still under the influence of religious leaven, we will never be clear about Christ or the church....If we still hold the concept that there is nothing wrong with Christmas or with the denominations, it is an indication that our understanding is saturated with hidden religious leaven....Many of us have been leavened from the time we were born....To you, the church was a bungalow with a high tower and bell....Therefore, we need to leave the religious center and go far to the north, to the region of Caesarea Philippi, where the sky is clear. Also, we need to say to the Lord inwardly, &#8220;Lord Jesus, purify me of every kind of leaven. I don&#8217;t want there to be fog without or mist within. I want to be a clear person under a clear sky.&#8221; (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 561-564)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>16<sup>1</sup> The Christ refers to the One concerning whom God prophesied in the Old Testament through the prophets and whom His saints through the ages looked for (John 1:41, 45; Luke 2:25-26; 3:15), the One who would come to accomplish the will of God (Heb. 10:5-7). </p><p>The Christ, referring to the anointed One of God, speaks of the Lord&#8217;s commission, whereas the Son of the living God, referring to the Second of the Triune God, speaks of His person.

Yet the Lord&#8217;s prophecy here still has not been fulfilled, even up to the twentieth century. The Lord is not building His church in Christendom, which is composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations. This prophecy is being fulfilled through the Lord&#8217;s recovery, in which the building of the genuine church is being accomplished.</p><p>18<sup>5</sup> Gk. ekklesia, meaning an out-calling.

This word of the Lord&#8217;s indicates also that Satan&#8217;s power of darkness will attack the church. Hence, there is spiritual warfare between Satan&#8217;s power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God&#8217;s kingdom.</p><p>19<sup>1</sup> According to history there were two keys. Peter used one on the day of Pentecost to open the gate so that the Jewish believers could enter the kingdom of the heavens (Acts 2:38-42), and he used the other in the house of Cornelius to open the gate so that the Gentile believers could enter (Acts 10:34-48).</p><p>19<sup>2</sup> Kingdom of the heavens is used here interchangeably for church, which is used in the previous verse. This is a strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. This is confirmed by Rom. 14:17, in which the kingdom of God is mentioned in obvious reference to the proper church life.</p><p>19<sup>3</sup> This Gospel is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority. The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom with its reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself (18:17-18).</p><p>19<sup>4</sup> Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth must be something that has already been bound or loosed in the heavens.

This is the unique way for Christ to be released, and it is also the unique way for the church to be built with Christ and upon Christ.</p><p>After the revelation of the great mystery concerning Christ and the church, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ were unveiled. In order for Christ to build His church, He had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection. In verse 21 the Lord first revealed to His disciples His crucifixion and resurrection. Before this time, He had not mentioned anything about these things. Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His enlightened disciples His crucifixion and resurrection. This is very meaningful. After we see Christ and the church, we must be prepared to take the way of the cross. You may be wondering what the way of the cross is. To take the way of the cross is not to reserve anything of the self. No matter how good, right, or profitable you may be, you need to be crucified. For the enjoyment of Christ and for the building of the church, we must be crucified. Nothing of our being should be reserved.</p><p>In verse 21 the Lord Jesus spoke both of His crucifixion and His resurrection. The disciples, however, picked up the matter of crucifixion, but neglected the matter of resurrection. The disciples heard that the Lord was to be killed, but it seems that they did not hear that He would be resurrected. Nevertheless, the Lord did say that He would be raised on the third day. They did not grasp this part of the Lord&#8217;s word because they had no concept of resurrection....It is the same with us today. We immediately take in whatever corresponds to our concept. But if a certain thing does not correspond to what is already within us, we do not take it in....Again I say that although the Lord Jesus spoke of two matters, crucifixion and resurrection, the disciples grasped the first, but not the second.</p><p>Without Peter, we would not have so many revelations, for through his boldness in making mistakes a number of revelations were given. Here [in verse 22] Peter was bold enough to rebuke the Lord. As Peter was rebuking the Lord, his expression might have been that of Satan. Peter&#8217;s words-&#8220;God be merciful to You, Lord&#8221;-sound very nice, but they were actually a rebuke. Peter had been offended by the Lord&#8217;s word about being killed. Because he was fully in himself, he actually rebuked the Lord Jesus.

Our mind is the expression of our self, and our self is the embodiment of our soul-life. Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion. When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened with Peter. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s subsequent word indicated that Peter had to deny himself, i.e., not save his soul-life but lose it. Losing the soul-life is the reality of denying the self. This is to take up the cross.</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. If the heavenly King&#8217;s followers allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the King&#8217;s sake, they will enable their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King&#8217;s joy in ruling over the earth (25:21, 23).</p><p>26<sup>1</sup> In Luke 9:24-25 soul-life is replaced with himself, indicating that our soul-life is our self.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>I have learned to be afraid of my opinions.

In verse 23 Peter and Satan had become one in Peter&#8217;s selfish opinion. Peter&#8217;s opinion was Satan.</p><p>Nothing damages your Christian life more than your opinions.</p><p>The cross is not merely a suffering; it is also a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, first were crucified with Him and now bear the cross. To us, to bear the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man. In so doing we deny our self that we may follow the Lord....Ultimately, the pathway to glory is a matter of being terminated....Resurrection follows termination. When we keep ourselves under Christ&#8217;s termination, spontaneously there will be a reaction in our spirit. This reaction is resurrection....Before the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion the disciples followed Him in an outward way. But now, after His resurrection, we follow Him in an inward way.

By this Matthew shows that what the Lord wants is not the washing of hands but the eating of Him, the taking in of Him as food. The question is how we can be inwardly cleansed. In order to be cleansed from within, something must get into us, and the only way this can take place is by eating. As the nourishing food, the Lord Jesus is the best cleansing element.</p><p>When it comes to the matter of eating, we must be careful not to eat any leaven. In 16:1-12 what is crucial is not the temptation presented by the Pharisees and Sadducees, but the leaven. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees was their teaching (v. 12). God is endeavoring to put Christ, the bread of heaven, into His people, and the enemy is working to put in leaven as God&#8217;s children are taking in Christ. Those testing the Lord asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven (v. 1). Those who bring in leaven desire to see signs, miracles. But the Lord Jesus refused to show them such a sign. The pure bread, the pure Christ, does not perform signs. He Himself is the unique sign. The sign of Jonah (v. 4), the sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ, was the only sign to be given. Every miracle, every sign, must be based upon the principle of the crucifixion and the resurrection.</p><p>In 16:13-20 the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi in the northern part of the Holy Land that their thought might be released from the foggy religious atmosphere of Jerusalem and the Jewish religion. It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter (vv. 16-17). It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 18-19). The revelation concerning Christ is the rock upon which the Lord Jesus is building His church, and against this church the gates of Hades, the power of darkness (Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18) cannot prevail. The church revealed in Matthew represents the kingdom with its reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself (Matt. 18:17-18).</p><p>Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples His crucifixion and resurrection for the first time (16:21-27). The concept of bearing the cross in Matthew 16 is not that of suffering but of keeping the self under the termination of death. To remain there is to deny the self, bear the cross, and lose the soul-life (that is, lose the enjoyment of the soul in this age that we might gain it in the coming kingdom age). Resurrection follows termination. When we keep ourselves under Christ&#8217;s termination, spontaneously there will be a reaction in our spirit. This reaction is resurrection.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 13 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 16:28-17:1</h2><p class="bold">16:28 &nbsp;Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man <sup>1</sup>coming in His kingdom.</p><p class="bold">17:1 &nbsp;And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a <sup>1</sup>high mountain privately.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>28<sup>1</sup> This was fulfilled by the Lord&#8217;s transfiguration on the mountain (17:1-2).

His followers not only shared His being rejected by the Jews (13:53-58) but also were persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics (14:1-12). They were in a deserted place with Him in a situation of poverty, yet they were richly cared for by Him (14:13-21). When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through (14:22-34). At that point many sick ones were healed by touching Him (14:35-36), but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to heckle Him because His followers transgressed their tradition (15:1-20). Then His disciples followed Him to a Gentile region, where a demon possessed Gentile was healed (15:21-28). After that, they followed Him along the sea of Galilee and up the mountain, where all kinds of sick people were healed and the need of His followers and the crowd was again richly provided for in a barren wilderness (15:29-39). After that, both the fundamentalists and the modernists of that day came to tempt Him, and He indicated that He would die to be a unique sign to them (16:1-4). Then He charged His followers to beware of the leaven of both the fundamentalists and the modernists (16:5-12). After all that, He brought His followers to the border of the Holy Land, close to a Gentile land, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom (16:13-28). Finally, He brought them into glory in the manifestation of the kingdom (17:1-8).</p><p>Matthew 13:53-17:8 is a marvelous doctrinal section. Thirty-four years ago, I gave a message on this portion of the Word in Shanghai. I had just arrived there as a newcomer in the work with Brother Nee.

Nearly all the points in that message were the same as those covered in these messages on the pathway to glory.

In the past we pointed out that the Lord&#8217;s coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually. In a sense, the Lord will come back from heaven; but in another sense, He will come out of us. When He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming. According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification. When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</p><p>Now we must see what it means to be glorified. When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity....Outwardly, He was a man, but inwardly He was the very God....The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory. Thus, the glorious divine element was concealed within the human element of Jesus....In Christ&#8217;s transfiguration, His humanity was glorified; it was brought into God&#8217;s glory. Before that time, God was in Him, but His humanity was not in God&#8217;s glory. In His transfiguration His humanity was thoroughly saturated with His glorious divinity. In the coming manifestation of the kingdom, Christ will be like this. He will be the very Christ with both divinity and humanity, but His humanity will be soaked with His divinity.</p><p>The day is coming when we shall not only see this, but also experience it ourselves....Our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us....It is to be transfigured, not from without, but from within....Second Thessalonians 1:10 says, &#8220;When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed.&#8221; (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 585-587)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>3<sup>1</sup> Moses died and God hid his body (Deut. 34:5-6); Elijah was taken by God into heaven (2 Kings 2:11).

They were preserved by God so that they could be the two witnesses in the great tribulation (Rev. 11:3-4). Moses represented the law, and Elijah, the prophets; and the law and the prophets were the constituents of the Old Testament as a full testimony of Christ (John 5:39).

Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah. He is the One imparting the law of life into us. In other words, as our present, real, subjective Moses He is regulating us from within. Moreover, He is also our present and subjective Elijah, constantly speaking for God and speaking forth God within us. We must listen to Him.</p><p>[In verse 9] we see the principle that the manifestation of the kingdom can be revealed only in resurrection. Anyone who is not in resurrection is not qualified to see it. If we believe in resurrection and live in resurrection, we will be in glory, even though the manifestation of the kingdom has not yet come. When we live and walk in resurrection, we have the sense that we are in glory and that we can see the glorious manifestation of the kingdom. Thus, the manifestation of the kingdom can be revealed only to those in resurrection. For this reason, the Lord Jesus charged the disciples not to talk about His coming in His kingdom.</p><p>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that Elijah would come and restore all things (v. 11). This word indicates that the coming of the kingdom was not yet in full. In the future there will be a full manifestation of the kingdom....John the Baptist was Elijah, but he was not Elijah in full. The full coming of Elijah will take place in the future....In the Bible the fulfillment of prophecy is often like this.

Following this, the Lord spoke to His disciples the second time about His crucifixion and resurrection (17:22-23). Then we have the incident regarding paying the temple tax (17:24-27). As we read chapter seventeen, it may be difficult to understand the connection between all these things. If we would understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to remember that Matthew puts different facts together to reveal a doctrine.</p><p>We have pointed out that the coming of the kingdom in 16:28-17:2 was not the coming of the kingdom in full; it was simply a miniature and a foretaste. The prophecies concerning the manifestation of the kingdom have not yet been completely fulfilled. When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, out of the atmosphere of the manifestation of the kingdom, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom. Demon possession signifies the power of darkness. In the realm of the Lord&#8217;s transfiguration there is glory, but outside this realm there is the power of darkness. While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession. During an inspiring conference or training, we may have the sense that we are on the Mount of Transfiguration. However, when we return home, we realize that the power of darkness is still all around us. To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King (17:18). We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting [v. 21]. As the heavenly King, the Lord has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord&#8217;s authority.</p><p>[In verses 22 and 23 we have the second unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection.] The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration. Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection. Matthew specifically says that the disciples &#8220;were greatly grieved.&#8221; According to the concept of Peter, James, and John, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified. Thus, they might have said, &#8220;Christ has already been transfigured. Why does He still need to pass through crucifixion and resurrection?&#8221; Because the disciples had a mistaken concept, they were grieved at the Lord&#8217;s word.</p><p>We also may have times when we have a foretaste of the transfiguration. Afterward, however, we still need to descend from the mountain and bear the cross in the presence of our husband or wife. No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross. By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection.

In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the temple tax to the poll tax gatherers. This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ. In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God. From that time onward, Peter was certain that Christ was the Son of the living God. Following this, on the mountaintop he saw a vision of Christ manifested as the Son of the living God. Therefore, he both received the revelation and saw the vision. It is possible to have a revelation without having a vision. What Peter received from the heavenly Father in chapter sixteen was merely the revelation. In chapter seventeen he saw the Son of God manifested and expressed through the man Jesus of Nazareth. Nothing could have been more clear than this revelation and vision.</p><p>Peter, however, had to be tested regarding the application of the revelation and the vision. To receive the revelation and to see the vision is one thing, but to apply them in a practical way is another. For example, we probably all have received the revelation from Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us. Perhaps even the weakest one among us has received this revelation. However, when your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, can you still say, &#8220;It is not I, but Christ&#8221;? When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish. Very few who have received this revelation apply it to the practical matters in their daily living. Peter might have been like this. He might have said, &#8220;I have received the revelation that Jesus is the Son of the living God, and I saw Him transfigured on the mountain. This is very clear to me. Perhaps you have not seen this vision, but I have.&#8221; For Peter to receive the revelation and see the vision was wonderful. But now he had to be tested by those who collected the poll tax.</p><p>Verse 24 says, &#8220;And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?&#8221;...When Peter was asked this question, he immediately said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Peter did not know how to apply the revelation and the vision, and he was exposed....It is the same with us today.

Peter might have been considering this when the Lord charged him to catch a fish with a stater in its mouth and to use that stater to pay the tax. The tax had to be paid in order not to stumble others. We cannot subdue the Lord Jesus. Whatever He says is always right, and whatever we propose to Him is always wrong. Christ is today&#8217;s Moses; He makes the laws. When He says yes, the answer is yes; and when He says no, it is no. What we say means nothing. It is what He says that counts. The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves. Christ, not Moses, is the One to say yes or no. Regarding the same matter, the Lord may say yes to someone else and no to you.

Not many Christians realize that Christ&#8217;s transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom. According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification. When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</p><p>Now we must see what it means to be glorified. When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity. The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory. For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity. We may say that His humanity was soaked with divinity. This transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom.</p><p>As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ. Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah. He is the One imparting the law of life into us. In other words, as our present, real, subjective Moses He is regulating us from within. Moreover, He is also our present and subjective Elijah, constantly speaking for God and speaking forth God within us. We must listen to Him.</p><p>The coming of the kingdom in 16:28-17:2 was simply a miniature and a foretaste. When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom. While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession. To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King (17:18). We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting.</p><p>The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration; Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection. Hence, He unveiled His crucifixion and resurrection a second time (vv. 22-23). According to the disciples&#8217; mistaken concept, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified. Therefore, they &#8220;were greatly grieved&#8221; at His word. No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross. By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection.</p><p>In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the temple tax to the poll tax gatherers. This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ. On the mountain Peter talked too much, and he was rebuked for it. Now when the poll tax gatherers asked him whether or not the Lord paid the temple tax (v. 24), he still had too much to say and did not hesitate to answer. Peter had spoken presumptuously in both situations. Whatever the Lord Jesus says is always right, and whatever we propose to Him is always wrong. What we say means nothing. It is what He says that counts. The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 14 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 18:1-4, 6, 10</h2><p>1 &nbsp;In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest <sup>1</sup>in the kingdom of the heavens?</p> <p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst</p><p class="bold">3 &nbsp;And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p> <p class="bold">4 &nbsp;He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.</p><p class="bold">10 &nbsp;See that you do not despise one of these little ones...</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Chapters eighteen, nineteen, and twenty are a distinct section of the Gospel of Matthew dealing with the relationships among the kingdom people....We need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters. [These five matters are: pride, our inability to forgive others-the root of which lies in our dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition.] All these problems are within us. If we would get into the depths of these chapters, we would certainly be touched. For instance, we would see that we are people full of pride and that anger is hidden in our disposition. No matter how patient or forbearing we try to be, anger is still deeply rooted in our disposition. This is what makes it difficult for us to forgive others. Furthermore, we are troubled by lust and riches, both of which damage the kingdom life. Finally, there is the problem of ambition. Matthew purposely covers these five problems in his Gospel to show that we must take care of them in order to be in the kingdom. Pride, dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition are all &#8220;scorpions.&#8221; We need a divine pest control to kill these &#8220;scorpions.&#8221;</p><p>In the kingdom life, humility is required (18:1-4). In principle, all the kingdom people must be little children. To be humble is to be like a little child. If we are not humble, we will either be offended by others or we will offend others, that is, we will either be stumbled by others or stumble others. All stumbling takes place because of pride. If we were not proud, we would not be stumbled....If a little child is offended, the offense will be forgotten in just a few minutes. But once adults are offended, they are stumbled because of their pride. Furthermore, the stumbling we cause to others also issues from our pride.</p><p>It is a serious matter to stumble someone [v. 6]. In these verses the Lord warns us to deal with this matter. If the hand, the foot, or the eye causes us to stumble [vv. 8-9], we must deal with these causes of stumbling in a serious way....In order to be in the proper kingdom life, we need to be humble. Then we will not be stumbled or be a cause of stumbling to others. All stumbling must be abandoned.</p><p>No matter how small we are, we are lovely in the eyes of the Father, and He cares for us. He does not like to see anyone stumbled. We so easily offend the little ones for whom the Father cares, and as little ones ourselves we are easily stumbled. If we would avoid being stumbled and stumbling others, we need to be humbled. Humility will rescue us.

Such meetings of a few people must have been held in the believers&#8217; homes, as mentioned in Acts 2:46 and 5:42, for the purpose of prayer (Matt. 18:19; Acts 12:5, 12), fellowship, the breaking of bread, teaching, or the preaching of the gospel (Acts 2:42; 5:42). Many such meetings may be held separately in the same locality, yet they are still the unique church in that locality (Matt. 18:17).

The seriousness of this is shown by the danger of being cut off from the fellowship of the church. To be cut off from the fellowship of the church means to be put out of the kingdom life. This is serious.</p><p>In the Lord&#8217;s word about dealing with an offending brother, the authority of the kingdom is involved. Verse 18 says, &#8220;Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.&#8221;...If you consider verse 18 in its context, you will realize that it is not an insignificant matter to rebel against the church. The church simply follows the heavens to bind what the heavens have already bound. The church&#8217;s binding is the execution of the heavens&#8217; binding....The same is true regarding repentance....If you repent to the church, the heavens will immediately loose you, and then the church will loose what has been loosed in the heavens.</p><p>After listening to the Lord&#8217;s word about the kingdom life, Peter asked Him a question: &#8220;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?&#8221; (v. 21)....&#8220;Jesus said to him,...Up to seventy times seven&#8221; [v. 22]. Seventy times seven means that we must forgive others an unlimited number of times. There is no need to count or keep a record of the number of times you forgive others. Over and over and over, you need to forgive them. In verses 23 through 35 the Lord gives a parable as an illustration....According to the context of this parable, the settling of accounts here refers to the Lord&#8217;s dealing with us in this age through such things as severe illness or certain extreme hardships which cause us to realize how much we owe the Lord and to beg Him to forgive us.

He deals with a brother who has been offended, yet who is not willing to forgive.</p><p>In verses 15 through 20 the emphasis is on the offending brother needing to repent. But in the parable the emphasis is on the offended one needing to forgive. Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom...not only in this age but in the coming age....Perhaps you have not heard such a serious word before and were misled concerning this matter. Many Christians do not know how to interpret this part of the Word because they have not seen God&#8217;s dispensational administration. They do not realize that God has ordained three ages: the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age. According to Matthew 12:32, certain sins cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the coming age. This indicates that other sins can be forgiven in this age or in the next age.</p><p>If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be....This will annul the kingdom life and cause us to forfeit the church life. May the Lord grant us the grace we need. If I offend you, I need to go to you and repent. If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart. And once I have forgiven an offense, I should forget it and never mention it again. If we do this, we will have the proper kingdom life. Then we will share in the manifestation of the kingdom.

We need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters: pride, our inability to forgive others-the root of which lies in our dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition. All these problems are within us. We need a divine pest control to kill these &#8220;scorpions.&#8221;</p><p>Matthew 18 deals with the way we should live and act in the kingdom of the heavens: (1) we should become like little children (vv. 2-4); (2) we should not stumble others or set up any stumbling block (vv. 5-9); (3) we should not despise even a little believer (vv. 10-14); (4) we should hear the church and not be condemned by it (vv. 15-20); and (5) we should forgive a brother without limit (vv. 21-35).</p><p>All stumbling takes place because of pride. Humility will rescue us.</p><p>In both of its aspects, universal and local, the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose. If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile (the heathen) and the tax collector (the sinner), who are outside the fellowship of the church. Such a one is cut off from the fellowship of the church in order that this loss of fellowship may encourage him to repent and to recover his fellowship with the church.</p><p>In chapter eighteen we see how to deal with someone who offends others as well as the seriousness of offending others. In verses 15 through 20 the emphasis is on the offending brother needing to repent. But in the parable (vv. 23-35) the emphasis is on the offended one needing to forgive. Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom not only in this age but also in the coming age. If I offend you, I need to go to you and repent. If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart. If we do this, we will have the proper kingdom life and will share in the manifestation of the kingdom.</p><p>The religionists&#8217; temptation (Matt. 19:3) afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal that marriage life (vv. 3-12) and our attitude toward riches (vv. 16-30) are related to the kingdom of the heavens. Marriage life touches the matter of lust, and our attitude toward riches touches the matter of covetousness. The kingdom of the heavens rules out every trace of our lust and covetousness.</p><p>Matthew 19:16-26 reveals the way for a rich man to enter into the kingdom. To have eternal life (v. 16) in the Gospel of John is mainly for regeneration, for the new birth. But in the Gospel of Matthew, eternal life is for the kingdom. To enter into life here (v. 17) is to enter into the kingdom of the heavens (v. 23), a realm of God&#8217;s eternal life. This differs from being saved. When we are saved we receive God&#8217;s life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live and walk by God&#8217;s life. To live and walk by God&#8217;s life is to follow the Lord. To follow the Lord is to love Him above all things (10:37-38). This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 15 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 19:27-30</h2><p>27 &nbsp;Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You.

The first part is in this age, and the second part is in the coming age. The first part of the kingdom reward is mainly related to material things and natural things. If, for the kingdom&#8217;s sake, or for the sake of the Lord&#8217;s name, we leave all these things, the Lord will reward us a hundredfold. In verse 29 the Lord said, &#8220;Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name&#8217;s sake shall receive a hundred times as much and shall inherit eternal life.&#8221; To receive a hundred times as many houses, fields, and relatives is to be rewarded in this age (Mark 10:30). This refers to our enjoyment of brothers and sisters in the Lord, with their possessions.</p><p>In verse 29, the Lord also speaks of inheriting eternal life. To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age (Luke 18:29-30), in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age. In the manifestation of the kingdom, we will participate in the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom with the Lord Jesus. This will be greater than the first aspect of the kingdom reward, which we receive in this age.</p><p>In verse 28 the Lord said, &#8220;Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&#8221; The restoration is the restoration in the coming kingdom age (Acts 3:21), after the Lord&#8217;s second coming. In the coming kingdom the overcomers will sit on thrones to reign over the earth (Rev. 20:4). The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, and the other overcomers will rule over the nations (Rev. 2:26).</p><p>After hearing the Lord&#8217;s answer, Peter had nothing more to say. His mouth was shut. But the Lord went on to say, &#8220;But many first will be last, and many last first&#8221; (v. 30)....The Lord gave the parable in 20:1-16 to explain the meaning of this verse. The word &#8220;For&#8221; at the beginning of 20:1 indicates that this parable is an explanation of 19:30.</p><p>In order to understand 19:30 and the parable in 20:1-16, we need to see that Peter had a commercial mentality....Therefore the Lord said that many (but not all) who are first will be last, and the last first. This indicates that many, like Peter, who were the first would be the last to receive the reward. The Lord said this in order to revolutionize Peter&#8217;s commercial mentality. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter,...&#8220;Although you must pay in order to receive the reward of the kingdom, receiving the reward is not a commercial matter....The price you have paid means nothing.&#8221;</p><p>Actually, what we pay is refuse (Phil 3:8). Everything apart from Christ is dung. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter,...&#8220;Peter, all you have given up to obtain [the kingship] is dung....Although the price you pay is dung, I will reward you with the kingship.&#8221; Peter, who had a commercial mentality, needed to be reeducated by the Lord Jesus.

There is no unrighteousness with the Lord. He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy. Who were they to reply against the Lord? [Matt. 20:11-12]. But Peter&#8217;s natural concept, representing that of all believers, was commercial; he did not know the Lord&#8217;s gracious wish. Thus, he murmured against the Lord according to legality.</p><p>To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received....After receiving grace we must learn to enjoy grace.

The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration (16:13, 21). The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (17:22). This third time was on the way to Jerusalem. This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples; yet it would be fulfilled literally, in every detail.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>It seems to me rather unusual that after the definition of the kingdom reward the Lord would once again unveil His crucifixion and resurrection. Apparently this has no significance. However, if you get into the depth of this book, you will see that this is a very significant continuation. In order to receive the kingdom reward, we need to experience the cross and the resurrection....Apart from experiencing the Lord&#8217;s cross and resurrection, it is impossible to experience the Lord&#8217;s life for the reward of the kingdom. In Philippians 3 Paul said that for Christ&#8217;s sake he counted all things as refuse. Then he said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death. Paul had an adequate understanding of the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection. This understanding is for us to experience Christ as our life for the kingdom. For the kingdom reward, we need the experience of the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion and resurrection.</p><p>What was the disciples&#8217; reaction to the Lord&#8217;s full unveiling of His crucifixion and resurrection? They did not say, &#8220;Amen, Lord. The first and second times we didn&#8217;t see this. Thank You, Lord, for taking us aside this time and purposely telling us about this. Now we realize that You must pass through death and resurrection. No doubt this includes all of us. Eventually, we also shall experience this wonderful death and resurrection.&#8221; The disciples definitely did not react like this. Rather, verses 20 and 21 say, &#8220;Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him. And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.&#8221; The mother of the sons of Zebedee was the Lord&#8217;s aunt, His mother&#8217;s sister, and Zebedee&#8217;s sons, James and John, were His cousins. Thus, there was a natural relationship between them and the Lord. Immediately after the Lord had unveiled His death and resurrection for the third time, the mother of James and John came to Him asking that her two sons might sit on His right hand and left hand in the kingdom. Although the Lord had spoken of the crucifixion and the resurrection, their mind was set on the throne. Often we are exactly like James and John. Again and again they heard about the crucifixion and the resurrection. But in them and in their mother there was the desire for the throne. This is the ambition for position....This was their reaction to the Lord&#8217;s word about His death and resurrection.

The matter of the leading ones being slaves corresponds to the Lord&#8217;s word in [Matthew] 20:25 through 27....What is revealed in the Bible is absolutely different from our natural understanding....When our concept has been thoroughly revolutionized, the shame of ambition for position will be slain.</p><p>In 20:29-34 we have a record of the healing of the two blind men.

The lovers of Christ are not in Jerusalem, but in Bethany....We should not be the Jerusalem people, but the Bethany lovers.</p><p>Verse 19 says, &#8220;And seeing a fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only.&#8221;...At that time, the Lord Jesus came from God to Israel hungry for some fruit to satisfy God&#8217;s hunger. However, instead of fruit, He found only leaves. [Hence, He said to the fig tree, &#8220;May there no longer be fruit from you forever!&#8221; And the fig tree was instantly dried up.]</p><p>According to our experience, we can testify that first the meek King comes into us, and we welcome Him. However, He comes in not to be enthroned, but to cleanse the temple of God, because He cares for God&#8217;s house. Caring also for God&#8217;s satisfaction, He desires fruit from God&#8217;s people. But most of His people cannot afford Him any fruit. As a result, they are dried up....Whenever someone is dried up, his spirit does not function. Hence, there is no temple and no fruit, no proper worship and no satisfaction to God.

The kingdom reward is of two parts. The first part is in this age, and is mainly related to material things and natural things. The second part is in the coming age, in the manifestation of the kingdom, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age.</p><p>Peter said to the Lord, &#8220;Behold, we have left all and followed You. What then will there be for us?&#8221; (19:27). Therefore, the Lord said that many (but not all) who are first will be last, and the last first (v. 30). This indicates that many, like Peter, who were the first would be the last to receive the reward. The Lord said this in order to revolutionize Peter&#8217;s commercial mentality. Receiving the reward is not a commercial matter. Actually, the price we pay means nothing. What could we pay to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom? Actually, what we pay is refuse (Phil. 3:8). The reward is not a legal matter but a matter of grace. To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received.</p><p>Immediately after the Lord unveiled His death and resurrection the third time, the mother of James and John came to Him asking that her two sons might sit on His right hand and left hand in the kingdom. Although the Lord had spoken of the crucifixion and the resurrection, their mind was set on the throne. This is the ambition for position. If we ask to sit on the throne in the kingdom, we must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering. To suffer the cross is the way to enter into the kingdom (Acts 14:22).</p><p>Matthew 21 marks the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s last week on earth. The heavenly King came not with haughty splendor, but with gentle, humble meekness. This impression of meekness is strengthened by the colt accompanying a donkey to bear the meek King. The people honored the Lord with their clothing, that is, with whatever they had, and they spread palm branches in the road recognizing that He was the One with the victorious life.</p><p>When the Lord entered the city of Jerusalem, the first thing He did was cleanse the temple. His heart was not for His kingdom, but for God&#8217;s house. It is the same in principle with us today. On the day He came into us to be our life and our King, He did not enthrone Himself, but cleansed God&#8217;s temple, which today is our spirit, the habitation of God (Eph. 2:22). After the cleansing, the Lord healed the blind and the lame in the temple (Matt. 21:14). This indicates that His cleansing of the temple causes people to have the sight to see and the strength to move.</p><p>The Lord cursed the fig tree-a symbol of the nation of Israel-because it was full of leaves but fruitless, signifying that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show but had nothing that could satisfy God. The concern of the meek King is for God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s satisfaction.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p></body></html>
