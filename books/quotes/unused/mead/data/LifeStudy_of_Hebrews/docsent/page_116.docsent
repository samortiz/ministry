   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE LIFE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, this indestructible life is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This term, the life of God, is used only once in the entire Bible, in Ephesians 4:18, which says, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While the unbelievers are alienated, cut off, from the life of God, we are attached, joined to it, for God has pledged His life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The English word for this is articulated, meaning that a member of the body is pledged to another member.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The hand, for example, is articulated to the arm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not merely a positional matter but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the life of God has been articulated into our being, we are no longer alienated from God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a small thing that God s life has pledged itself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that the Lord will develop this more and more in the church life in the coming years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must forget all the human teachings that say we need good ethics and behavior and focus on what we really need the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This life is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tell me, are you a human being or a divine being?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way to answer this question is to say, Undoubtedly, I am a human being, but I am a human being with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should make a declaration to all the angels: Angels, don t you know that I have the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Angels, you don t have the divine life, but I do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have the life of your Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have the divine life!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing is better than life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the whole universe the best item is life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you were to take life away from the earth, this planet would be a desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The loveliness, pleasantness, and beauty of the earth all come out of one thing life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there were no life on earth, this planet would be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we have the highest life, not the vegetable life, the animal life, the angelic life, or even just the human life we have the divine life!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we saw this, we would be beside ourselves with joy and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The indestructible life is also the eternal life John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What does the term eternal mean?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A number of times the King James Version says everlasting life instead of eternal life, but this translation misses the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eternal life is not just everlasting life, although the matter of everlastingness is included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eternal life is a super life, a life without beginning or end, a life without the limitations of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eternal life is so high that it is beyond description; it far transcends our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine priesthood of Christ is constituted with such a life as this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE UNCREATED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indestructible life is the uncreated life John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every kind of life, from the angelic life to the vegetable life, is a created life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only the indestructible life is uncreated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although it is uncreated, it is creating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This life is always creating something positive in our church life, family life, and Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Day by day we may enjoy this creating, yet uncreated, life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is our life today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE LIFE WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indestructible life is just Christ Himself John 14:6a; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anything less than Christ, who is God Himself, is not the indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The indestructible life not only has functions and abilities it has a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to experience this life day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>V. THE LIFE WHICH HAS BEEN TESTED</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>IN CHRIST S HUMAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The indestructible life has been tested in Christ s human living John 18:38; 19:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This life was tested during Christ s thirty-three and a half years on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the end of the Lord s earthly life, Pilate, a governor of the Roman Empire, made the last three tests, and at the end of every test he declared, I find no fault in this man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Can you find another person concerning whom your conscience can say that he has no fault?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although my dear wife loves me very much, she would have to admit that she has found fault with me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe that every wife has found fault with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although none of us can stand the test, the Lord Jesus withstood every test.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The kind of life that we have today is a life that has passed through every test.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This life is perfect.</S>
