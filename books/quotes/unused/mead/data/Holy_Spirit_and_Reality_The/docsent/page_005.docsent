   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example Eight</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ v. 6 . This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christians say, "I know that my old man is crucified, but I do not know why my old man is still living today."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason for this is that they have touched a doctrine; they have not touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that if a doctrine is in letters and not in the Holy Spirit, we will not receive any life even if we know all about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we merely touch the doctrines of salvation, justification, and sanctification, what we have are merely letters, and they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A doctrine must be in the Holy Spirit before it can become a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we touch the spiritual reality, we touch life, and it is living and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person may seemingly deliver a very spiritual sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet what he says stifles others because he has not said the real thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a man touches reality, what he says will be real.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is reality that causes others to touch reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, even if there are extensive quotations and references, and even if all the logic is right, those who know reality will still say that it is not reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Example Nine</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another matter is the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who know Christ according to outward appearance do not really know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only real knowledge is the knowledge in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men seemed to touch Him, but actually they did not touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They seemed to know the Lord Jesus, but actually they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their knowledge was outward and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who truly knew the Lord Jesus were the ones who touched the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their knowledge was in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must consider a little more from the Bible concerning this point because this is a very basic experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men knew Him in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One was knowledge according to appearance, and the other was inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us first consider the meaning of knowing Him according to outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Jews knew the Lord Jesus according to His outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They held on to their presumptuous attitude from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 6:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were very confident.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since they knew His father and mother, they thought that they knew Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus came into His own country, they said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And are not His sisters here with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They knew not only the Lord's parents, but His brothers and sisters as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But did they really know the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although they knew the Lord's parents, they did not know the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although they knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They judged who the Lord was by His outward appearance, and they did not touch the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another group of people knew the Lord a little deeper than the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But they still did not know Him in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord was in Caesarea Philippi, He asked the disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They said, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets" Matt 16:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was much more advanced than the knowledge of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some said that the Lord was Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Elijah was a powerful prophet; he can be considered as a symbol of power.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus was indeed an Elijah; He was a most powerful prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Others said that the Lord was Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jeremiah was a weeping prophet; he can be considered as a symbol of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus was indeed a Jeremiah, one who was full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He rebuked the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, He repeated eight times, "Woe to you" 23:13-16, 23, 25, 27, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He saw some selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there, He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was truly an Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He was with the tax collectors and the sinners, He feasted with them Matt 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When He sat down in the house of Simon, He allowed a woman to weep over His feet Luke 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When He saw Mary weeping and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He sighed in His spirit, and wept also!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John 11:33, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was truly a Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But whether others called Him Elijah or Jeremiah, this knowledge was still outward knowledge.</S>
