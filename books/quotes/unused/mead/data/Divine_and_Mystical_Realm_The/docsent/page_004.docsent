   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Compound Spirit Typified by the Anointing Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, not one of today's theologies stresses adequately the critical point concerning the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment a compound of one hin of olive oil with four kinds of spices and their effectiveness in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life-giving Spirit is not simple but is a Spirit that has been compounded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last Adam was a man, and the life-giving Spirit is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, this Spirit must be a Spirit with two natures the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two natures have not only been mingled but have been compounded, as indicated by the type in Exodus 30:23-25, which records God's instructions for forming the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This ointment was not a single element but a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A single element cannot be an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The anointing ointment in Exodus 30 was a compound of one main item a hin of olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In typology, oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Flowing myrrh signifies Christ's death, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Calamus, a reed that grows in a marsh or muddy place, shooting upward toward the sky, signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Cassia signifies the repelling power and effectiveness of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Cassia is a kind of bark that was used as a repellent to repel snakes and insects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, cassia signifies the power, especially the repelling power, of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His resurrection has the power to repel Satan, the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four spices were compounded with the one hin of olive oil to become one ointment of five elements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With this compound ointment we have the number one one hin of olive oil signifying the one God and the number four four spices signifying man as God's creature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also have the number three, seen in the fact that the quantity of the spices involved three units, each of five hundred shekels: myrrh five hundred shekels; cinnamon two hundred fifty shekels; calamus two hundred fifty shekels; and cassia five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the amount of the spices consisted of three units of five hundred shekels, or five hundred shekels times three.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The number three signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we should note the second unit of five hundred shekels was split into two parts typifying Christ, the middle of the Divine Trinity, who was wounded on the cross , each of two hundred fifty shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, with this compound ointment we have the number five, formed by adding the one hin of olive oil and the four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number five is seen also in the five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Bible five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets, with five commandments on each tablet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 25 the ten virgins are divided into two groups consisting of the five wise ones and the five foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From all the foregoing we see that the numbers one, two, three, four, and five are all used in the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Old Testament type, which actually was a kind of prophecy, must have a New Testament fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The type of the anointing ointment was completely fulfilled in the life-giving Spirit, which was produced in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life-giving Spirit, who the last Adam became, contains Christ's divinity, His humanity, the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, and the power and effectiveness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life-giving Spirit is therefore the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment in the Old Testament.</S>
