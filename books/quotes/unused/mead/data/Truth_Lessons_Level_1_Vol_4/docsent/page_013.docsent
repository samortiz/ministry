   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the initial stage of God s full salvation the believers experience God s calling, the Spirit s sanctification, and their repentance, believing, being baptized, being joined to the Triune God, and being redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same stage the believers also experience their being regenerated, receiving the Holy Spirit, obtaining the eternal life, being renewed, being transferred, being freed, and thereby being made a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers being made a new creation is the most crucial part, even the lifeline, of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The believers are made a new creation first through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s redemption, including the forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation to God, is for the regeneration of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason God forgives us, washes us, sanctifies us, justifies us, and reconciles us to Himself is that we may be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our concept might have been that as long as we could be forgiven of our sins and be justified before God, we would have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, what God s salvation has accomplished includes much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through God s salvation we not only obtain an outward position that is acceptable to God, but we also are regenerated within to receive a life that is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I. THE NEED FOR REGENERATION A. Man Being of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man needs regeneration because man is born of the flesh and is of the flesh John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how we feel about ourselves, in reality we are from the flesh and of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That which is from the flesh and of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The flesh is born in sin Psa 51:5 and is from sin; it is sold under sin Rom 7:14 and is of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the flesh there is nothing good Rom 7:18 ; there is only wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flesh is weak and unprofitable in the things of God Rom 8:3; John 6:63 , and it is desperately wicked Jer 17:9 and incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the flesh is enmity against God; it is not and cannot be subject to the law of God, and it cannot please God Rom 8:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being estranged from the life of God Eph 4:18 , the flesh has nothing to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, the flesh cannot be changed Jer 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how much it is changed outwardly, its inward nature cannot be changed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No matter how it is changed, it is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The flesh is the flesh, and it can never be changed to spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, and only it can receive God s life and partake of the divine nature, escaping the corruption which is in the world by lust 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, man needs to be regenerated, that is, to be born of the Spirit, to be born of God, who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many think that man needs to be regenerated because man is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact is that man, whether good or evil, is from the flesh and of the flesh; hence, man needs to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be regenerated not only because our life is evil, but because our life is the life of the flesh, not the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if our life were good, it still would be the human life, not the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of how good and pure the human life might be, it still is not the divine life that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, man needs to be regenerated that he may receive God s life.</S>
