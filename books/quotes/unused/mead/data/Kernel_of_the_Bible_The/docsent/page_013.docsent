   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO STAGES OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The temple is also a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle was neither stationary nor permanent, but the temple was established.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some churches are good, but they, like the tabernacle, are not settled and solidly established.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Praise the Lord that some churches are the temple, fully settled and solidly established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to have such an established church, we must take Christ, not only as the manna, but also as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must take Christ as solid food, not just as the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>German bread is very hard, and babies cannot eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although babies might be able to eat manna, they cannot eat barley bread.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those in some local churches constantly eat manna.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although this is good, it is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all must pass through the wilderness and enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must progress from eating manna to eating hard bread.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must also experience Christ as the stone and as the iron and brass.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the stone to smash the enemy and to build the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How we need to experience Christ as the iron and brass for the defeat of the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some saints in the church life are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Day after day they eat manna.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when the enemy attacks, they are not able to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are young, immature, and not at all strong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But some of the saints are very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are like iron and brass.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Each of them is a rock that can smite the enemy, build up the temple, and even establish the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the Angel, Moses, the Lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the good land, including water, food, cattle, and minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is by experiencing Christ as the minerals in the good land that we become rock, iron, and brass.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we experience Christ in this way, we are good not only for the building, but also for fighting the battle, defeating the enemy, and subduing all the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the enemy and the adversaries are defeated, we have the ground for the building of the house of God and for the establishing of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once again we see that the church comes out of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen two stages of the church: the stage of the tabernacle and the stage of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is the church in your locality the tabernacle or the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would be very glad to hear that the church in your city is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have seen, the tabernacle is good, but it is not very solid or weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the temple is weighty, solid, and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order for the church to be the temple, a good number of saints must become stones, iron, and brass.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only by becoming iron and brass can we fight the battle and defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are the saints in your locality stones, iron, and brass, or are they wafers that are sweet, delicious, tender, and kind, but not at all solid?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you pour water on a wafer, it will easily fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if you pour water on stone, iron, or brass, no damage will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are solid and strong can stand against any storm or flood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are able to stand against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the church in the stage of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would have the church as the temple, we need to experience Christ as stone, iron, and brass, not simply as manna.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether the church is the tabernacle or the temple, the function, the foundation, and the nature are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both the tabernacle and the temple are unique.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There cannot be more than one tabernacle, and there cannot be more than one temple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tabernacle and the temple both come out of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we lack the experience of Christ, we simply cannot have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus far in this series of messages we have come to three stations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first station is at the end of Genesis, the second is at the end of Exodus, and the third is the building of the temple in 1 Kings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the time of 1 Kings chapter eight, God had gained an established temple on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God was able to put His name there, and He could fill it with His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praise the Lord that in Stuttgart and other places God has such a solid temple, a solid church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This temple is not built with wafers, but with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise the Lord that a good number of saints are stone, iron, and brass.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are strong to stand against the enemy, to express God, to be His dwelling place on earth, and to satisfy the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church.</S>
