   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX FOOT-WASHING 2 Date: October 15, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: John 13:1-17 FOOT-WASHING BEING A NECESSITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, foot-washing does not just refer to humility or to the washing away of our ordinary sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It mainly refers to maintaining a fresh relationship between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There should be no barrier between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot always practice the prayer of Matthew 6, shutting ourselves in our private room and praying with our doors shut.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to go out and contact the things and people of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, it is inevitable that we will defile our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our feet are defiled through our contact with the world, and this defilement becomes a barrier between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why foot-washing is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Foot-washing has nothing to do with our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The conscience is related to sin, and when there is sin, there is the need of the washing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Foot-washing has to do with our spiritual vitality; it is for rekindling our spiritual vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Believers do not sin all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet every believer has times when he or she is spiritually enervated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why we all need foot- washing for the recovery of our spiritual energy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TAKING OFF THE SHOES SIGNIFYING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ONE'S CONTACT WITH GOD'S HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to wash our feet, we must take off our shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible removing the shoes signifies one's contact with God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On Mount Horeb, Moses wanted to see the vision of the burning bush, but God said to him, "Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" Exo 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why did God ask Moses to take off his shoes?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was because he could not touch God's holiness directly unless he took off his shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, removing the shoes signifies one's contact with God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are two things that separate us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first is sin, which is taken care of by the Lord's blood in washing us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second are the things of this world, which are taken care of by the foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today many people do not know how precious it is to have the Lord's presence all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These people must have the blood-washing in their conscience before they are qualified to speak about the foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My word tonight is for those whose conscience have been washed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times our conscience has been cleared, yet we still feel a separation between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At such times there is the need of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Foot-washing sustains an intimate fellowship between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord loves us, and He loves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He gave Himself and shed His precious blood to redeem us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His great love also constrains Him to wash our feet so that there will be no barrier between us and Him, and we can continually draw nigh to such a holy God and enjoy His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE DEFILEMENT OF THE FEET</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SIGNIFYING SEPARATION FROM GOD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AS A RESULT OF CONTACT WITH THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have observed that many brothers have similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the morning they draw near to God and enjoy a sweet fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Heaven is so near to them that they can almost touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, they lose this inner taste by the time they go to work, especially in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though they are able to repeat the same intimate words of fellowship which they uttered in the morning to the Lord, the taste is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who have been through this experience know the pain that it brings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who have never been through this experience do not know what we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one sins, there are ways to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if one falls into this condition, it is very difficult to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The defilement of the feet is not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord never said that our feet cannot be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He only said that those who have bathed have no need except to wash their feet, but are wholly clean John 13:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For a Christian to sin is abnormal, but for him to have feet that are defiled is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one can avoid having his feet defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The barrier that comes from defiled feet is not a matter of sin, but the result of our normal contact with this world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to remove such a barrier, there is the need of foot-washing.</S>
