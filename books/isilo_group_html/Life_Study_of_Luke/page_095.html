After a number of aspects related to the jubilee have been covered, there is the need for us to know the way to enter into the jubilee, the way to enter into the kingdom of God. The record in 13:22-30 is according to Luke&rsquo;s way of putting various points together to show us aspects of the jubilee. Now he presents us a portion that reveals the way to enter into the kingdom of God as the jubilee.</p><p>Luke 13:22 and 23 say, &ldquo;And He was passing throughout the cities and villages, teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem. And someone said to Him, Lord, are there only a few who are being saved?&rdquo; Although this question is rather foolish or ambiguous, the Man-Savior answered it in a very clear way: &ldquo;Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able&rdquo; (v. 24). This is not merely to be saved; this is to enter into the full jubilee, to enter into the full enjoyment of the kingdom of God, not only in this age but also in the age to come.</p><p>In verse 25 the Lord continues, &ldquo;From the time when the Master of the house is risen and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock on the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and He will answer and say to you, I do not know you. Where are you from?&rdquo; Here the words &ldquo;I do not know you&rdquo; do not mean, &ldquo;I am not familiar with you. You are not known to Me.&rdquo; Instead, these words mean, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appreciate you, I don&rsquo;t approve you, I don&rsquo;t give you any praise.&rdquo;</p><p>In verses 26 and 27 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;Then you will begin to say, We ate in Your presence and drank, and You taught in our streets; and He will say, I tell you, I do not know where you are from; go away from Me, all you workers of unrighteousness!&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here refers to the Jews and indicates that what the Jews were doing was unrighteous.</p><p>In verse 28 the Lord says, &ldquo;There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth there when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you being cast outside.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;weeping&rdquo; indicates regret, and &ldquo;gnashing of teeth&rdquo; indicates self-blame. The Lord&rsquo;s word about being outside the kingdom of God refers to the future, to the millennium. During the millennium, many Jews will be cast out of the kingdom of God.</p><p>In 13:23 the Jews asked about salvation. But the Lord answers concerning participation in the kingdom of God in the millennium, which will be the most enjoyable part of God&rsquo;s full salvation before the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-3a, 5-7; 22:1-5).</p><p>Verses 29 and 30 conclude, &ldquo;And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. And behold, there are the last who will be first, and there are the first who will be last.&rdquo; In verse 29 &ldquo;they&rdquo; refers to the Gentiles. Gentiles will come from east and west and from north and south and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. This will take place in the kingdom age, in the millennium. In verse 30 the &ldquo;last who will be first&rdquo; refers to the saved Gentiles, who will receive the Savior before some of the saved Jews and will participate in the kingdom of God in the millennium. The &ldquo;first who will be last&rdquo; refers to the believing Jews who will believe in the Lord later than the Gentile believers (Rom. 11:25-26). The word in this verse is applied in another sense in Matthew 19:30; 20:16; and Mark 10:31.</p><h2 class="head1">JOURNEYING UNINTERRUPTEDLY<br />TOWARD JERUSALEM</h2><p>In 13:31-35 we have a description of the Man-Savior journeying uninterruptedly toward Jerusalem. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you.&rdquo; This is a threat made by the opposers in their jealousy. But, as we shall see, the Lord was not threatened.</p><p>The Lord said to them, &ldquo;Go and tell this fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected&rdquo; (v. 32). The Greek words translated, &ldquo;I am perfected&rdquo; may also be rendered &ldquo;end My course&rdquo; or &ldquo;reach My goal.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s response indicates that He had a set schedule to carry out His ministry, to end His course, and to reach His goal, through His death and resurrection, and that no one, especially not Herod, could stop Him from accomplishing it.</p><p>Here the Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;I shall reach My goal. I shall accomplish what I intend to do. I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow and then on the third day, in resurrection, I will be perfected and reach My goal. Don&rsquo;t bother Me or threaten Me. I am the sovereign One, and you can do nothing. Who is Herod? He is a fox. You may be afraid of him, but I am not, because he is under Me. Tell him that I have My schedule. According to this schedule, I will finish My work, reach My goal, and be perfected.&rdquo;</p><p>In verse 33 the Lord said, &ldquo;However, I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day, because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.&rdquo; The Lord was not prevented by the threat from journeying to Jerusalem to accomplish His redemptive death. Rather, He was bold to proceed there (Mark 10:33) to reach the goal of His ministry.</p><p>In verse 33 the Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;I must journey today, tomorrow, and the following day because it is necessary for Me to die in Jerusalem. It is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem. Do not interrupt Me or frustrate Me. I have a goal, and My goal is to die in Jerusalem. I am on the way to reach My goal.&rdquo;</p><p>In 13:34 and 35 the Lord says, &ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you did not want to! Behold, your house is left to you. And I tell you, you shall by no means see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo; It has always been God Himself who cared for Jerusalem like a bird fluttering over her young (Isa. 31:5; Deut. 32:11-12). Hence, when the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I desire to gather your children together just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings,&rdquo; He indicated that He was God Himself.</p><p>In verse 35 the Lord says, &ldquo;Behold, your house is left to you.&rdquo; Since &ldquo;house&rdquo; is singular, it must denote the house of God, the temple (19:46-47). It was the house of God, but now it is called &ldquo;your house&rdquo; because they had made it a den of robbers.</p><p>In verse 35 the Lord also says, &ldquo;You shall by no means see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo; This will be the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, when the remnant of Israel will turn to believe in Him and be saved (Rom. 11:23, 26).</p><p>In 13:31-35 the Lord refers to His resurrection and to His coming back. When the Lord returns, He will bring in the jubilee. Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord, the One who will bring in the enjoyment of the jubilee in the millennium!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_094.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_096.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Luke &nbsp; pg 95</div><br></body></html>
