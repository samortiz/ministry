<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Purifying and Transforming</H2><P>[First Peter 2:4 and 5 say, "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house" (Gk.). The way for us to become living stones is to come to Him and to be seen by Him. As the Lord enlightens and judges us, He looks at us, and His seven eyes transfuse Himself into us. In this way we are transformed.]</P><P>[Even now, Christ's burning eyes are flaming over us to enlighten, search, refine, and judge us, not that we might be condemned, but that we might be purged, transformed, and conformed to His image for God's building. The Lord's judgment is motivated by love. Because He loves the church, He comes to search, enlighten, judge, refine, and purify us in order to transform us into precious stones. Eventually, this book [of Revelation] consummates in the New Jerusalem which is built with precious materials. Where do these materials come from? They come from the seven eyes of Christ, that is, from the life-giving, transforming Spirit. </P><P>In the book of Revelation the Spirit is not called the life-giving Spirit or the transforming Spirit, but the seven Spirits which are the seven burning, searching, judging lamps. For the degraded church, the Spirit who gives life must be the sevenfold burning Spirit. Today, the life-giving Spirit must be the flaming Spirit, and the transforming Spirit must be the searching and judging Spirit. His searching and judging are His purifying and transforming. No one can be transformed into a precious stone without being searched by Him. How I look to the Lord that He would search us all. We are not here for doctrine and teaching; we are here under the enlightening of the pure Word and under the searching of the seven Spirits. We all need to be thoroughly searched, purified, and refined. If we are, we shall never be the same.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>In the final book of the Bible, Revelation, the Spirit is called the "seven Spirits of God." This does not mean that there are seven different Spirits; rather this means that the Spirit of God is intensified seven times for God's move. The seven Spirits are also the seven lamps for shining and judging. They are also the seven eyes of the Lamb to observe and transfuse the believers with Christ's element. The seven Spirits which are the lamps and the eyes are for God's building. The sevenfold Spirit purifies, infuses and transforms the believers to make them precious stones fit for the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>If there are not seven different spirits, why is the Spirit of God referred to as the seven Spirits?</li><li>What is the significance of the number seven?</li><li>Why does the Holy Spirit need to be intensified sevenfold?</li><li>Besides Revelation 4:5, where else are the seven lamps of the lampstand mentioned?</li><li>What is the function of the seven eyes?</li><li>How do Exodus 25, Zechariah 3 and 4, and Revelation 4 relate to God's building?</li><li>Who is the stone in Zechariah 3:9?
