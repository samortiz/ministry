   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WALKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT CHAPTER ONE DANGERS IN THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Christian life, nothing is more crucial than to walk daily according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This will always keep the believer spiritual, keep him from the power of the flesh, keep him following the will of God, and keep him from Satan's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we know the function of the spirit, it is very important to walk according to it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a minute by minute matter, and we must not be at all slack concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be extra cautious about receiving the teachings of the Holy Spirit but not following His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many believers have failed, and this is the reason for their failure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just receiving the teaching is not enough; following His leading is a must.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should never be satisfied with spiritual knowledge; we must treasure the matter of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We often hear talk about "the way of the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What really is the way of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is none other than walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because in order to walk according to the spirit, all self-will, love, and thoughts must be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To follow the intuition and revelation of the spirit requires us to bear the cross daily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps all spiritual believers know something about the functions of the spirit as we mentioned earlier, but what they know does not last.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They only sometimes have spiritual experiences because they still do not clearly understand all the functions and laws of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, they do not know how to follow the spirit in a lasting manner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After hearing this truth, their experience may testify that it is true.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regrettably, however, they cannot experience this continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If their intuition had sufficient growth, they could always walk according to the spirit and not be affected by the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Note: everything outside of the spirit is the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many believers, due to their lack in understanding the law of the spirit, consider a life that is according to the spirit to be vacillating, standardless, and hard to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many believers have determined to do the will of God and follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit given in the spirit, yet they lose the boldness to come forward because they are uncertain of the trustworthiness of the intuition's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because they have not yet learned to apprehend the mind of the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not know the intent of all the feelings of the intuition whether to have them act or stop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neither do they know the proper condition of the spirit; therefore, they cannot receive continual guidance from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By not maintaining the spirit in the proper condition, they often cause the spirit to lose its working power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes they receive a revelation from the intuition, but they do not know why it is given at a particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They also do not understand why they fail to receive any revelation when they diligently seek at other times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not know the reason for this failure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They receive the revelation of the spirit because they sometimes unconsciously walk according to the law of the spirit; at other times, they cannot obtain the revelation because their seeking is not according to the law of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they could always walk according to the law of the spirit as they did unconsciously, they would always receive the leading of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But they do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we wish to obtain revelations in spirit, know the will of God, and do what is pleasing to Him, we cannot afford to be ignorant of the law of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the feelings of the spirit are meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to discover their meaning before we can act according to the spirit's requirements and walk continually according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Understanding the law of the spirit is indispensable to walking according to the spirit.</S>
