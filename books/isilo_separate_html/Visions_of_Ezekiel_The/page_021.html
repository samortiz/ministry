Out of the experience of all these things comes the wheel. According to Ezekiel 1, by the side of every living creature there is a wheel. The wheel is so high that it is dreadful. It is dreadfully high. We all realize that a wheel is for moving, not in an ordinary way, but in a special way. When we are at home and we walk from the kitchen to our bedroom or to our living room, we do not need a wheel. But, when we travel a distance, we need a wheel. When we do something to fulfill a purpose, we need a wheel. Therefore, the move by a wheel is not an ordinary move, but a special move with a purpose. The wheel implies a move with a purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO EXPRESS THE LORD</H2><P>The four living creatures are the manifestation and expression of the Lord in a corporate way. In every way they express the Lord. Because the Lord on the throne looks like a man, the four living creatures expressing Him also look like a man. Because the Lord on the throne looks like burning fire, the four living creatures also look like burning fire. This tells us that the living creatures are the expression of the Lord. Whatever the Lord is, they express. Because the Lord is living, they are living. The Lord Jesus is the living God, and they are the living creatures. The Lord Jesus looks like a man, and they also look like a man. The Lord Jesus looks like burning fire, and they also look like burning fire. They are the expression of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOR THE MOVE OF THE LORD</H2><P>In these verses the four living creatures are not only for the expression of the Lord, but also for the move of the Lord. The Lord Jesus moves on the earth by them. Whenever a church is proper and truly expresses the Lord, having the proper coordination with the fire going up and coming down, the move of the Lord will be with that church. If a church claims to be proper and yet has no move of the Lord, something is wrong. If there is no increase in number year after year and no growth in life among the members, it indicates there is no move with that church, and it indicates there is something wrong with that church. If a church is proper, it will have a great wheel at its side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MANIFEST TO ALL</H2><P>If a local church has a wheel, there is no need for it to claim that it has a wheel. Everyone will see its move. Its claim to having some move of the Lord may indicate that it does not actually have a move of the Lord. No one needs to declare or testify, "look at the move of the Lord among us." If there is a move, it will be manifest to all. Everyone can see the great wheel, high and terrible. The wheel is at the side of the living creatures for all to see. If we have a wheel that is high and dreadful, there is no need to claim that we have a wheel. The wheel is simply there. Every local church needs to have such a high and dreadful wheel beside it.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
