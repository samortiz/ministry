<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SUBMISSION<br />TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">First Finding Out the Deputy Authority</h2><p>Witness Lee: How can one see the authority of the Body?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The submission of some people seems to be selective. In order to practice submission, the first thing to ask is who is above me. When we go to work in the secular world, we should first ask who the boss is. If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished. The same principle applies to working in an office or in an institution. The first thing that comes to the mind of many people when they sit down is how to be the boss. These people need to learn a serious lesson of submission. Submission is a lesson that a man has to learn before God. We have to be disciplined to such an extent that we bear a submissive nature. Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is.</p><p>For example, the brothers and sisters who are staying at our guest houses have to submit to the authority in that house. When they come to the meeting, they have to submit to the ushers and have to sit where they are told to sit. Every house that you stay in has its own authority. A Christian should learn to look for authority and to submit to authority. All those who pretend to be the head do not know what headship means in the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission without Any Preference</h2><p>I have never seen a man who knows the Head yet does not submit to Christ's deputy authority. A person who knows the Lord will never be selective in the matter of submission. For example, Brother Witness's children cannot be selective in their submission to their father. If a brother or a sister has not learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception. The Bible says that there is no authority except from God (Rom. 13:1).</p><p>There are very few places in the Bible that speak of direct submission to God. Most of the time the Bible speaks of submission to man. Wherever you go, you have to submit, not criticize freely with your lips. If others give you some special authority, that is up to them. Nevertheless, you have to learn to submit. Many people have never learned the lesson. Wherever they go, they tear down the authorities, and they do not bridle their tongues. This kind of person is rebellious. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will not be wild Christians. Not only should we not be selective in our submission, but we should actively seek after the ones we should submit to.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission to Authority<br />Being the Nature of the Lord's Life</h2><p>When I was staying in London, everything was set up by the host. In the morning we woke up at six o'clock. At noon we had our meal. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we had our afternoon tea. One Swiss brother from Japan shook his head and sighed every day. I asked why he was so unhappy. He was fifteen years older than I was, and he made tens of thousands of pounds every year. He had a few thousand workers working under him. He told me that he was having a hard time because he had not been a student for over twenty years. At the guest house where he was staying, the brother in charge was a rather uneducated person. It was very unpleasant for this Swiss brother to come under that brother's supervision. I stayed in London for eighteen months. If I had not learned submission, but instead criticized and opposed, how could I have been happy within? Submission is the nature of the Lord's life. It is for our protection to submit to God's authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning Submission in the Church</h2><p>A Christian should learn coordination, and coordination comes from submission. A rebellious and independent person is one who will not be coordinated. Christians should learn to submit one to another and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct. Not only should a person have the realization of authority in the church and in the Body, but when he is alone, he should still have this realization. We learn submission first in the church. It is rather difficult to learn submission outside the church. It is more natural to learn submission in the church. This is God's protection; it keeps us from exposing ourselves. If we learn the lesson this way, the spirit of antichrist will be removed from us.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT</h2><p>Concerning submission to our government, we know that no Christian can overturn any government. If certain political factors are contrary to our faith, the most we can do is escape. It is like what the Lord says, that we escape from one city to another. In the Bible escaping is not a shameful thing to do. If a government is not good, we can escape. But at the same time, all Christians should still pray for the governments that are not good.</p><p>One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We still have to keep them. But under certain circumstances, there are laws which a Christian cannot keep. Brother D. M. Panton once said that if a law is itself unlawful, we do not have to consider whether or not to keep that law. For example, Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrews to kill their male children. The midwives did not obey this order, yet the Bible says that God dealt well with them (Exo. 1:20). Moses' mother did not obey the order of Pharaoh (2:1-2), yet Hebrews 11 praised her faith. This is because Pharaoh's law was itself a lawless order. In the New Testament Peter and John were acting under the same principle when they disobeyed the order of the high priest.</p>
