   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All those who try to manipulate do so in order to evade and avoid difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the more you try to evade and avoid, the harder it is for you to deal with the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you cannot confront them, it is better to leave them alone and allow them to surface by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no need for you to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you keep yourself genuine, many times difficulties will go away by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I especially like the man Moses in the book of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He never manipulated anything among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to admit that he had a great mind, and he was a man full of wisdom, insight, knowledge, and capability.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In spite of this, you see him as a very simple person among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was a genuine person, and he had an honest heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some say that a simple person is a foolish one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We admit that this is true, but please remember this kind of foolishness is not bad foolishness, but good foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must learn to have a heart that is honest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some elders are obviously unhappy with a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet they would not say so face to face, but would speak behind the person's back.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not being honest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you cannot say something before his face, you should not say it behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you cannot say it in the light, neither should you say it in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Elders must learn to be honest to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not wrong if you cannot say something face to face, for the environment or condition may not permit it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we must learn to live before God, because sometimes even God would not allow us to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But it is absolutely not right for you not to say something before a certain person's face, yet say it before others, or to paint a white picture in front of one person, yet paint a black one in front of another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the elders who are a profit to the church are truthful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I can speak something and I have the inner guidance to say it, I should say it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if I cannot speak something and do not have the inner guidance to say it either, I should not say it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that I say should be the same regardless to whom I say it whether to man, to God, or even to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This type of honest person never fears confrontation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He speaks the same word to those who oppose him as to those who agree with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He never fears confronting two opposing parties.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers, do not think this lesson is easy to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe all of you desire to serve the Lord, and none of you are dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this refers to honesty in the general sense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The honesty we speak of today means more; it means to be without any skirting of issues or manipulating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I must learn only to be restrained by God and to live before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When it is yes, I say yes; when it is no, I say no. When it is permissible, I do it; when it is not permissible, I will not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, whatever I do in public, I do the same in private.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the honesty of which we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only this kind of a heart can render the church real profit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The administration of the church is not a matter of speculation; you cannot play politics and think that as long as you are successful, nothing else matters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will not work; it will never withstand the test of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are a two-faced person, others may not know it at the time, yet given time, all will know.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Time is the proof of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order for the church to profit, an elder must learn to be a person with an honest heart.</S>
