<h2 class="head2">B. Human Experience</h2><p>The second major step in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was His experience of human life. As a man He lived in a lowly home (cf. Isa. 53:2) and lived among the human race for over thirty years. He came in contact with various kinds of people: the moral (John 3:1), the immoral (John 4:17-18), the dying (John 4:47), the sick and impotent (John 5:5), the hungry (John 6:26-27), the thirsty (John 7:37), those under the bondage of sin (John 8:3, 34), the blind (John 9:1), and even the dead (John 11:39). He also experienced human sufferings, sorrows, despisings, rejections (Isa. 53:3), trials, and temptations (Heb. 2:18; 4:15), and He even wept (John 11:35). He passed through all these tests. It is in His humanity with divinity that He passed through all the things of the human life.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Death</h2><p>The third major step in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was death (1 Cor. 15:3). His death was the death of a God-man, an all-inclusive death. He died as One with a sevenfold status: the Lamb of God (John 1:29), a man in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), the brass serpent (John 3:14), the old man in Adam (1 Cor. 15:45a), the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), the Peacemaker (Eph. 2:14), and a grain of wheat (John 12:24). His death terminated all the negative things in the universe: sins, the flesh, the Devil&mdash;the old serpent&mdash;with the world belonging to him, the old man, the old creation, and all the separating ordinances and customs; His death also released His divine life to us. Thus He accomplished His eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12; 10:12).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Resurrection</h2><p>The fourth major step of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was that He rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:4). His resurrection was God&rsquo;s vindication and approval of Him and His work to be a proof of our justification before God (Rom. 4:25); it was also a mark of His universal success. His resurrection demonstrated that He triumphed over Satan, death, Hades, and the grave (Heb. 2:14; Acts 2:31). Through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to impart God&rsquo;s life to us (John 3:15) and regenerate us (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, having nullified death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in His resurrection (2 Tim. 1:10).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Breathing the Spirit of Life into the Believers</h2><p>The fifth major step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments was that in resurrection He came back to the disciples and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit essentially (John 20:22), who is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the life-giving Spirit whom He has become in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b), to be their life and the essence of the new creation (1 John 5:12; 2 Cor. 5:17).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Ascension</h2><p>The sixth major step of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was that He ascended and sat at the right hand of God, far above all in the universe (Mark 16:19; Eph. 1:20-21), was made both Lord and Christ by God (Acts 2:36), and became the Head over all things and the Head of the church (Eph. 1:22; Col. 1:18).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Pouring Out the Spirit of Power<br />upon the Believers, Baptizing Them into His Body</h2><p>The seventh major step of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was that He poured out the Spirit of power economically after His ascension (Acts 2:33), first on the day of Pentecost, baptizing the Jewish believers into the Spirit (Acts 2:4), and later in the house of Cornelius, baptizing the Gentile believers into the Spirit (Acts 10:44-45). By these two steps He baptized all the believers once for all into the Spirit and into His one Body (1 Cor. 12:13).</p><p>All these seven items of His accomplishments were accomplished once for all and have become accomplished facts.</p>
