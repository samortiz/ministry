<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CHURCHES IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:1; 6:16; 8:1, 18-19, 23-24; 11:8, 28</H1><P>As we have pointed out, 2 Corinthians is an improvement over the first book in the experience of Christ, in the spirit, and in the church. Furthermore, the gifts spoken of in the first book are replaced by the ministry in the second book. In this chapter we want to see the churches in 2 Corinthians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED TO IMPROVE BY KNOWING THE CHURCHES</H2><P>We all must improve from knowing the church in a general way, or a so-called universal way, to knowing it in a local, specific, and practical way. Many Christians do not know anything about the church. Some Christians know something about the church, yet they know only about the universal church. But there is a small number of Christians who not only know the church but also know the local churches.</P><P>The universal church is more or less something in doctrine, in teaching, and in theory. But the churches are the practicality of the universal church. Many Christian teachers have spoken many messages and have written many expositions on the book of Ephesians regarding the church. Of all the expositions that have been written regarding the church, the majority are on Ephesians. But when we move from Ephesians to 2 Corinthians, we move from the church to the churches. There are very few expositions on the book of 2 Corinthians. The church, we may say, is the ABCs, while the churches are more advanced. Some have said that 2 Corinthians shows us the sufferings of the apostle Paul. This is true, but they do not see the reason that Paul suffered. Paul was suffering for the churches. You may have been taught about the church, but have you ever been taught about the churches? To know the churches is a great improvement. Some of us may know the church only in a doctrinal, general, weak, and even vague way. But we do not know the churches in a practical, particular, and specific way. We need to go on from knowing the church in Ephesians to knowing the churches in 2 Corinthians.</P><P>The word churches, in the plural number, is used many times in the book of 2 Corinthians. In Ephesians there is only the church in the singular number, not the churches. In 2 Corinthians 1:1, the church is mentioned in the singular number, but that is the church which is at Corinth, not in the universe. Besides this verse, all the references to the church in this book are in the plural number&#151;churches. Verse 1 of chapter eight refers to the churches in Macedonia. Verse 18 of the same chapter mentions a brother who was praised in the gospel throughout all the churches, and verse 19 says that this brother was chosen by the churches. In verse 23 we read of the messengers, or apostles, of the churches, and in verse 24 the Corinthians were exhorted to show before the churches the proof of their love. In 11:8 Paul said that he robbed other churches, and in verse 28 that he bore anxiety for all the churches. He had many burdens that pressed upon him daily, and they were the care for all the churches. In 12:13 Paul asked the Corinthians if they were inferior to other churches. It is all the time the churches, not the church.</P>
