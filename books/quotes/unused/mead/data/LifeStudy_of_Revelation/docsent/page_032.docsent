   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY TO SEE GOD S REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND TO REALIZE GOD S MANIFESTATION A. To Be Separated unto God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To see God s revelation and to realize His manifestation, we need to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle John was fully separated unto God on the island of Patmos 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was also brought to the open door of heaven 4:1 and to a great and high mountain 21:10 , and thus saw God s revelation and realized God s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, many Christians who are talking about the church do not see the local churches, mainly because they are not separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. To Be in the Human Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 1:10 says, I was in spirit on the Lord s day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The book of Revelation not only stresses the Spirit of God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God s intensified move, but also our human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only our spirit can respond to God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The book of Revelation is composed of four major visions: the vision of the churches ch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 3 ; the vision of the destiny of the world ch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4 16 ; the vision of the great Babylon ch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>17 20 ; and the vision of the New Jerusalem ch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To see these four visions, John was in his spirit 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10 , as mentioned in Ephesians 3:5 by the Spirit should be in spirit, Gk. for the revelation of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also need to be in our spirit to see the visions of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not merely a matter of mental understanding, but of spiritual realization.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first vision of this book, the vision concerning the churches, both Christ and the messengers of the churches are unveiled with the churches as never before, and this in a most particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this the believers need a particular vision in their spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s day in this verse should be the first day of the week, the day the Lord was resurrected John 20:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The early church used to meet on this day Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was on this day that John was in spirit to see the visions of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To see the revelation of the local churches, we need to turn from our reasoning mind to our seeing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Remaining in the reasoning mind confuses the vision of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. To Hear the Lord s Voice</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If Christians only understand the doctrine concerning the local churches, they may not see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All Christians need to hear the voice, the present and living speaking of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s voice directs us to the vision of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>D. To Turn to the Lord s Voice</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 1:12 says, And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and having turned I saw seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To see anything requires the right position with the right angle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostle John firstly heard the voice v. 10 , and when he turned to see the voice, he saw the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was rightly positioned, but he still needed the right angle to see the vision concerning the churches; thus, he turned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians need to be adjusted in their position and turned that they may see the vision of the churches.</S>
