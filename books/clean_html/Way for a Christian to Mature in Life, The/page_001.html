<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book is a collection of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei in 1955. It contains fourteen messages that show us that the way for a Christian to mature in life is by allowing God to build Himself into him, by paying the price before God, by being watchful and ready, by turning to the spirit, and by giving the ground to the Lord.</p>
