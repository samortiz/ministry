   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I would like to relate something that happened with this brother to show you how Brother Nee suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day a learned man was saved among us, and he desired to be baptized before he left China for the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee was so clear about this newly saved one, and he agreed that this man should be baptized before he left China.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the brother who had been a postmaster did not agree with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee asked this co-worker what he was concerned about.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that he was concerned that this new one might not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then Brother Nee said that if something was mistaken, he would be willing to bear all the responsibility before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The co-worker still would not agree to this new one being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Nee had shared previously in some messages that in the church life we always need the fellowship and that we should not do things individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because Brother Nee insisted on doing everything in fellowship, he would not baptize this new one without the co-worker's agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the new one left China without being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is just one of the cases of Brother Nee's suffering because of the immaturity of those with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would like to relate another case of his suffering in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have shared that Brother Nee picked up many positive things from the different practices in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the beginning of the church life, he picked up the way to have our meetings mostly from the practice of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why some people called us the Chinese version of the Brethren movement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the beginning, we practiced our meetings more than seventy percent according to the Brethren way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the meetings of the Brethren, the sisters were not allowed to utter anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were allowed to sing, but they were not allowed to speak or even to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By 1933 when I came into the work, Brother Nee realized that not having the sisters pray in the meetings was a big loss to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He became clear that it is absolutely right for the sisters to pray in the meetings see 1 Cor 11:5 and note 2 of 1 Cor 14:34 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The leading sisters agreed with Brother Nee, but most of the so-called leading ones believed that the sisters should not utter anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee fellowshipped with them that we should release the sisters in the meetings to pray, but nearly all the brothers said "no."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Brother Nee proposed this, I said "amen," but I was considered by the others as a newcomer who did not know much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is another example of Brother Nee's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The beginning of the practice of the church life in China was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Nee was the "first traveler" who paid the price to cut the way for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now that the cutting has been accomplished, it is easy for us to travel on the "road" of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee was the "road cutter."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He placed me so close to him in the work because he was lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the Lord's mercy, my spirit was strong to say "amen" to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That became a joy to him in the midst of his suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that we would learn the spiritual lessons through this fellowship.</S>
