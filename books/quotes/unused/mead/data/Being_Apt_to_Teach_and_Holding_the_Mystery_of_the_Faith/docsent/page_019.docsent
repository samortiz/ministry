   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX A FEW QUESTIONS CONCERNING REVELATION AND RELIGION SERVING ACCORDING TO REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose a person already has the concept of serving God before he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then after he believes in the Lord and is saved, he begins to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is such a service according to religion or according to revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To determine whether someone's service is according to revelation or religion, we need to determine whether or not his service comes from the teaching and revelation of the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes a person's service originates from both his religious concept and the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all were born in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were born with religious concepts, and these concepts have been deeply rooted in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the revelation of the Scriptures is working in us to get rid of our religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nothing hinders the true revelation more than religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Day after day the life of Christ is growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When that life is lived out of us, love is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This love is much higher than man's love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's love in its best condition is like copper; it cannot be like gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the love that issues from our living in Christ is a "golden" love the unchangeable, eternal, divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The love that issues from our living in religion is not the real love, the "golden" love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, it is like copper or, even worse, dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the love that issues from our living in Christ is the real love, the love that is of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To love people according to religious concepts is pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the love of a politician.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes people polish copper until it is shiny and looks like gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then they offer it to us, saying that it looks like gold and is just as good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we should ask ourselves whether we want copper or gold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we want gold, then we must not be fooled into accepting copper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we avoid being fooled?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Remember that whatever is according to religion and not according to revelation is false and deceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even our meeting together is not exempt from the possibility of being according to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not gather together because of human factors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we meet together because of a few responsible ones or because of a preacher, we are accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are taking this way today because we have seen that this is the Lord's way and the Lord's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if all the leading ones were to leave to pursue the world, even if they all fell in this way, we would still stand on this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether we stand on this ground or not does not depend on anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it depends directly on God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not according to Human Affection or Outward Things</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord's recovery was first raised up, we were exercised to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We did not give favors to people in order to gain their acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We did not show people humility in order to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, those who saw that this was the Lord's way came this way, and those who did not see that this was the Lord's way did not come.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We did not use favors or humility to lead, draw, and gather people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of this some people said that we were proud.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, we would rather be proud than have people take this way because of our outward humility.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We would rather be indifferent toward people than have people take this way merely because we love them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Out of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Any light we received through natural methods and not by reading the Scriptures is of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It does not matter whether we received it early in life or later.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is of religion, and the Bible refers to it as wood, grass, and stubble 1 Cor 3:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not think that wood, grass, and stubble denote sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, they denote our work for the Lord, which may appear to be a service to Him but may not actually be out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First Corinthians 3 tells us, "For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" v. 11 . The foundation is Christ, and what is being built upon it is also Christ gold, silver, and precious stones v. 12a . Everything that is out of Christ is gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything that is out of man is wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
