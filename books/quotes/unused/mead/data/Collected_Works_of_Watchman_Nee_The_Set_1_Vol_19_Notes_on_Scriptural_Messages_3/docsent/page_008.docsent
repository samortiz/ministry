   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Was the work of Pentecost enough?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God had to send Peter to the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At Pentecost Peter exercised the keys and ushered many Jews into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God also wanted him to open the door for Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This fulfilled the Lord's word in Matthew 8:11, which says that there would be many people from the east and from the west, who would recline at table in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before Peter exercised the keys to open the door for Gentiles to be saved, God prepared Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dispensationally speaking, Peter's work ended at the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After this, although Peter still bore many testimonies, his work was dispensationally over.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider how wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Acts 10, Peter went to the house of Cornelius, but Paul repented in Acts 9.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Originally, Paul was a zealous persecutor of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But on his way to Damascus, the Lord shined a light around him and he received grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, his eyes were not yet opened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord sent Ananias, telling him that Paul was the vessel He had chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word expressed the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom of God was large, and Peter had brought in many people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, there was still the need for a manager and designer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the Lord raised up Paul and made him a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ananias put it very well when he said, "Saul, brother."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This meant that every hatred was removed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consequently, Paul was able to testify for the Lord and be useful for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, his work extended from inside the city to outside the city; the scope of his work expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How did he get down from the wall?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was let down by the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although he could have climbed down by himself, he did not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was willing to have the disciples let him down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was brotherly fellowship, help, and approval.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul did not go out alone; he was backed up by others' participation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So many works can be more effectual if they are backed up by others' prayer and help.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Paul originally went to Jerusalem, the disciples were somewhat fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later Paul was able to go in and out among them; there was full fellowship between them with no obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, he was able to continue Peter's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now let us come back to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord called him to the house of Cornelius, he did not want to go at first.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the Lord gave him the vision of a great sheet descending from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Inside there were animals, reptiles, and birds, but no fish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why were there no fish?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We see animals, reptiles, birds, and fish all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why were only three things mentioned, the animals, the reptiles, and the birds, and the fish were omitted?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the type in the story of Noah's ark, fish were never saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The creatures saved through the ark did not include fish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why fish were not included in the things God gave to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the meaning of the great sheet with animals, reptiles, and birds?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us consider this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The great sheet represents Peter's whole work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The extent of Peter's work was not like a vessel which can only contain a certain amount.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was not like a ship which has its limits.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was like a piece of cloth, a great sheet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is cloth?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Cloth does not have a fixed shape.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It has not yet been formed into any shape; it is only a piece of fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who came to make this fabric into something with a shape?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul came.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He specialized in the work of tidying up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may liken Peter to a person who buys cloth and Paul to a tailor or dressmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Throughout his life, Peter's work was like a piece of cloth; it was not limited and it did not have any form or boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let us consider the three things in the great sheet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Birds are the most active animals.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes they fly around, sometimes they rest upon branches or rooftops, and sometimes they take a few steps on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are the most free and not restricted at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are the wildest of all animals.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What about animals?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are ferocious and vicious.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What about reptiles?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They refer to filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In God's eyes, Gentiles are merely animals, reptiles, and birds.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But now God has wrapped up the wild, vicious, and filthy ones in a great sheet.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He has put us in a new environment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He no longer considers us as animals, reptiles, and birds.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the Bible there is only the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens; there is no such thing as the gospel of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We do not hear the gospel and then enter into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, we hear the gospel and enter into God's kingdom, which is a new sphere and a new realm.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once you were under Satan's hand; now you are under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What does it mean to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It means that God puts you in a new position.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today many people make the matter of the church too encompassing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They think that they have everything once they enter into the church, but they forget the matter of entering into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Being saved does not mean entering into only the church; it also means entering into the kingdom of God to become His children, not by power, but by authority John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everyone can enter because it is not according to what a person does, but according to the authority that God has given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All of Peter's work was to bring something from the outside to the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In other words, Peter's work was to bring people into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The meaning of entering into the kingdom of God is to be subject under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Peter's specialty was to draw people and bring in group after group.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When he drew one person in, another citizen was added to God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, he could do nothing to help those who were in the kingdom and needed direction.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul picked up this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Paul's work was to help settle down those whom Peter drew in. Can you find the words "born again" in Paul's Epistles? No, he spoke about justification; he never spoke about being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What about Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He talked about regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He also mentioned "inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Paul only mentioned "inheritance" a little.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>John did not mention anything about it because his focus was on God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The simplest explanation of God's kingdom is that it is the sphere of God's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Acts mentions many things concerning God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Even Paul mentioned God's kingdom because at that time many people were saved and had entered into God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It would be much better if we were clear about this on the day we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The reason we are in such a degraded condition now is that we have made ourselves the center.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Lord only considers us as a helper.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God truly wants to give us blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But more importantly, He wants us to enter His kingdom and be under His ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>O brothers and sisters, salvation is not for our enjoyment; it is for God to deal with us according to His sovereign authority.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Originally you lived a carefree and foolish life; now God wants you to be subject to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>After a person is saved, he cannot live a loose life any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Instead, he must be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Salvation is taking up the Holy Spirit as your yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When you want to be saved, He puts this yoke upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Once you have the yoke, you are a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>From a human point of view, when God saves a person, everything that he receives is not all good because God wants to bring him under His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This was Peter's work.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>No matter what you are animal, reptile, or bird he took everyone into the kingdom of God.</S>
