   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the time of Numbers 14:24 most of the Israelites were quite rebellious toward God, but Caleb was different.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He didn't have another mind, another will, another heart, or another decision.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Caleb had another spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then it says that Caleb followed the Lord fully.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have no other way to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are going to follow the Lord we have to use the proper organ, our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Caleb followed the Lord by another spirit, which is different from all the other spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>HARDENED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Deuteronomy 2:30 says that God hardened the spirit of Sihon the king.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It doesn't say God hardened his heart, but his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's dealing with man is always through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even He allows a person to be hardened in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A STIRRED-UP SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Ezra 1:1, 5, at the time of God's recovery of His people back to Jerusalem, God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, and stirred up the people in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This again shows that God's dealing with us is through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It doesn't say that God stirred up the heart of the king of Persia, because the recovery is altogether God's dealing, and this dealing was absolutely in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, God stirred up the king's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, God stirred up the captives' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then something could be worked out for God's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Haggai 1:14 refers to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, the high priest, and the spirit of all the people for the completion of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ezra 1 tells us about the beginning of the recovery, but Haggai tells us about the continuation of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The beginning and the continuation of the recovery were altogether matters in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then how about today's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely it could never be something outside of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It must be something absolutely in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God is going to recover His church in so many localities, surely you and I must have our spirit stirred up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jeremiah 51:11 says also that the Lord "stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>. This is the vengeance of the Lord, even the vengeance of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Babylon destroyed God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now God stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes to destroy Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That was a kind of vengeance God rendered upon Babylon, the vengeance of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Though we are not the kings of the Medes, God still has to stir up our spirit for the destruction of Babylon and for the vengeance of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of this is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD'S DEALING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Job 6:4 tells us that to Job's realization what he suffered was not just something outward, but something inward in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to our spiritual experiences, Job 6:4 is rather deep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Job says, "For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It shows that although all the sufferings which happened to Job were outward, he realized that God was dealing with him, not just outwardly, but inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's dealing with him was not just something outward in his surroundings, but something inward, deep in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A PRESERVED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Job 10:12 says, "Thou hast granted me life and favour."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That means God has granted me to live and to enjoy so many good things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition, "Thy visitation hath preserved my spirit" v. 12 . Have you ever realized God's visitation? In Job 15:13 it says that "thou turnest thy spirit against God." All these verses show us that the relationship, the fellowship, between us and God, is absolutely a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A COMMITTED AND GUILELESS SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Psalms 31:5 says, "Into thine hand I commit my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Remember that this is a word spoken in the Old Testament by an Old Testament saint.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Have you, as a New Testament saint, ever said something like this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I commit my spirit into Thine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mostly we say we commit our heart into God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Psalms 32:2 says, "Blessed is the man in whose spirit there is no guile."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again, all this portrays clearly that the fellowship and the relationship between us and God is absolutely in our spirit.</S>
