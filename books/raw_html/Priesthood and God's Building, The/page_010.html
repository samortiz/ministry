        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYER AND FELLOWSHIP</h1>
<p>Some Christians pay attention to the priestly ministry of the Lord Jesus, which is related to fellowship, but neglect His kingly ministry, which is related to authority. Other Christians pay attention to the aspect of His kingly authority but neglect the aspect of His priestly ministry. If we stress one aspect more than the other, problems will arise, and the church will not be built up. Therefore, we need to continue to release the light of the truth related to these two matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BUILDING UP THE CHURCH<br />
THROUGH THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The prophecy in Zechariah 6:12-13 speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Builder of the temple. This speaking is very particular, and it shows that the offices of the kingship and the priesthood converged in Joshua, who is a type of the Lord Jesus. The convergence of these two offices is related to building, because the Holy Spirit speaks of Joshua as the one who will &ldquo;build the temple of Jehovah&rsquo;&rsquo; (v. 12). The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s speaking is a strong indication that these two offices are related to the Lord as the Builder of the church, the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AS THE KING, THE LORD<br />
BRINGING GOD&rsquo;S AUTHORITY TO HIS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>From the revelation of the Bible, it is not difficult for us to comprehend that the kingship brings God&rsquo;s authority to His people. At the time of the judges, &ldquo;there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&rdquo; (Judg. 21:25). The lack of a king meant that God&rsquo;s authority was not present. Without God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s people cannot remain on the right track in their respective order. The situation during the time of the judges was full of chaos, because everyone did what was right in his own eyes. In this condition God&rsquo;s people could hardly touch anything related to God&rsquo;s building. During the time of the judges, the Bible does not speak of the building of the temple, and even though the tabernacle existed, it is scarcely mentioned. There is little record of the tabernacle in the book of Judges in comparison to the record in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is related to the lack of kingly authority among God&rsquo;s people; that is, there was no king to represent God&rsquo;s authority among His people.</p>
<p>When David was raised up by God to be king, he brought in God&rsquo;s authority, and the people of God began to come back to the proper path and to leave their chaotic situation. Although king David was good, he was not able to subdue all the enemies of Israel. Hence, even though he brought up the matter of building the temple and was blessed by God, he was not allowed to build the temple (2 Sam. 7:1-17). The building of the temple began when David&rsquo;s son, Solomon, was king. <em>Solomon</em> means &ldquo;peace.&rdquo; Peace in Solomon&rsquo;s time was achieved because of his kingship, which brought God&rsquo;s authority to His people. As soon as Solomon was inaugurated as king, he dealt with the remnants of rebellion in the land, including Shimei (1 Kings 2:36-46). The goal of Solomon&rsquo;s reign was to build the temple; hence, there was a need to deal with the remaining elements of rebellion. When he offered sacrifices to God and fellowshipped with Him, he asked for wisdom and received it (3:5-12). Following this, he established a good order among his officials and servants (4:1-19).</p>
<p>The first two chapters of 1 Kings speak of how Solomon cleared up the remnants of rebellion. Chapter 3 speaks of how he drew near to God and asked for wisdom. Chapter 4 contains a special record of how the Israelites were arranged under an orderly administration. Then chapter 5 speaks of the preparation of the building materials for the temple, and construction officially began in chapter 6. The building could begin because there was a king who brought God&rsquo;s authority to His people so that His people could be brought back to a proper path and arranged in the proper order by God.</p>
<p>In order to build God&rsquo;s temple, the Lord Jesus is revealed as the King who brings God&rsquo;s authority to His people. The church is not only God&rsquo;s house but also God&rsquo;s kingdom. In this kingdom the Lord Jesus is the King, executing God&rsquo;s authority over His people. If the Lord Jesus cannot manifest His kingship among us and exercise God&rsquo;s authority over us to bring us to the right path and place us in the proper order, His church cannot be built up among us.</p>
<p>In Acts, the Epistles, and the seven epistles in Revelation, we see the Lord&rsquo;s authority through kingship in the church. Although the records in Acts and the Epistles do not reflect worldly concepts of organization when they speak of authority, we must admit that the ruling of the Spirit is present in these books. For example, the Lord&rsquo;s authority in the early church is evident in the orderly arrangements that were without confusion. This speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Spirit exercising His kingship among God&rsquo;s people. According to Zechariah 6, the exercise of the kingship is for the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
