   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JEHOVAH GOD S COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We proceed now to Jehovah God s covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 12 God made a promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 15 that promise became a covenant, and in Genesis 17 circumcision was enacted as a token of that covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, what God gave Abraham eventually was not only a promise, but also a covenant with a token.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s promise is His word Rom 9:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever God says that He will do a particular thing for us, that word is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when an oath is added to the promise, the promise becomes a covenant which assures God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a covenant is like a contract.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 6:8 the Lord said to Moses, I will bring you into the land, concerning the which I did lift up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The promise the Lord gave to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was a covenant made by the lifting up of His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To lift up the hand in such a way was to make an oath, to swear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Genesis 14 Abraham told the king of Sodom that he had lifted up his hand unto the most high God not to take anything from him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that Abraham had made an oath concerning that particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament the hand was lifted up when a covenant was made.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the New Testament the whole Person of the Lord Jesus was lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 8:28 the Lord Jesus said, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the lifting up of the Lord Jesus, God made a great oath that caused His promises to become the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the four Gospels the Lord made many promises.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was lifted up on the cross, these promises became the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now the whole New Testament is a covenant, a contract signed and endorsed by the uplifted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was uplifted not only to the cross but, ultimately, to the throne of God in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord is now sitting on the throne as the symbol of the greatest oath in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This oath was made by two steps: by the Lord being uplifted first to the cross and then to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hallelujah, this One whose whole being has been uplifted is now on the throne!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, what we have in our hand today is not a promise, but a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In speaking to Moses about the covenant, God seems to have said, Moses, don t you realize that I have made a covenant with your forefathers?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have lifted up My hand to bring My people into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you think that Pharaoh can stop Me from bringing My people into the promised land?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses, don t be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am, but Pharaoh is not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am Jehovah to fulfill My covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I shall bring My people into the good land and give it to them for a heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses, be encouraged with My covenant and with My present-day name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we also have the Lord s name and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we are doing in the Lord s recovery is not according to our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is according to God s covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the past we have told the Lord that what we are practicing is according to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From now on we need to tell Him that what we are doing is according to His covenant, the very covenant which He has sworn to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In fighting the battle for the Lord s interests, not only do we stand with God s pure Word, but we also stand with His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This covenant was endorsed when the Lord Jesus was uplifted to the cross and to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some say that it is impossible to practice the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They also claim that it is impossible for the Lord to have His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not seem to realize that the Lord s recovery is promised in His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I wish to emphasize the fact that the recovery is not according to our thought, foresight, or imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not even according to our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s recovery is wholly according to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this covenant the Lord Jesus has said, I will build My church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Throughout the years, the enemy has tried to destroy the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But because the recovery is according to God s covenant, it cannot be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We admit that the way of the Lord s recovery is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was the same with the children of Israel in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before they were released from bondage, there were many conflicts between God and Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Pharaoh was not easily dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same principle, today s Pharaoh Satan and the Satan-possessed and usurped self is not easily dealt with either.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes we may be discouraged, just as Moses and the children of Israel were.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At such times we need to remember Jehovah and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How strange it was that God did not annihilate Pharaoh with one blow!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, He purposely engaged in conflict with him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He even deliberately caused Pharaoh s heart to be hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I had been Moses, I would have said, Lord, since You are hardening Pharaoh s heart, why do You send me to him?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By dealing with Pharaoh in this way, the Lord was training Moses and the children of Israel to know Him by the name Jehovah and to know His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No matter how intense the conflict was to become, eventually Jehovah would fulfill His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not be troubled by any opposition to the Lord s recovery, and do not be discouraged when religion rises up against us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today s Pharaoh may struggle, resist, and cause delay, but ultimately he cannot prevail against the Lord and His recovery, for we have the Lord s name and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not engaged in an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The goal of the Lord s recovery is to build up the church according to God s name and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Remember, the Lord has been uplifted to the cross and to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is now on the throne as the sure sign that His covenant has been endorsed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As Jehovah the Savior, the great I Am, He will fulfill His covenant and bring us into the good land.</S>
