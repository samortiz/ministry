<p>The way to have the small group gatherings involves six items.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Remaining Steadfastly<br />
in the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<p>First, a small group needs to keep the teaching of the apostles. Today a majority of Christians do not know the content of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and even fewer know of the apostles&rsquo; fellowship. Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; Although the wording of this verse is plain and easy to understand, it is difficult to translate. We need light from God in order to see the emphasis in these words. Verse 42 speaks of four things: the teaching, the fellowship, the breaking of bread, and the prayers. When Luke wrote this verse, he was precise in his grammatical pairing of these words. In this verse the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles are joined as one group by the conjunction <em>and,</em> and the breaking of bread and the prayers are joined as another group also by the conjunction <em>and.</em></p>
<p>According to common rules of grammar, when objects are listed in sequence, a conjunction can be added after each object. For example, the four items can be listed as &ldquo;the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; Alternatively, a conjunction can be used in front of the last object. For example, the four items can be listed as &ldquo;the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the fellowship, the breaking of bread, and the prayers.&rdquo; However, Luke wrote in a different way in Acts, separating the four items into two groups using the conjunction <em>and</em> twice. This is because the teaching and the fellowship are related to the apostles, but the breaking of bread and the prayers are related to all the saints, not only the apostles.</p>
<p>In the history of Christianity the first group who saw this light was the Brethren in the nineteenth century. Before the Brethren, no one, not even the church fathers, could explain the significance of the wording in Acts 2:42. The Brethren saw that the teaching and the fellowship are of the apostles; that is, there is only one teaching, the unique teaching, and there is only one fellowship, the unique fellowship, both of which are brought in by the apostles. In 1934 Brother Nee spoke concerning these four matters. He said that the teaching and the fellowship are of the apostles, whereas the breaking of bread and the prayers are not. This was new light to me.</p>
<p>Today all the divisions in Christianity are due to different teachings. The Presbyterian denomination has Presbyterian teachings, the Baptist denomination has Baptist teachings, the Catholic Church has Catholic teachings, and other denominations have their respective teachings. Once a different teaching comes in, Christians are divided. Therefore, in 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain dissenting ones not to teach different things. Teaching different things means to teach things that are different from what the apostles taught.</p>
<p>The Old Testament speaks of the law and the prophets. When the Lord Jesus came, He spoke concerning Christ and eventually concerning the church. He appointed twelve apostles, who then preached what the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit revealed to them&mdash;Christ and the church. Christ and the church are God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The word <em>economy</em> is relatively difficult to understand. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s intention, plan, and arrangement. In Christ God was manifested in the flesh, passed through human living, crucifixion, death, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Now He can dispense Himself into those who believe in Him so that they may become the members of Christ. Corporately speaking, they become the church, the Body of Christ. Christ is the mystery of God, whereas the church is the mystery of Christ. Together these two mysteries are a great mystery. This great mystery&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament speak of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; the teaching of the apostles also speaks of God&rsquo;s economy. In the apostles&rsquo; time, however, some Jewish Christians would not drop the law in the Old Testament; they were concerned with genealogies and their forefathers. Their speaking led many New Testament saints away from Christ and the church to Moses, David, and the law. In their speaking, they were teaching different things.</p>
<p>Some of us were in Christianity for many years and never heard the pure word concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Instead, Christian preachers focused on doctrines related to foot-washing and baptism. Disputes concerning the method and place of baptism have been the source of many divisions among Christians. To insist on a particular form of baptism is to speak different things. Today even the Pentecostal movement teaches different things by focusing on the matter of speaking in tongues. It is rare, however, to hear them speak concerning Christ, much less the church. This is to teach different things.</p>
<p>The speaking of the apostles was centered on Christ and the church&mdash;Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries constitute the great mystery, which is referred to in 1 Timothy 3:16: &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: / He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; <em>Flesh</em> in this verse refers not only to Christ but also to the church. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, particularly when gathering as a small group, we must speak concerning the economy of God&mdash;Christ and the church.</p>
<p>In the apostolic age, teachings related to Greek philosophy, the so-called teaching of the Gnostics, entered into the church in addition to Judaistic things. Paul wrote Colossians to tell the saints that Christ is everything and that they did not need Greek philosophy, just as they did not need the Jewish law. Today Christianity is full of confusion, and there are many methods of biblical interpretation, some of which are not trustworthy. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need to return to the Bible and speak only the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The small group gatherings must hold on to this matter. We should not think that we can speak whatever we like in a small group.</p>
<p>We have to pay attention to this point, because once a small group is formed, there will be a wide-open door. Four hundred small groups will equal four hundred doors. If we are not clear concerning the truth, these open doors will result in disaster. In just a few years many different teachings could be brought into the church. Therefore, the first crucial matter in the way to have a small group is to keep the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>If we speak concerning such things as head covering, baptism, or speaking in tongues, there will be endless disputes. Those who are in a small group must not open a door for disputes. We desire only the teaching of the apostles, which is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. In the churches of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should not emphasize unimportant matters; we should stress only God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is the teaching of the apostles.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4: The Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
