BY EATING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD AND<br />
SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p><em>Question: Sometimes I do not have an appetite for the Lord&rsquo;s Word. I am not hungry or thirsty. How can I restore my appetite? Is there a secret?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The secret to restoring our spiritual appetite is to eat something even when we have no desire. The less we eat, the less appetite we have. People know that food is the best medicine; therefore, we should never stop eating. Regardless of whether we have an appetite, we need to eat a little. Eating consistently will restore our appetite. We need to eat spiritual food, but we also need to practice speaking for the Lord in the meetings. Even if we have nothing to say, we still need to say something. Eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word and speaking for the Lord will restore our spiritual appetite.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SAVING AND SUPPLYING US<br />
BEING A LAW</h2>
<p><em>Question: In past messages you said that the mysterious dispensing of the Lord operates constantly, twenty-four hours a day, and that His dispensing brings in an all-inclusive dose for healing. Does the Lord dispense Himself into us regardless of our condition? Will He still dispense Himself into us if we are occupied with the world?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We can use a tree with branches to illustrate dispensing. The branches of a tree are constantly supplied by the tree; they are supplied twenty-four hours a day. Such a supply is a law. As a further example, we are surrounded by air twenty-four hours a day. We breathe air, and we enjoy the supply of air. This is also a law. If we are to gain the Lord&rsquo;s supply, we must meet the conditions of His law. Most Christians do not know that the Lord&rsquo;s supply is a law. Even our being saved is according to a law. The natural understanding is that the Lord does not intend to save man but that He is moved to save man because man cries out, wails, fasts, abstains from sleep, and prays desperately to be saved. This is not the law of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The Lord died for man&rsquo;s sin, was raised from the dead, ascended to heaven as the Savior (Acts 5:30-31), and became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The Lord&rsquo;s way of salvation is a law. Any person who repents and confesses the Lord Jesus as his Savior will be saved. The Lord saves people according to His law.</p>
<p>Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; This indicates that the law of the Spirit of life frees us and saves us because we have met the conditions of this law, not because the Lord has heard our earnest prayer. As soon as we are in Christ Jesus, we are freed. For example, a person who is surrounded by air does not need to pray to receive air. As long as nothing obstructs his air passages, he will receive a constant supply of air if he obeys the law of breathing. However, he will not receive a constant supply if his breathing organs are defective, because air cannot get into him. Likewise, the Lord has no way to constantly supply a person who loves the world. The problem is not with the Lord but with the person. The Lord&rsquo;s supply and care for us are according to a law. He says, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready&rdquo; (Luke 14:17). All things are ready and have become a law. The problem is whether we are willing to eat. If we are willing to come to the Lord and eat, we will meet the conditions of His law. As a result, we will immediately enjoy His supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING TO MAINTAIN<br />
OUR SPIRITUAL EXISTENCE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Pray-reading the Word can help us to have subjective experiences of the Lord, but I do not have much feeling when I pray-read. If enjoying the Lord is a law, should we believe that we are enjoying the Lord as long as we meet the conditions of the law, whether or not we have any feeling?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is absolutely correct. We may not have an appetite or desire to eat by pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we may not feel any enjoyment while pray-reading, and we may even forget the Lord&rsquo;s Word immediately after pray-reading, but this does not diminish the effect of pray-reading. If someone asks me what I ate this morning, I may recall that I ate vegetables, an egg, oatmeal, and some bananas, but I may not recall what I ate yesterday morning. This does not mean that the breakfast I remember is effective and that the breakfast I do not remember is ineffective. We cannot say that only tasty food is effective, nor can we say that food that is not tasty is ineffective. Actually, food that is very tasty may not be good for our health. Americans like to eat sweets, but they are harmful to our health. Therefore, in order to maintain our spiritual existence, we should not pay attention to taste or feeling, nor should we try to remember what we pray-read. Our need is to eat. I do not remember what I ate twenty years ago, but I am clear that I will die if I do not eat. Hence, we need to build up the habit of eating. Similarly, calling on the name of the Lord should become a habit. We should not call in a casual way; rather, we should call in a serious way. Even if we do not have an appetite, we should still call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; We should call when we feel a sense of sweetness and call when we do not feel a sense of sweetness. The benefits that we gain are the same.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
