   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Nourishing Element, the Word of Life,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Resurrection of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 2:16 says, Holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word of life is the nourishing element in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every morning when we pray-read a portion of the Word, we receive a killing element and a nourishing element at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nourishing element in the Word sustains, satisfies, waters, and supports us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It brings many positive riches into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word of life is the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word in the Bible is composed of Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of the page of the Bible that we read, we will receive these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not study the Bible as we would study a book of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible is not a book of ethics; it is the word of God, composed of Christ as life, His death as the killing element, and His resurrection as the nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three main items are in every portion of the Scriptures, regardless of what the subject matter is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many stories in the four Gospels, but either Christ, His death, or His resurrection is in every story.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever portion of the Bible we read, something always kills us, and something always supplies us with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we read or study the Bible, if we do not receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection, our reading or our studying is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regardless of the kind of food we eat, we always need to receive a killing element and a nourishing element from our food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, regardless of the book, page, chapter, or verse we read in the Bible, we need to receive some killing element and some resurrecting power to meet our spiritual need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Science has discovered that the content of healthy food exactly matches our physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The various vitamins and minerals that our bodies need are all found in our food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some are in meats, and others are in grains, fruits, and vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under God s sovereignty all our necessities are included in our food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we eat food, we receive all the elements that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way, whatever we need in our spiritual life is all included in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These items constitute the word of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because we all are fallen, old, and corrupted human beings, every day we need some killing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are all part of Adam and are therefore six thousand years old.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are old and full of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As fallen, old, and corrupted people, we daily need a killing element, and this element, this antibiotic, is found in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We receive certain antibiotic elements by taking in three healthy meals every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, we receive spiritual antibiotics by taking in the word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to come to the Word two or three times each day to receive the killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible is a killing book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many saints, both young and old, have experienced the killing element in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under God s sovereignty all the necessities of our physical life are found in natural foods.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same principle, all that we need for our spiritual life is in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need both the killing and the nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every morning I receive nourishment from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if I do not have much time, I always come to the Word for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We always receive nourishment when we come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE CONTENT OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>AND OF THE SPIRIT BEING THE SAME</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that in order to touch Christ, we must touch the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we touch the word, we receive Christ in reality, not only in name, doctrine, or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also receive the killing element of His death and the nourishing element of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we will see that the content of the word and of the Spirit are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit Being Compounded</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Few Christians know that today God s Spirit is no longer simply the Spirit of God Gen 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s Spirit today is a compound Spirit, compounded with the same elements that are the constituents of the word of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Holy Spirit today is compounded with Christ, with His death, and with His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a wonderful type in the Old Testament, a picture, showing that God the Spirit has been compounded with Christ s divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection Exo 30:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the Holy Spirit is a compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit of God in Old Testament times can be compared to a cup of pure water with no other elements, but the Spirit of God today can be likened to a rich drink in which tea, milk, and sugar have been added into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit today is a compound drink, composed of God s divinity compounded with other elements.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This drink is an all-inclusive drink.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we drink this compound drink, we receive all the elements that have been compounded into it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit of God in the New Testament age is no longer only the Spirit of God; He is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
