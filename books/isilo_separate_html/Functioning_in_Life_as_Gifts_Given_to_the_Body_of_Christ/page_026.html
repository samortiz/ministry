<p>This is not a mere exhortation for us to function. We must realize that function is a matter of life. Therefore, we have to feast on the Lord, live by Him, and mingle with Him, as the priests did. This is why the first item we covered in the previous message was to see what a priest is. We must be that kind of person with that kind of life, enjoyment of life, and growth of life. Then we will be the right persons to express Christ. This is our function. Then along with this priesthood we will have the sense that the kingship also is here. The authority of God is exercised along with the image of God. Whenever we have the image of God, we have His authority. Adam was created in the image of God, so the authority of God was committed to him (Gen. 1:26). Authority always goes along with image.</p>
<p>It is by the priesthood with the kingship that the image of God is expressed and the authority of God is exercised. Revelation 20 and 22 tell us that both in the millennial kingdom and in eternity, when we will serve as priests, we will also reign as kings. Moreover, there will be no further need for the ministry of the prophets. I hope that by His mercy, the churches in all the localities may have a life full of the priesthood with the kingship, not requiring the ministry of the prophets; that is, that we would have much life without the need of much gift.</p>
<p>We may receive a gift without life, but we can never have authority in the church without life. If a brother is in the position of an elder but is short of the growth of life, gradually and eventually he will lose the real eldership, that is, the authority. However, the more a brother grows in life and is filled with the riches of Christ, even if he is not in the position of an elder, the brothers and sisters will realize that with him there is the authority. This is illustrated by the budding rod of Aaron in Numbers 17:2 through 8. The rod is a symbol of authority, and the budding of the rod is a matter of resurrection life. The authority among the Lord&rsquo;s children is a matter of life, not merely a matter of position. To elect a brother to be an elder does not work. We can place him in the position of an elder, but if he does not have the growth in life, his dead, lifeless &ldquo;rod&rdquo; will not bud. The kingship is a matter of life. Prophecy, on the other hand, is a matter of gift. We can receive the gift of prophecy quickly, but we cannot exercise the kingship in this way. The kingship depends on the growth of life. We have to feast on Christ, put on Christ, dwell in Christ, and be mingled with Christ. Christ must be wrought, woven, and mingled with us. Then we will have the measure of Christ to serve as priests. This is a matter of life, not of gift.</p>
<p>To one extent or another, we are all priests. Some may be bigger priests while some are smaller priests. Some may not be priests in the Holy of Holies, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy they are priests in the Holy Place. Others still may be priests in the outer court. Perhaps last year we were in the outer court, but this year we are in the Holy Place. Last year we may have known only how to offer the offerings, but this year we know how to offer the incense. Perhaps next year we will be priests in the Holy of Holies. For this we need the growth in life. The way to have the growth of life is by feeding and feasting on Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER PRIESTHOOD REQUIRING US TO KNOW AND DISCERN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 tells us to enter into the Holy of Holies. Only the priests can enter the Holy of Holies. In this way, the book of Hebrews confirms that we are the priests. If we were not priests, we would not be entitled to enter the Holy of Holies. Today the Holy of Holies is in our human spirit. Therefore, we need to learn how to know and discern the spirit (4:12; Rom. 8:6). Then we will know how to exercise our priesthood. If we do not know the spirit and cannot discern the spirit, it is hard to practice the priesthood. To know our human spirit is not mere doctrine. If we did not know where our mouth was, we could not eat. In the same way, we must be brought back to know our spirit, where we can contact the Lord.</p>
<p>I have the full assurance that the Lord will recover the enjoyment in our spirit for the proper priesthood and kingship. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which is a matter of His government. It is not a small matter to touch the government of the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us that we would learn to know Him in a living way as the tree of life, to know the spirit, and to exercise the priesthood to enjoy Him. May the Lord be merciful that we would go to Him and stay with Him for some time about all these matters. We should pray over and pray regarding all these things. Then we will see that this is not merely a teaching. Rather, all these matters are for us to share in and enjoy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
