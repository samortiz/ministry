Lord, be with us, even making us one spirit with You. Lord, we hate to do anything by ourselves, without You. Lord, make our speaking Yours, making our speaking Your speaking. Vindicate Your recovery by the high truths, by Your speaking, by Your Spirit being one with us as one spirit. Lord, have mercy and give us grace that we can finish this message. Thank You for the past. Amen.<p>In the previous message, we saw the subjective application of the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection to us in our daily experience. This is not an easy thing to grasp. In Philippians 3:10 we are charged by the apostle Paul to be conformed to the death of Christ. Paul also told us in Romans 8:13 that by the Spirit we put all the practices of our flesh to death that we may live. He spoke further in Galatians 5:24-25 concerning the application of the death of Christ. In verse 24 he said that those who are of Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. Then verse 25 says, &#8220;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&#8221; To walk by the Spirit is to be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of the Spirit. To apply the death and resurrection of Christ to our daily walk subjectively to make us divine, to make us golden, is by the Spirit. Christ, the One who accomplished crucifixion and who has consummated the resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. He Himself is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17).<p>In the previous message concerning the pearl gates of the holy city, we used the word secretion with the picture of an oyster secreting its life-juice around a grain of sand to make it a pearl. Christ today is secreting His life-juice around us, and this secreting is carried out by Him as the Spirit. When we apply His death in our daily walk, no doubt, that is by the Spirit&#8217;s dispensing. The Spirit dispenses the life-juice of Christ as a kind of secretion, which issues in precious pearl. Also, to apply Christ&#8217;s resurrection in our daily experience, in our daily walk, is by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. By this bountiful supply, Paul could live and magnify the resurrected One, Christ (Phil. 1:19-21).<p>By all these verses, we can see that to apply both the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ, we have to touch the Spirit and be touched by the Spirit. It is only by the Spirit that we can apply Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection subjectively to our daily life in our daily experience. Now we want to go on to see the wall of the city and its foundations.<h2 class=head1>I. ITS WALL AND ITS FOUNDATIONS BEING PRECIOUS STONES</h2><p>Revelation 21 shows that the wall of the city and its foundations are precious stones (vv. 18a, 19-20).<h2 class=head2>A. Created by God with Dust</h2><p>We, the believers in Christ, were created by God with dust (Gen. 2:7).<h2 class=head2>B. Becoming Stones through Regeneration</h2><p>Through our regeneration by the Spirit we became stones (John 1:42). When Peter came to the Lord, the Lord told him he was a stone. He was no longer dust.<h2 class=head2>C. Transformed into Precious Stones</h2><p>By our growth in the divine life in Christ as the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), we are transformed into precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12a).<h2 class=head3>1. By the Transformation of the Spirit</h2><p>This transformation takes place by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). With Christ there is His death and resurrection. With the Spirit there is transformation. God is triune and His intention is to work Himself into us as the gold to be the base. In other words, He works Himself into us to make us divine, golden. But how can God work Himself into us? He does this by Christ&#8217;s redemption and resurrection and also by the Spirit&#8217;s transformation. The Father&#8217;s golden nature is the base. The Son&#8217;s redemption and resurrection are the steps to work the Triune God into us. Christ died on the cross with the intention of working the Father into His believers as the golden base. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to carry out the work of transformation.<p>We may have the base, redemption, and resurrection, but if we do not have transformation we are still not golden. We are dusty, because we were made by God in the old creation. But God works Himself into us as the gold through Christ&#8217;s redemption and resurrection by the transformation of the Spirit. This is the working of the Triune God to bring Himself into our being and transform us altogether into His image. His image, ultimately, is the gold.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
