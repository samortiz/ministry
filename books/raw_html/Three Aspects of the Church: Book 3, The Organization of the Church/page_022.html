	 <h2 class="head4">Having Functions</h2>
<p>In the appointing of elders, the two crucial matters to consider are the matters of authority and life. Once these two matters are clear, there can be an additional consideration, that is, how much function a brother has. If two persons are similar in their submission to authority and in their condition of life, yet one has a greater function than the other, then the one with the greater function should be appointed. In the appointment of elders one should pay attention to function, but function is not a crucial matter. What is truly important are the matters of authority and life. Because the elders submit to authority, they are qualified to represent authority in the church. The elders are the authority in a local church. The reason they can be the authority is that they themselves submit to authority. A person who does not submit to authority is not qualified to be an authority. If I am under some people, and some are under me, my being under them is a matter of my submitting to authority, and some being under me is a matter of my being the authority.</p>
<p>The degree to which an elder submits to God&rsquo;s authority will be the degree to which people submit to him as an authority. When the children of Israel rose up against Moses, he did not say, &ldquo;I have authority, and I will strike you down.&rdquo; On the contrary, when the children of Israel troubled him, he prostrated himself before God. As a result, God spoke on his behalf and defended him. Today God&rsquo;s speaking and defending take place in others&rsquo; spirits. It is not an outward matter. The Spirit of God in the spirit of others causes them to submit. The saints&rsquo; submission to an elder is based on the elder&rsquo;s submission to God. Strictly speaking, the authority is not the elder, nor is it something of his own. The authority is God, and it belongs to God. The key is whether or not an elder submits to the authority of God.</p>
<p>Some may be concerned about others assuming authority, but it must be understood that nothing is more real and more difficult to feign than authority. If a person submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit, he does not need to boast and say, &ldquo;I submit to the authority of God.&rdquo; When others contact him, they can sense whether or not he has authority. However, if he does not submit to the authority of God, no matter how much he tries to assume authority and declares himself an authority, his efforts will be useless. When others contact him, they will be able to discern the real situation. Saul is Saul, and David is David. Whenever we contact others, they know whether we are David or Saul. In regard to authority, a person simply cannot pretend. Submission to authority is a serious requirement for the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Appointment of Elders and Its Relationship<br />
to the Condition of the Saints</h2>
<h2 class="head4">There Must Be Spiritual Saints<br />
in Order to Have Spiritual Elders</h2>
<p>In regard to the appointment of elders, the saints also face a serious requirement; that is, they must be spiritual. Any time the saints do not submit to the authority of God and are not proper in their inward condition toward God, they will choose Saul and reject David. However, if they submit to God, and are proper in their inward condition toward God, they will choose David and reject Saul. When an elder who is in the flesh meets with a believer who is in the flesh, they will either talk nicely or argue fiercely. The flesh is able to be friendly or quarrelsome.</p>
<p>The kind of elder a saint prefers shows the kind of person the saint is. Those who are deceived by fleshly elders are surely in the flesh themselves. This can be compared to a person who becomes sick. When the body is weak, germs invade; however, if the body is strong, it is hard for germs to invade. Therefore, never say that an elder has deceived you. If you have been deceived, this shows not only that he is living in the flesh but also that you are living in the flesh.</p>
<p>The kind of kings whom the children of Israel preferred was an indication of their condition. The fact that they wanted Saul to be king shows that they were like Saul. When saints in a church are fleshly, we should not expect the elders among them to be spiritual. Even if the elders were spiritual, they would feel a need to be somewhat hidden. At such a time someone like Saul, who has a big stature, would surely rise up to lead them as king. He would do so because there are many fleshly ones to support him, and it would be the best opportunity for him to be enthroned.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the saints learn to live in the spirit and submit to God&rsquo;s authority, there will be absolutely no place for Saul. If a Saul rises up, the spiritual atmosphere will certainly subdue him, and he will not be given any ground. Then a David, a man according to God&rsquo;s heart, will rise up and reign for God. Hence, the condition of the elders in the church speaks forth the condition of the church. In other words, the condition of the church testifies of the condition of the elders in the church. A spiritual church will have spiritual elders. In the same way, the presence of spiritual elders indicates that the church is spiritual.</p>
