<p>After a Christian has received the assurance that he is really saved, he may consider, &ldquo;I know that I am saved today, but how do I know that I will be saved tomorrow? Is it possible for me to lose my salvation?&rdquo; For such a one, it is no longer a question of <em>assurance,</em> but one of <em>security.</em></p>
<p>A man with millions in the bank has the <em>assurance</em> that the riches are his. But if the bank insists on leaving their vault unlocked, our rich friend will have a real problem with the <em>security</em> of his riches. He knows he is rich today, but he does not know about tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is our salvation like that? Is it something which we have today but may lose at any moment? The answer is, unequivocally, no. We can boldly say, &ldquo;I know that whatever God does, it will be forever&rdquo; (Eccl. 3:14).</p>
<p>One wonderful fact regarding our salvation in Christ is that it is irreversible, that is, it cannot be undone. Once we are saved, we are saved forever because our salvation has as its basis the very nature and person of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Salvation Was Initiated by God</h2>
<p>Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&rdquo; (John 15:16). In other words, salvation was God&rsquo;s idea, not ours. In eternity past we were chosen and even predestinated (marked out) by Him (Eph. 1:4-5). Furthermore, it was He who called us (Rom. 8:29-30). Since it was God&rsquo;s plan to save us in the first place, it is also His plan to keep us in that salvation. Could God choose us, mark us out, call us into salvation and then abandon us? No, God&rsquo;s salvation is eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Love and Grace Are Eternal</h2>
<p>Furthermore, God&rsquo;s love and grace toward us are not conditional or temporary. It was not love from our side that saved us, but love from His (1 John 4:10). He loved us with an eternal love (Jer. 31:3). His grace was toward us in eternity past, before the world began (2 Tim. 1:9). When Christ loves us, He loves us to the uttermost (John 13:1). No sin, failure, or weakness on our part can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:35-39).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Is Righteous</h2>
<p>But our salvation is based not only upon God&rsquo;s love and grace, but even more upon God&rsquo;s righteousness. Our God is a righteous God. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14). If God were to be unrighteous, His throne would lose its foundation. Therefore, if our salvation in any way involves God&rsquo;s righteousness, it is very strong indeed.</p>
<p>Suppose you run a red light and are given a $25 ticket. That $25 fine is a righteous penalty, and the law of the land demands that you pay it. If a civil judge simply overlooks your offense and releases you without paying, he is an unrighteous judge. It is not a matter of whether or not the judge loves you; he is bound by the law to collect the fine.</p>
<p>In the same way, our problem before God before we were saved was a legal one. We had broken God&rsquo;s law by our sin and had thus incurred the law&rsquo;s righteous judgment. According to the law of God, where transgression of the law is, death must take place (Rom. 6:23; Ezek. 18:4). It is not a matter of God loving us, overlooking our sins, and forgetting about the law&rsquo;s judgment. If God were to do this, His very throne would topple. God is bound by His own law to judge sin. What can He do?</p>
<p>Since God desired to save us and since we could not pay the debt of sin ourselves, He in His mercy decided to do so Himself. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ, the incarnate God, came to die on the cross to pay the debt for our sin. Having no sin Himself, He alone was qualified to die this substitutionary death. His death, being reckoned by God as ours, was acceptable to God, and He raised Him from the dead. Now when we believe in Christ, His death is counted in God&rsquo;s sight as our own. Thus, our debt of sin is righteously paid, and we are saved.</p>
<p>Now, can God take back this salvation which Christ has purchased? Absolutely not! Since the debt was paid, for God to demand it again from us would be unrighteous. The same righteousness which formerly called for our condemnation now calls for our justification. What powerful security this gives to our salvation! Even a worldly judge would not demand the same fine to be paid twice. Certainly God, the source of all justice and righteousness, cannot do so. As Watchman Nee wrote in a hymn:</p>
<p class="hbody">For me forgiveness He has gained,<br />
And full acquittal was obtained,<br />
 All debts of sin are paid;<br />
God would not have His claim on two,<br />
First on His Son, my Surety true,<br />
 And then upon me laid.</p>
<p>Thus, the Bible declares that when God saves us, He shows forth His righteousness (Rom. 1:16-17; 3:25-26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">We Have Become God&rsquo;s Children</h2>
<p>When we were saved, we not only <em>received</em> something; we also became something. We became children of God, born of His eternal life (John 1:12-13). A human father may be able to take back a gift he has given to his child, but he can never take back the human life which he has imparted. Although the child may misbehave, the child is still the father&rsquo;s. In the same way, we are God&rsquo;s children. Although we may have many weaknesses and may require His discipline, our sins and weaknesses cannot change the fact that we are His children. The life we received by our second birth is the eternal life, the indestructible life, the life of God, the life that can never die. Once we are born again, we can never be &ldquo;un-born.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Is Strong</h2>
<p>Another reason for the security of our salvation is God&rsquo;s strength. God is unwilling to allow anything or anyone to snatch us from Him. Jesus said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father...is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo; (John 10:28-29). The hand of the Father and the hand of the Lord Jesus are two strong hands holding us fast. Even if we try to run away from our Father, it would be impossible. Not only is God stronger than Satan, He is also stronger than we are.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Never Changes</h2>
<p>If it were possible to lose our salvation, many of us would have lost it long ago. As human beings, we go through many changes. One day we are hot; the next, cold. But our salvation is not based upon our erratic feelings. It is rooted and grounded in a God who is unchanging in His love and faithfulness toward us (Mal. 3:6). James 1:17 says, &ldquo;The Father of lights, with whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning.&rdquo; Lamentations 3:22-23 says, &ldquo;His compassions do not fail; they are new every morning. Great is Your faithfulness.&rdquo; If He loved us enough to save us, He surely loves us enough to keep us in that same salvation. Great is His faithfulness!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Has Promised</h2>
<p>Finally, Christ Himself has promised to keep us, uphold us, and never leave us. Although men often are unrighteous in keeping their promises, Christ will never fail to accomplish what He pledges. Listen to His promise: &ldquo;Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out&rdquo; (John 6:37); &ldquo;I shall by no means give you up, neither by any means shall I abandon you&rdquo; (Heb. 13:5). The Lord&rsquo;s promises here are unconditional. &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; that is, under no circumstances whatever, will He ever cast us out or cease to uphold us. This is His faithful promise.</p>
<p>What powerful security our salvation has! We have God&rsquo;s selection, His predestination, His calling, His love, His grace, His righteousness, His life, His strength, His unchanging faithfulness, and His promises as the foundation, guaranty, and security of our salvation. We can all declare with Paul: &ldquo;I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:12).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
