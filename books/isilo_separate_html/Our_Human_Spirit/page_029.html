If you are going to exercise yourself unto godliness, you have to know how to exercise your spirit because the very God is in your spirit. These verses are the scriptural ground for the exercise of the spirit.<h2 class=head1>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p>The Christian walk is a walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4) which is our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We have seen that we can know this spirit by sensing the different aspects of life, peace, or death. Whatever we do, whatever we say, we have to do it and say it by the spirit, not by the soul or by the flesh. Whatever we do, we must turn to the Lord. Some Christians may think to turn to the Lord means to turn to the heavens, but to turn to the Lord in our experience is to turn to our spirit because the Lord is in our spirit. This means to set our mind on the spirit (Rom. 8:6). To set our mind on the spirit means to turn ourselves to the Lord. We must turn away from the flesh, away from reason, away from sickness, and away from troubles. Even Bible knowledge and teaching could be a distraction from which we must turn away. Day by day we have been distracted from our spirit by many outward things.<p>To love your wife is not wrong, but good. To consider the Bible teachings and seek after knowledge is good, but in our love, consideration, and seeking, we are mostly independent from the Lord. We set our mind, which represents our self, on so many things other than the Lord Himself in our spirit. We mostly either do things by the soul or by the flesh, not by the spirit. We all must learn this practice: whatever happens to us, we must turn ourselves to the Lord. This means to turn to the spirit. On the one hand, I deny my natural and independent mind, emotion, and will, which is my self. On the other hand, I learn to sense the spirit. I only do things when I sense that I have the inner life and peace. To do this is to exercise the spirit. We all must practice to walk according to spirit in this way.<p>Romans 7 shows us a person trying to be good, trying to keep the law of God. The law of God is outside of us. The person in Romans 7 was trying, endeavoring, and struggling to keep the law of God. His intent, thought, and desire were directed outward. But in Romans 8, this person&#8217;s direction is changed. He would never be distracted by anything, not even by the law of God. He directs himself to nothing else but the Lord Himself in his spirit. In Romans 8 we have to walk according to spirit (v. 4). We are not supposed to strive, to struggle, to endeavor to do good, or to keep the law by ourselves. We are just charged to walk according to spirit. Whatever I do, whatever I say, I do it and say it by denying my mind, emotion, and will, and by sensing the spirit. If I have the life and peace, I do it or say it. If I don&#8217;t have life and peace I don&#8217;t do it or say it. This is the way for us to exercise the spirit, to use the spirit.<h2 class=head1>A CHANGE OF ORGAN</h2><p>So many of us simply do not exercise our spirit or use our spirit. In our daily life we don&#8217;t care for our spirit or pay attention to it. We care for so many good things and try to do these good things by ourselves. We must have a change, not of the things, but of the organ. The question is: do you use the soul or the spirit?<p>For example, since I am a Christian, I have to love my brother, so I change hatred into love. This is a change of things. Morally speaking, this change is right. Spiritually speaking, it is not so right. When I hated this brother, I hated with my self. When I loved this brother I also loved in my self. Now I have to change by exercising the spirit. This is a change of organ. Formerly, my dealing with my brother was in the self. Now I have to change my dealing with this brother to the spirit. By changing the organ, I learn how to exercise and use my spirit.<p>If I do mean business with the Lord, I must learn how to exercise my spirit. I must firstly reject my mind, my reasoning, my emotion, and my desire. I just stop exercising my soul. Then I begin to exercise my spirit. As we practice this day by day, this exercise will become our habit.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
