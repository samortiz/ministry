   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT GOD NEEDING MAN Scripture Reading: Isa 6:8; 1 Sam 1:10-11; John 7:17 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us that God needs man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God needs man to cooperate with Him before He can fulfill His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the six days of creation, man was the center of God's creating work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God could only rest after He had created man; He could not rest without man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although man later fell, God's intention concerning man has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He still wants to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man's salvation, edification, and maturity in spiritual life is for the satisfaction of God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The greatest necessity in God's work is human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At no time and place has God's work been carried out without human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man works together with God, and God cannot do anything without man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work of God here does not include His work of creation in the six days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The work of creation in the six days was God's own work, and man had no part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From Genesis to Revelation, we can see that God has always been seeking man, gaining man, guiding man, and working through man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to do anything, God first gains some men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If He has not gained some men, He cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can see this from a few examples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider the story of Noah and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of Noah, God clearly wanted to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if He did not gain Noah, He could not fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God had to find Noah, work through him, and accomplish His will by means of him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wanted an ark, but He also had to find a person who had a heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God had to find a person who could cooperate with Him before He could build an ark.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had to find Noah, who sympathized with Him, walked with Him, and received His commission before He could accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God had to gain man before He could do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for the story of the ark to be written, God had to first secure Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In him we see a man walking with God and working with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider the story of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God intended to deliver the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh, but He first had to gain Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without Moses, God had no way to save the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that God is omnipotent and almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if He did not have Moses, it would have been impossible for Him to deliver the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Moses had not allowed God to use him, God could only have waited until someone was raised up and then use this one to deliver the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Moses' deliverance of the children of Israel, we also see God's need for man's cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle here is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the Israelites reached the foot of Mount Sinai, God ordered them to make a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He intended to fill the tabernacle with His glory and dwell among men through the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet He needed a group of men to build the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If God had not found Moses and a group of people to build the tabernacle, He could not have revealed Himself to the Israelites or dwelt among men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the coming of the Lord Jesus, we have a clearer picture of man's cooperation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who is our Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was no one in the universe who could meet God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus was more than a man, yet throughout His life on earth, He always maintained His stand as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although He is God and the Son of God, He always did things as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He was tempted, Satan told Him more than once that He ought to do things as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan tried to lure Him away from the position of a man to the position of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the Lord Jesus answered, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He meant that He was on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was tempted by Satan because He became flesh and was made a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He cast out a demon, the demon cried, "I know who You are the Holy One of God."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the Lord silenced him Mark 1:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The main purpose of the Lord coming to the earth was to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" Luke 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Nathanael came to the Lord, he said, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord answered and said, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man" John 1:49-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He always said the Son of Man did such and such.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always stood in the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God can only accomplish His work through man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When man could not satisfy God's demand, He sent His beloved Son to earth to become a man, to satisfy His own demand, and to accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later, we see the Lord Jesus sending the twelve and then sending the seventy Luke 9:1-2; 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to accomplish His work, God needs a group of men.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All of God's work among men from Genesis to Revelation requires the cooperation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without man, God can do nothing, and His work cannot be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Isaiah 6:8 God said, "Whom shall I send?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Who will go for Us?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God has the desire to spread the gospel and save some men, but there is no one whom He can use.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some people are occupied by vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Others are occupied by enjoyment, families, or ease.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These ones only care for their own affairs, and they have no heart for the propagation of the gospel or for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers and sisters, do you realize that many people are not saved because of your refusal to cooperate with Him, rather than any unwillingness on God's part?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God has the desire to save, but you have no desire to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If every brother and sister was willing to cooperate with God, the number of saved ones would be beyond your ability to calculate.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's work cannot go on because He has not found men.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, God must gain you before He can accomplish His work.</S>
