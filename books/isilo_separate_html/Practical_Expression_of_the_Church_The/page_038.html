And why must you look down on those who do not speak in tongues? If you think speaking in tongues can help you, do it. But do not look down on those who do not do it. And if you do not speak in tongues, do not look down on those who do. We really need grace to be one in this way. The fellowship of the Body and of the church is based upon one thing: that is, we all are redeemed by the same blood and regenerated by the same divine life.<p>Our practice is one thing, but to take our practice as a basis for fellowship is another. Our practice may be according to our need, but we should not make our practice the basis of fellowship. For instance, we love to practice pray-reading because it helps us to enjoy the Lord, but we should never make pray-reading the basis of fellowship. Whether you like pray-reading or not, we do not care. We simply love you because you are a brother.<p>Some who speak in tongues always like to convince others to speak in tongues. This is the problem. And some who practice baptism by immersion always like to convince others to take immersion. But we must be willing to drop all of these things as a basis for fellowship. We may practice certain things because they help us, but we should not make any practice a basis for our fellowship. We really need grace for this.<p>Even our way of doing things should not hinder our fellowship. The way we do things may differ from that of others. If this is the case, we should not say a word. Our way of doing things is not the basis for fellowship.<p>There have been some in the past that have tried to adjust us. But we have told them that since we do not adjust them, they should not adjust us. Could everyone drive a car in the same way? This is why we have &#8220;backseat&#8221; drivers. When the car is driven by you, you must drive it. But when it is driven by others, you should let them drive it. Could you do this? Could you let others drive and not say a word? It is not so easy. If you drive a car in a certain way, you should not expect others to drive it in the same way as you. Therefore, we told the dear ones who tried to adjust us that as far as we were concerned, it was quite all right for them to do things in their way. We only asked that they would please give us the same freedom to do things in our way.<p>We must learn the lesson of grace in this way. We may practice many things for the Lord, yet we should not make any one of these things the basis for fellowship. When we practice the church life and take the standing of the unique ground of unity, we must not particularize in any thing. If we once particularize anything, we become a sect. If you prefer to speak in tongues, you should not expect the church to speak in tongues. If you expect the whole church to speak in tongues, you will make it a sect of speaking in tongues. The church is general, very general. It cannot specialize in any particular thing. But the problem is that if the church does not take your opinion or your way, you will say that the church is narrow. But really, it is you who are narrow. We cannot take anything special. We must be general. Then we are really not narrow, but, in fact, broad.<p>To be broad does not mean that we take in everything. To be broad means to be general, not opposing anything nor imposing anything. If you are of a certain opinion, you should realize that not all the brothers will have the same concept. We cannot expect others always to hold the same opinion as we.<p>We must be general. We should not be particular in anything. Wherever you go, do not make demands upon others. Perhaps their way is better than yours, or yours better than theirs, but this is not important. We must be so general that we may have the proper fellowship. The proper fellowship is not based upon a way or a practice. It is only based upon the same life within us.<p>Why must we always attempt to convince others? Why must we make them the same as we? As long as we all believe in the same Lord and are on the ground of unity, any kind of practice which is not sinful is tolerable. We must learn to give others the freedom to do things in their way.<p>We should never make anything a basis of fellowship. We must respect every local church, realizing that it has its own jurisdiction. San Francisco may prefer to use wine at the Lord&#8217;s Table, while another place may prefer grape juice. We must give them the freedom to use whatever they choose.<p>Why do we need to draw attention to this matter? It is because we have seen in the past that these things have created much trouble. That is why we must be general. Only the Lord Himself can be our basis for fellowship.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
