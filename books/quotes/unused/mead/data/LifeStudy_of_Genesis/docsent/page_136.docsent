   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Concerning the Woman a Suffering in Childbearing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the woman, God has ordained suffering or pain in childbearing Gen 3:16; 1 Tim 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The suffering in childbearing includes both pregnancy and delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The entire matter of childbearing, including pregnancy and delivery, is a matter of pain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not originally destined this way by God before the fall; however, due to the fall God ordained a portion of suffering for the woman, the leader in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may ask why God ordained suffering firstly to the woman and secondly to the man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did this because the woman took the lead in transgressing God's prohibition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, God came to her first.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was fair.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God had gone to Adam, Adam would have said, "Lord, don't come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was not the leader in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must go to the leader."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, God came to Eve first.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why do some women limit their childbearing?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because they want to enjoy a free life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is against God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all know that childbearing is troublesome, but it was ordained by God as a restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best protection to an unrestricted young woman is to have a number of children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although neither the woman's parents, husband, nor in-laws can restrict her, as long as she has some children these children will limit her undue freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Children are a restriction and a protection to their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Paul wanted the young women to marry and bear children that they might not be idle or busybodies 1 Tim 5:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>b The Ruling of the Husband</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord also told Eve that her husband shall rule over her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to this word, every sister should be under the rule of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did Eve fall?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because she did not care for her husband and assumed his headship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, God seemed to say to her, "Eve, from now on I appoint Adam to rule over you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>" Although this is a difficult word to accept, the Bible tells us that a woman must be ruled by her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all must take this word as a security and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ruling of the husband is a genuine safeguard to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in 1 Timothy 2:11-12 Paul says, "Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection; but I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul's teaching on this matter is based upon God's ordination in Genesis 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that the sisters will take heed to this divine word of the Bible.</S>
