<P>But thank the Lord that this was God's hand upon him. In Bethel God said that He would bring him back to the land. God promised that he would return. Before that, however, He first wanted him to know God's house. God was holding Jacob. He put Jacob in the house of Laban, a man who was as crafty, clever, and shrewd as he was, so that Jacob would be dealt with. During this period, Jacob began to learn to submit under the mighty hand of God. But this does not mean that Jacob as a person had changed. Jacob still devised methods to make the lambs spotted and speckled so that they would become his. Jacob was still the same old Jacob. Even Laban could not deal with him. Even though Laban changed his wages ten times, Jacob still had the way to come out ahead of him.</P><P>God had a purpose in Jacob. In order to fulfill His purpose, God disciplined him in many ways. He wanted to deal with his strong points. This was God's work which He wanted to accomplish in Jacob. He dealt with Jacob step by step. For twenty years Jacob was repeatedly wounded and he repeatedly suffered. On the one hand, God was working in him to discipline him. On the other hand, his flesh was still present, and he was as cunning and crafty as before. However, God did not give up working on him. Through all of his adverse circumstances, he eventually came to acknowledge God's hand.</P><P>After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob thought about returning home. But his days of discipline were not yet fulfilled, and he still had to submit under the hand of Laban. He could not leave one day too soon.</P><P>We should believe that everything that passes through God's hand is good. Our circumstances are arranged by God and are there for our benefit. Every environmental arrangement is for our benefit; it deals with the strong points in our natural life. We hope that God will not need to use twenty years to deal with us. But unfortunately, some people do not learn the lesson even after twenty years. Although some people have been tested and disciplined, they never advance; it is a pity that their flesh is never touched or weakened, and they are still scheming and supplanting. Brothers and sisters, we should not complain that God's hand is too heavy. God knows what He is doing. Originally, Jacob was a merciless person, but after he was disciplined by God, he became a kind and loving person in his old age. May we see that all our experiences in our environments are measured one by one by the Holy Spirit according to our need. No experience comes to us by accident. All the experiences we encounter are arranged by the Holy Spirit and are there to edify us. While we are passing through these disciplines and trials, we may not feel joyful or comfortable, but they are all part of God's work in us. Afterwards, we will realize that these experiences were all for our benefit.</P>
