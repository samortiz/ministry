   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A MODERATE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often say that someone has an abundance of emotions, but someone else does not have much emotion and therefore is cold, like a man of wood or stone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, we need to see that to be over-abundant in emotions is wrong, and to be too cold in emotions is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both are immoderate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A proper person is one who is moderate in pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether he is happy or sad, there is a fixed degree.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He laughs, but only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He weeps and is sorrowful only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His emotion is moderate and balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thirty years ago in a certain meeting in northern China I saw some conditions of immoderate emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the brothers and sisters prayed the degree of excitement of some was beyond description.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They shouted, clapped their hands, laughed, and trembled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They actually laughed to the point of going crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is hard to find a word in the dictionary to describe that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I also saw one weeping in a way that was simply unimaginable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even someone whose father or mother had died would not have cried with that kind of a voice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He wept with such great sorrow that it caused others to have a chilling sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These were displays of improper, excessive emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul tells us that we ought to be beside ourselves before God and be of a sober mind before man v. 13 . This is to regulate and temper our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without a moderate emotion you cannot pray properly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not right to have immoderate emotion, nor is it right to be lacking in emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some brothers and sisters who pray in the meetings are just like robots.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They pray without any expression whatsoever and sound exactly like a typewriter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While the conditions which we described earlier show an excessive emotion, a condition such as this reveals a shortage of emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both of these are conditions of an immoderate emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never consider this a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Bethany, when the Lord Jesus saw the condition of Mary and of the Jews and thought of the death of Lazarus, He wept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This, the shortest verse in the Bible, shows us that the Lord had emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in His weeping the Lord did not wail so as to cause those around Him to have a chilling sensation in their bones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Scripture simply says this word: "Jesus wept" John 11:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By reading the record you can tell that He was One with a very moderate emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On another occasion, when He cleansed the temple, He made a scourge of cords and cast out all the sheep and the oxen, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can say that He was thunderingly angry that day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But you cannot find any trace in the Bible indicating that on that day the Lord Jesus had made a great mess in the temple by breaking everything in it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With some brothers, if they do not lose their temper, all is well; but once they become angry, they create a big mess by breaking everything the windows, teapot, etc. Oh, how moderate was the emotion of our Lord Jesus! If you and I wish to be normal Christians, our emotions need to be moderate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether we are happy or sad, it must only be to a certain degree.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A SOUND EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man's emotion should not only be moderate, but also sound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moderation is a matter concerning degree, while soundness is a matter concerning nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You all know what we mean by soundness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With some brothers and sisters, when they laugh, it is a wicked laugh, and when they are sorrowful, it is a crooked sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their feelings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy are not sound.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, if a man can only laugh, but cannot weep, and never gets angry, he is most likely a false Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible says, "Be angry, and do not sin" Eph 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If one sins in his anger, his anger is unsound and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some weep and laugh with propriety, but others cry and laugh in an unsound, unseemly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All these unsound emotions are obstacles to our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, if we wish to be a normal praying one, we need an emotion which is both moderate and sound.</S>
