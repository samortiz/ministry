C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. In my youth I heard many Bible stories. At the age of sixteen I began to turn against all religions. In 1935 I graduated from school and became a teacher. I heard the gospel at Fourth Street in Chefoo through Brother Witness Lee, who preached on the sinful woman in John 8. God showed me that I was a sinner as well. I was saved in a clear way. After my salvation I consecrated myself to the Lord, daily caring more for the gospel than for my own food. This peak condition did not last long. Soon I returned to my hometown and became cold toward the Lord. I stopped reading the Bible and praying, and I became the same as an unbeliever. Later the Lord allowed sickness to come to me. At first I almost became blind. Later I vomited blood. Both my grandfather and father died of tuberculosis. In my sickness the Lord spoke to me, saying, "Fear not. Only believe. Nothing is impossible for those who believe." I lay in bed for sixteen months. Although I was extremely weak physically, to the point that I would fall on my knees when I tried to stand up, I was empowered in my inward being. In 1939 I returned to Chefoo, and the Lord gradually recovered my fellowship with Him. The Lord has cleansed me within and without once again.</p><p>During my time in the church, the Lord would not let go of me in many things. I began to coordinate with the brothers and sisters to serve the Lord in the church. I am a timid person. Spiritually speaking, I sometimes find it hard to stand upon my feet. Inwardly, I often feel dry and am fearful of hardships along the way. I once heard Brother Nee as well as Sister Wang say that this way is narrow and hard. Later I went to Brother Witness Lee. Through fellowship I became clear that I should quit my teaching job and give all my time to the church. In 1943 there was a great revival in Chefoo, Shangtung, and I consecrated my all. I consecrated not only my possessions but my self and my whole family to the Lord. My great-grandfather once mentioned me by name and consecrated me to the Lord. As I recall that incident now, I realize God has honored his consecration. This time I said, "From now on, I will offer myself to You. I will give up my freedom." I do not know what the Lord will do to me in the future. I know that He has created me and redeemed me, and I should serve Him in an absolute way.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother said that at times he could not rise up, that he felt dry within. I hope that you will ignore these feelings from this point forward. Whether or not you can rise up, you should let go of your feelings. You should only commit yourself to the hand of the Lord, believing that the Lord can accomplish everything. He will spontaneously bring you through. There are many problems that we cannot overcome by ourselves. However, when we look to Him and draw near to Him, the problems go away. When a caterpillar walks, it does not consider whether it should move its eighth leg or its tenth leg first. If it did that, the problem with its mind would become a problem with its walk. In the end it would not be able to walk at all. If it does not think about walking, it will have no problem in the mind. When there is no problem with the mind, there is no problem with the practice, and it walks.</p><p>The more you try to deal with your inner dryness, burden, and debilitation, the less you will be able to get through. If you consider them a problem, they will become a problem to you. If you forget them and let go of them, they will go away. Sometimes we overcome problems by warfare, but sometimes we overcome problems by forgetting them. Many things have to be overcome with power and strength. But sometimes they are overcome by simply forgetting them. If we boast in our weaknesses and give up our struggling and our ways, His power will overshadow us. The secret lies in praying for a vision of God's riches. We should see the Lord's glory while we study the Word, pray, or fellowship with the brothers in the meeting. Once we see this, we will forget our weaknesses. The inward filling often is related very much to our forgetting, and our forgetting is related very much to touching the Lord. Once we touch the Lord, we will no longer look at ourselves.</p><p>Our brother told us that he once vomited blood, but through prayer he was healed. Since he has been on the mountain here, he has vomited blood again. We pray that the Lord would be merciful to him and heal him. There are three things we should know with regard to healing. First, we should not tempt God. Second, we should not accept the symptoms of sickness. Third, we should believe in the sufficiency of His grace for us. Timothy had a chronic ulcer, and Paul advised him not to drink water. At that time the Jews dug water cisterns under their houses and either collected rain water or directed other water into these cisterns. There was bacteria in the water, and it was not sanitary drinking water. Paul advised Timothy to take some wine (1 Tim. 5:23), which could warm and invigorate the blood. Paul had the gift of healing, and he healed many sick ones. But he did not heal Timothy. Timothy himself was also gifted, but he could not heal his own ulcer. God had no word for Timothy. Timothy did not say, "I can drink water, and I can drink wine," because this would be tempting God. Paul said that he could take some wine. Timothy would not tempt God by drinking the dead water from the muddy cisterns. Outwardly speaking, there is no difference in the conduct of those who tempt God and those who trust God. The difference lies in the fact that one does not have God's word and the other does. Outwardly speaking, there is no difference in the conduct of those who walk by God's word and those who walk without God's word. But if one stands up to walk without having God's word, he is tempting God. If he has God's word, he can ignore all rules of hygiene. When he does not have God's word, he cannot act contrary to any natural law. In the Gospels, the Lord healed the man with the withered hand because He had spoken to the man. Once the man had the Lord's word, he did not have to wait for his symptoms to go away; he only needed to believe that he was healed. He could ignore the symptoms of his sickness, stretch out his hand according to the Lord's word, and be healed. The Lord's word is trustworthy; symptoms are not trustworthy. The lame man did not need to wait until he became strong to take up his bed and walk. When the Lord told him to take up his bed, he took up his bed. If we have God's word, we do not have to consider our pulse or our fever. But if we do not have God's word, we have to abide by the rules of hygiene. Once we have God's word, we can be extreme; we do not need to be afraid of anything.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
