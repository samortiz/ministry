 <h2 class="head1">FITTING THE LIVING BELIEVERS&rsquo; TASTE</h2>
<p>The third characteristic of the proper Christian meeting is that it fits the living believers&rsquo; taste. We all have different opinions and different views. But our opinions and views mean little; taste means everything. Do not argue whether something is sweet or bitter; just taste it. If it is sweet, it is sweet to your taste. Little children may not know the words <em>bitter</em> or <em>sweet,</em> but they have a taste. If you put something bitter into their mouths, they will spit it out. If you put a piece of candy into their mouths and tell them it is not good for them, they will still eat it because of the sweet taste. Some have come to our meetings full of criticism. According to their thinking, tradition, education, and knowledge, they had a critical opinion and view, but within their spirit there was a taste. While they were criticizing, the taste within told them that this meeting was right&mdash;life was here, the Lord&rsquo;s presence was here, the Lord&rsquo;s move was here, and the Lord&rsquo;s anointing was here. According to their educated mind, they would not take this kind of meeting, but their inner taste liked it. A number of the saints came into the recovery against their mind, their view, their education, and their philosophy just because of their inner taste. What convinces people is their inner taste. Our meetings must bear the characteristic of fitting the living believers&rsquo; taste. This characteristic impresses, convinces, and touches people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENOUNCING &ldquo;THE CUSTOMS OF THE NATIONS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Christian meeting according to God&rsquo;s ordained way renounces &ldquo;the customs of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). When we practice a church meeting altogether according to the God-ordained way, there is nothing natural; thus, nothing is according to the customs, the habits, of the Gentiles. The word <em>nations</em> refers to the Gentiles, and their customs are their habits or practices. In our meetings, we should not give people the impression that we have anything natural, anything as a habit, practice, or custom of the unbelievers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another expression that we must bear is that the ultimate goal in our church meetings is the building up of the Body of Christ. We need to realize the real meaning of this phrase&mdash; &ldquo;the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Whatever we do must issue in the building up of the Body of Christ, not merely in the building up of the local church in our locality. If we are merely building up a local church in our locality, that is not the building up of the Body of Christ but the building up of a local sect. What is the proof, the evidence, the sign, that our meeting is building up the Body of Christ? If our meeting builds up the Body of Christ, the saints who have been meeting with us for a while will be able to go to any locality and attend the meeting of any local church with no problem. They will have no problem because they are not only local but also universal.</p>
<p>When people go to another country and learn another language, it is hard for them to get rid of their native accent. Those of us from countries outside the United States may all speak English, but we speak it with different accents. We must endeavor to speak our common, universal &ldquo;language&rdquo; in the Body with no local &ldquo;accent.&rdquo; I have seen brothers visit other localities and give the saints the particular accent of their locality. Such a local accent is strong proof that the church does not meet absolutely for the building up of the Body of Christ. Rather, this so-called local church bears some sign of a local sect. A local sect is a so-called local church which is not universal but merely local. If we are simply local, we become a local sect, a local division, not the local expression of the universal Body of Christ. A local church must be a local expression of the unique, universal Body of Christ.</p>
<p>None of us in the churches should bear our local accent. We need to renounce any local accent. We may have been saved in a certain locality and raised as a Christian there for years. How can we stay away from the accent of that locality? This depends upon whether we insist upon our local accent or we renounce it, whether we impose what we are in on others or we sympathize with others, not imposing anything on them. Some may say that they have a Body-consciousness and that they are for the Body. But their kind of body may be somewhat different from the Body revealed in the Bible. The Body revealed in the Bible is universal. Their kind of body may be just the small group in their locality. Actually speaking, that is not the Body, but a restricted, local sect. We must remember that the meeting we desire to practice is one that really builds up the universal Body of Christ.</p>
