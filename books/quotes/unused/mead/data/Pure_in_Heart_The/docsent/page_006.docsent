   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE FIRST STEP AFTER SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PURGING OUT THE LEAVEN SALVATION AS THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a person is saved and becomes a Christian, he should know what steps he needs to take to progress in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible tells us that after a Christian is saved, he has Christ s life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Receiving the Lord s life, however, is only the beginning, not the end. To be saved and baptized and to possess Christ s life is the first step of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although a newly saved believer has the Lord s life in him, this life in him is very shallow; he does not yet have much progress in the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people have been saved for years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After so much time they should have deep and far-reaching progress in their Christian life, yet because they have not received the adequate leading and have not had the proper pursuit, they do not have much growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are continually treading over the same ground and walking in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This can be likened to someone who walks in the city of Taipei from morning to evening every day for five years, but never leaves the city limits, because the whole time he just walks in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He walks much, but he never advances; he spends much energy, but he never makes any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is because he does not take a straight path but walks in circles the whole time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In contrast to this, it takes only a few hours to travel by train from Taipei to Kaohsiung because the way goes straight and forward the whole time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians, however, are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although they listen to messages, read the Bible, and attend meetings all the time, they still have not made any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were like this five years ago, and today they are still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They seem to have a little understanding of doctrine, but concerning the Lord s life, they are still ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though they may understand Genesis 1, Matthew 1, and many teachings in the Bible, they do not understand the way of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although they study the Bible and have a share in Christ, they are strangers to the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are totally ignorant of what it means to follow the Lord and take His way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Progressing in the Christian life is similar to taking a train from Taipei down to Kaohsiung in the south.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the first station Panchiao, and the second station Taoyuan, we eventually will arrive in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All those who are advanced in the Lord s way know that the Lord s way is just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way of the Lord is station by station, with different levels and different steps.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ALLOWING GOD TO DO THE WORK OF CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first thing a saved one who wants to take the Lord s way must pay attention to is keeping himself absolutely clean and free from all defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may use an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a cup is dropped into a trashcan, after it is picked out, can we use it right away?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we want to use it, we first have to wash and sanitize it thoroughly, and then we can use it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before we have washed it thoroughly, we certainly cannot use it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the cup is not washed, then it has no function and cannot be used for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, we are like the cup; if we are not willing to allow the Lord to cleanse us, the Lord cannot do anything with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we want the Lord to work in us, we first need to be cleansed by Him thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We thank the Lord for saving so many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before we were saved, we all had fallen into the trashcan of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, to compare the world to a trashcan is to overestimate its worth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should say that the world is like a manure pit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, it is even smellier than a manure pit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, before we were saved, our entire being was defiled and full of germs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>None of us was clean in our thoughts or emotions; we were altogether filthy and evil within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, one day the Lord came; His gospel reached us, His voice entered into our heart, His Spirit sympathized with us, and we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord rescued us and separated us from sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we have been saved, all our defilement and germs have not been totally removed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They still are present in our flesh and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the first step that we must take after being saved is to allow God to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not allow God to cleanse us, we will have no way to start walking on the way of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, if we do not allow the Lord to wash us, the Lord will have no way to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether we are newly saved or we have been saved for years, we have to take such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although many of us were picked out of the trash by the Lord many years ago, until this day we have not allowed the Lord to do a cleansing work on all the germs and defilement within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although we may understand more doctrines, be familiar with more Christian regulations, and know more Christians than we did in the past, we have not walked a step further.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The problem is here: although we allowed the Lord to pick us out of the trash, we have never allowed Him to make us clean and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the defilement and germs are still within us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So in order for the Lord to work in us, He has to wait for our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we give the Lord our consent, He will do the cleansing work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are unwilling or reluctant, then the Lord will have no way to lead us or do the cleansing work in us.</S>
