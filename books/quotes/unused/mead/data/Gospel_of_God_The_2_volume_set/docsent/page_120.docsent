   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPENTANCE IN MAN'S MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIFFERENT FROM REPENTANCE IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The repentance that man talks about simply speaks of one thing: he is not willing to lower himself to the bottom rung.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He thinks that he should be at least one rung higher before God would grant him salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is repentance according to man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not the repentance in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am not saying that there is no doctrine of repentance in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the doctrine of repentance in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible even demands that man should repent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the repentance that the Bible talks about is different from the repentance that we talk about today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What then is the repentance that the Bible talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us now look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, the meaning of the word repentance in Greek is a turning of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mind is the thinking organ within man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, repentance as taught in the Bible is not a change in conduct, but a change in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word repentance just means a change in one's thoughts and has nothing to do with works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not have any connotation of a change in conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is as far as the meaning of the word goes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, in the New Testament, repentance is always used in reference to our past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It concerns what we have done in the past, what we have thought and said, and what we were as persons in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, we had certain kinds of concepts and certain views which we considered good and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, through the enlightening of God, our mind has a great turn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a turn with a view to future conduct, but a change from things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We change our view and evaluation concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Originally, we thought that it was a glory and a joy to deceive others and that the one who was deceived was such a fool because he was ignorant of being cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One might delight and glory in this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But what he once considered glorious, now he considers shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Repentance is not for the good of tomorrow, but for the wrong of yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Repentance is not saying what one should do in the future; it is a reevaluation in the mind, a changed view, and a different judgment concerning the things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Luke 13:3 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that if they did not repent of what they did, they would die like the Galileans did.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, repentance is to take a different view than before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is to see things in God's light, a light that is from above.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Acts we see the word repentance used many times.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 8:22 says, "Repent therefore from this wickedness of yours and beseech the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Simon was trying to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit with money, and Peter replied with a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told Simon that he had to repent of his wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that Simon should do better in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It means that Simon should repent of what he has just done, what he has just said, and what his thoughts have been.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Repentance is to deal with one's problems of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It means that there were great mistakes in what we did and that we should now have a different view.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Formerly, the thought was to spend a little money to buy the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now, this is seen as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should be done?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is now the need for a new view and a renewed evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By this we receive forgiveness.</S>
