   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The world may be likened to a large university.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A university is a system with many colleges, schools, and departments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a university there may be a school of medicine, a school of law, a school of business, and a school of liberal arts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such schools are the systematizing elements of the university.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the students in the university are systematized according to their major, and they study in one of the many schools.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The entire world today is a big "university" the university of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this university there are different "schools": the school of food, the school of marriage, and the schools of clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whereas most students in a university study in just one school, the worldly people, who have been systematized in the university of the world, may study in a number of different schools, taking many "units" at a time but never graduating.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are so busy and so occupied that they have no time for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will not say that they are too busy to eat, but they will tell you that they have no time to come to a meeting, to read the Bible, or to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have time for anything in the university of the world, but they have no time for anything related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the great university of the world, there is also a school of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are even a school of Christianity and a school of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the Jewish people were systematized by Satan in the school of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TURNING FROM JUDAISM TO THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostles and disciples in the early days were taught and trained by the Lord Jesus to realize something new, something absolutely different from Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They came to know Christ, and they saw the vision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They knew that Christ had been crucified and resurrected, that He had ascended on high, that He had been enthroned and had been made the Lord and Christ, and that He would come back to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They also had the vision of the church and realized that God would gather together His chosen ones and build them up as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They had been in Judaism, but they were turned from Judaism to the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CONSECRATION IN THE UPPER ROOM</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Acts 1 speaks of the upper room in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this upper room a group of about a hundred and twenty prayed for ten days in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They not only prayed, but they also consecrated themselves to the Lord, offering themselves to Him in a very real and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Three and a half years earlier, the Lord Jesus came to Peter by the seashore, and Peter offered himself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter left his job and began to follow the Lord Matt 4:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say that Peter consecrated himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Peter's experience in the upper room was something else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Peter had a new kind of consecration, not an ordinary consecration but something specific.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the seashore Peter gave up his job, indicated by his leaving his fishing nets, but in the upper room he gave up much more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to itemize the things Peter gave up in order to be in the upper room.</S>
