When God works on earth, He does so age by age. The reason that God has many age-turning moves is that men used by Him in one age often become fallen and fail to reach His goal. This forces God to turn the age, that is, to have a new start so that He can do what He wants to do in a new age.<p>We can see many cases like this in the Old Testament. God would bring in a new age by doing something through some people during a particular time. However, due to man&#8217;s degradation, that age would soon become fallen and degraded. It would become so degraded that God could not have a way with men on earth and could not do anything anymore. As a result, God would have to bring in a new age. Only by bringing in a new age could God do any work again. Unfortunately, the next age did not continue for long before it fell again. God once more could not do any work. Consequently, He had to bring in another age. When one reads the Old Testament, he can see that one age came after another had degraded. One age rose only to see it wane again. Another age rose and then also failed again.<p>I would like you to realize that God&#8217;s work in turning the age is always done through men. Before a new age is ushered in, there are always men in the previous age who are used by God particularly to turn the age. And in every age-turning work, God purposely uses young people. The two most obvious examples are Samuel and Daniel.<h2 class=head1>THE TURNING OF THE AGE BEING FOR THE BRINGING IN OF GOD&#8217;S AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION</h2><p>Samuel turned the age of the priesthood to the age of the kingship, whereas Daniel turned the age of captivity to the age of return. The age of the kingship brought in by Samuel, properly speaking, began with David. It came to its golden peak when King Solomon built the temple. At that time God&#8217;s authority was manifested through men; God was able to rule through men under His authority. At the same time, God&#8217;s glory was also expressed among men.<p>In those days in Israel, on the one hand, there was the throne of the house of David and, on the other hand, the temple. The throne speaks of God&#8217;s authority, and the temple, of His glory. One should remember that the glory of God filled the temple when Solomon consecrated it to God immediately after its completion. We know that there is symbolic significance in this. The throne and the temple among the Israelites show us that God desires to rule and to express His glory.<p>I hope that the young brothers and sisters will see these two things. God wants to have a throne on earth and a habitation on the earth. The throne speaks of His ruling, and the habitation speaks of the expression of His glory. Such an age was brought in by Samuel. On the one hand, he brought in a throne and, on the other hand, he brought in a habitation through this throne. This situation was quite apparent among the Israelites after King Solomon succeeded in building the temple. God established a throne and ruled through it and obtained a dwelling place, a place for His expression through which He manifested His glory among men. This period can be considered a very normal age.<p>However, this condition did not last long. Due to man&#8217;s corruption and Satan&#8217;s attacks, this testimony was destroyed. When Solomon was old, the age had become fallen. At that time it seemed that God&#8217;s throne was laid aside and His glory was neglected.<p>From King Solomon on, his descendants began step by step to fall further. At the time of King Ahab, their condition could not have become more fallen. By the end of the books of Kings, which was the very end of the age of kingship, everything had become degraded and desolate. There was no more of God&#8217;s throne or God&#8217;s glory. Both of these had disappeared. What could God do? God could only give them up and let them go. As a result, the enemies came in, and Jerusalem was destroyed; the temple was burned down, and all the utensils for serving God in the temple, together with the Israelites, were carried away to Babylon. It totally became the age of captivity because everything was carried away.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S FOCUS THROUGHOUT THE AGES BEING HIS AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION ON EARTH</h2><p>I have no thought of giving young people too much doctrine. Nevertheless, I hope that you would know something about God. In the first chapter of the Old Testament, after God created man, His focus was on two things: first, He wanted man to have His image, and second, to have authority on His behalf. From the beginning of the Bible, we can see that what God cares for in man are the matters of image and authority. From Genesis to Revelation, from the beginning of mankind all the way to the new heaven and new earth in the future, God&#8217;s special focus on man has been with these two matters.<p>Image indicates God&#8217;s expression. Suppose you are not presently in the United States. Your friend in the United States cannot see you. However, you can take a picture and send it to him. He will then know your image by the picture. You can print copies of this picture and send them all over the United States. You can even print it in all the American newspapers. In this way, everyone in America will see you. Hence, an image is an expression. In the same way, man is created in God&#8217;s image. In other words, man is God&#8217;s picture; he is an expression of God&#8217;s image. Someone once told us that a sculptor first takes pictures of a model from the front, back, right, and left sides, and then sculptures according to these pictures. In the end, the statue that he makes will be exactly the same as the image of the model. When you see the statue, it is as if you see the real person. Hence, an image is the expression of a person.<p>Please remember that expression is a matter of glory. Image is expression, and expression is glory. After Solomon finished building the temple, it was filled with God&#8217;s glory. That was God&#8217;s image expressed, and God Himself was manifested.<p>At the same time, there was the matter of authority, that is, the matter of the throne and the kingdom. Brothers and sisters, the Bible focuses all the time on the matters of image and authority.<p>If we realize this, we will understand the reason that in the prayer the Lord taught the disciples, He said, &#8220;For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory&#8221; (Matt. 6:13). The reason He said this is that in the beginning of the Bible there were these two matters, and at the end of Revelation there are still these two matters. I cannot speak in detail here. I only hope that the young brothers and sisters will have an impression that being a Christian is not merely a matter of being saved or just a matter of loving the Lord. What being a Christian concerns, touches, and relates to is something very significant; it has to do with the question of image and authority, of God&#8217;s glory and the kingdom.<h2 class=head1>MAN&#8217;S FAILURES THROUGHOUT THE AGES BEING AN OVERTURNING OF GOD&#8217;S AUTHORITY AND A FAILURE TO ALLOW GOD TO BE EXPRESSED</h2><p>Although from the very beginning God focused on the matter of image and authority, and although the work He did on Adam concerned these two things, we know that before God reached His goal, that age became fallen. This fall continued from Adam&#8217;s time to the time of the tower of Babel. At the time of the tower of Babel, men did two things. First, they denied God&#8217;s authority. Men collectively rebelled against God there, denying His authority. They said with a stern face, &#8220;Who is God? We do not know Him! We human beings are everything. We will build a tower reaching to heaven in order to proclaim our name. We do not know who Jehovah is. We only know ourselves!&#8221; In this way, they utterly overturned God&#8217;s authority.<p>Please remember that before the tower of Babel, no nation had yet appeared on earth. It was from the tower of Babel that nations of men began on earth. Men wanted to establish their own nation; they did not want God to rule. At the time when the age of the kings was about to begin, the Israelites did one thing that displeased God very much. They imitated the nations and desired a king over them instead of having God as their King. It was at Babel that men began to resist God&#8217;s ruling and tried to make themselves king.<p>At the tower of Babel, not only did men overturn God&#8217;s authority, but they worshipped idols. Archaeologists and historians tell us that in those days there were all kinds of idols on the tower and in the city of Babel. Idols are versus God&#8217;s image; they do not allow God to be expressed. Rather, they allow the demons to be expressed. Even today there is no country that is without a shrine; every country has its own shrines. What is a shrine? It is a place where Satan is expressed. At the time of Solomon, there was a throne in the nation of Israel which spoke of God&#8217;s throne and authority. There was also a temple which spoke of God&#8217;s expression. However, today&#8216;s nations have become Satan&#8217;s throne and the place where Satan rules. At the same time, every nation has its shrines and its places of idol worship. That is the expression of Satan. This is not simply a matter of human superstition or of the backwardness of civilization. Satan&#8217;s subtle work is in it. We must realize what Satan is always doing in the universe. What he always does is to establish a nation among men, instigating men to rebel against God and to deny His authority. At the same time, he sets up shrines everywhere in every nation for men to worship him so that they would express him. Everything that he does is to damage God&#8217;s authority and glory.<p>Consequently, God began to call Abraham out of the land of the tower of Babel. We cannot cover this matter in too much detail. If we read the experience of Abraham, we again see the matters of authority and expression. His story is one of many distractions and frustrations.<p>Later, the descendants of Abraham came out of Egypt and arrived in the land of Canaan. There they passed through many stages of degradation. Finally, Samuel came. God brought in the kingship through Samuel and turned the age. At Solomon&#8217;s time we can still see these two things: the throne (as soon as there is a king, there is the throne) and the temple. The throne is a matter of authority and the kingdom, and the temple is a matter of expression and glory. We can see a return to God&#8217;s original desire. Here, on the one hand, there is God&#8217;s ruling and, on the other hand, God&#8217;s image and His expression.<p>Not too long afterward, when Solomon became old, the condition of Israel became degraded again. Eventually, the majority of the Israelites were captured to Babylon. By then the throne was no more, the nation was gone, the temple was totally destroyed, and all the utensils of the temple were carried away to Babylon. Babel is a Hebrew word; Babylon is its Greek translation. The two refer to the same place in the land of Shinar.<p>Genesis 11 records the descendants of Adam moving to the land of Shinar. There they built the city of Babel and the tower of Babel to resist God. As a result, God forsook that age, that is, He forsook the descendants of Adam and chose Abraham, intending that his descendants would become God&#8217;s testimony-to rule for God and to express God&#8217;s glory-in the land of Canaan. In Daniel 1 the land of Shinar is mentioned again. The enemies had carried the Israelites away to the land of Shinar again. This means that they returned to Babel again. The story of Babel was repeated again with them. As soon as they entered Babel, they were fully under men&#8217;s ruling and the ruling of demons. There were Chaldean shrines in Babel. I have said earlier that shrines are places where demons are expressed. At this time, the nation of Israel was no more, the temple was destroyed, and the utensils for God&#8217;s worship were carried away to the land of Shinar and placed in the shrine of Babylon. This means that in that age God&#8217;s authority was no longer seen and God&#8217;s expression no longer existed. Everything had collapsed. It was at this time that God needed a man to turn the age.<h2 class=head1>THE RAISING UP OF MEN WHO TURN THE AGE FOR THE RECOVERY OF GOD&#8217;S AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION</h2><p>It was at this juncture that Daniel was raised up. Through Daniel&#8217;s being raised up, God&#8217;s people returned from Babylon to Jerusalem. Those who returned to Jerusalem were of two lines. One was the line of authority, which included men like Nehemiah and Zerubbabel who were David&#8217;s descendants. Among them were also some governors. The other line was the line of priests. These men expressed God&#8217;s glory in the temple. Men like Ezra and Joshua, the high priest, were Levites. Hence, their return was a recovery of authority and expression as at the beginning. One matter was to rule for God, because among David&#8217;s descendants rulers such as the governors were raised up. The other was the expression of God, because there was a return to the priestly and Levitical services of the temple.<p>In relating these matters, it is not my intention to tell some Bible stories. My only wish is that among the young brothers and sisters here, some would realize what is happening in the universe. If we realize what is happening in the universe, we will easily receive a burden. We will realize that in the present age also, God needs someone to rise up and to turn the age as Samuel and Daniel did. We should agree that the condition of today&#8217;s age is like that of Babel and Babylon and that God&#8217;s authority is denied on earth and His expression torn down.<p>In these days the whole world is celebrating Christmas. Look how they celebrate! Outwardly, they are celebrating the holy birth of Jesus Christ, but actually, they are in the flesh and indulging in their lusts. No dancing in the world is worse than the dancing on so-called Christmas Eve! People even call such a dancing party &#8220;the holy party&#8221;! This is how men celebrate Christ&#8217;s &#8220;birthday&#8221;! Not only do the Gentiles behave this way, but even many Christians also are carried away by the tide of this age. Many send Christmas cards to each other, greet each other with &#8220;Merry Christmas,&#8221; set up trees at home, and hang little light bulbs on them. It seems that if they do not do these things, they will not be fashionable. I am afraid that among the young brothers and sisters, some have also done this in the past. Please remember that all these are fallen things. Today all of Christianity has fallen into Babel. There is not a trace of God&#8217;s ruling, not a trace of God&#8217;s expression. It is altogether a condition of men forsaking God. In such a desolate age, God needs young people to rise up to turn the age.<h2 class=head1>MEN WHO TURN THE AGE BEING THOSE WHO CONSECRATE THEMSELVES VOLUNTARILY</h2><p>Let us now take a look at Daniel. How did God use Daniel to turn that age? There is an important principle with Daniel as also with Samuel. It is voluntary consecration. Samuel was a Nazarite. A Nazarite was a person who consecrated himself voluntarily (Num. 6). We can see the same principle in Daniel. Apparently Daniel was not a Nazarite. Actually he was, because a Nazarite was a person who did not drink any wine or strong drink. What is the meaning of not drinking wine or strong drink? It means not to enjoy any pleasures of this life. This is the principle with Daniel. Daniel would have said, &#8220;I do not want anything that the world considers sweet, joyous, or satisfying.&#8221;<p>Why did Daniel drink neither wine nor strong drink, nor partake of the king&#8216;s diet? It is because all these things were related to idols. What the king of Babylon drank, as well as his meat and grains, must have been offered to the idols. At least those meals were not clean according to the ordinances on cleanliness in Leviticus 11; it was defiled food. Daniel said, &#8220;I will not be defiled by that food. The young people of the world may participate in it. But I will not have a part in it.&#8221;<p>In principle, Daniel and Samuel were the same; both were Nazarites. Daniel refused everything that men enjoyed and boasted of. He refused everything that would offer him some position in the world. He was a voluntarily consecrated one.<p>Brothers and sisters, a little spiritual pursuit or a little godly living before the Lord is not enough to be used by the Lord to turn the age. All those who are used by the Lord to turn the age must be Nazarites; they must be voluntarily consecrated ones. I believe by now all of us know what voluntary consecration means. It means that when everyone else on earth seeks after the world and enjoys the world, I separate myself from it. This separation is a voluntary consecration. The Bible records that in those days the king of Babylon chose a group of young men from different races to stand before him. The opportunity of being chosen was something beyond one&#8217;s dream because the king would give them good food and drink for three years so that they would be fair and fat in the flesh to stand before him in the palace. Many yearned for such opportunity but were not able to have it. Yet Daniel and his three companions vowed, saying, &#8220;We forsake such opportunity. We will not enjoy the food and drink here. We cannot be the same as other people. We must take another stand. Other people do not have God and are not for God, but we are for God.&#8221;<p>At that time, Daniel might have been only a young man in his teens, yet the two matters of God&#8217;s authority and God&#8217;s glory were recovered in him. This young man with his three young companions accepted God&#8217;s authority and came under God&#8217;s authority. This is not all. We also see God&#8217;s temple and God&#8217;s expression with them. When Daniel&#8217;s three friends flatly refused to worship the idols, that was in fact a proclamation that they expressed God! They seemed to be declaring, &#8220;Although it is true that we are in the land of Shinar, we are not the people of Shinar. It is true that we are in Babel, but we are the descendants of Abraham. We cannot worship the idols here. We want to testify of this God of glory. We want to have the God of glory expressed in us!&#8221; On that day his three friends fully expressed God before the idols. The Bible records that after the king of Babylon cast them into the burning fiery furnace, he saw that the three persons whom he cast into the fire had become four persons (Dan. 3:23-25). The form of the fourth person was like the Son of God. Please remember that this was God being with them, in their midst, and expressed through them while in the furnace.<p>Of course, we must realize that they expressed God this way because they submitted themselves to His authority. While the whole earth denied God&#8217;s authority, they acknowledged God&#8217;s authority. While the whole earth had men as kings, they had God as their King. The whole earth was saying that they would eat and drink what the king of Babylon told them to eat and drink; to them, whatever the king of Babylon said counted. But these few said, &#8220;No, we are not under the authority of the king of Babylon. We are under Jehovah&#8217;s authority. Only His words count. If what the king of Babylon says is in accordance with what God says, we will obey. If not, we will not obey. We cannot go against Jehovah in obeying the king of Babylon.&#8221; Hence, this was not a question of not eating or not drinking, but a question of who is ruling over men. If we read the book of Daniel carefully, we will see that Daniel and his friends were truly under God&#8217;s authority and truly allowed God to be expressed through them. Whether they were bound in the land of captivity, were cast into the furnace, or were even cast into the den of lions, they allowed God&#8217;s glory to be fully expressed.<p>How could they be like this? It is because they were voluntarily consecrated ones. It seems that God had never called Daniel, nor had He appeared to him. (Of course, we believe that God was working there in a hidden way.) What we see from the book of Daniel is that these men offered themselves to God willingly.<p>In turning the age, God needs man&#8217;s voluntary consecration. In almost all cases of turning the age, God does not show us that it is the Holy Spirit who calls and seeks for men (the only exception being the case of John the Baptist). On the contrary, God shows us that every time the age is turned, God&#8217;s work is seen in a very hidden way; it is not so apparent to man. What is obvious to man is man&#8217;s voluntary consecration. With Daniel and his three friends, we do not see the outward work of the Holy Spirit. What we see is the voluntary consecration of these men.<p>The condition at that time was one in which the nation of Israel was in captivity, the temple was destroyed, and all the utensils within were carried away. God&#8217;s authority, glory, and expression were gone from the earth. Everyone had rejected God&#8217;s authority and was under the authority of the king of Babylon; they were expressing the demons and had become involved with the demons. Even the food they ate and the wine they drank had been offered to demons and was defiled and unclean. Yet at that juncture, Daniel and his three friends (who were very young then, Daniel probably being not more than twenty years of age) stood up and said, &#8220;While the whole earth is rejecting God&#8217;s authority, we will come under God&#8217;s authority. While the whole earth is involved with demons, we will be involved with God. We are here to express God. While the earth is drifting downward in this current, we four will go against the current and will go upward. We cannot go down with the tide. On the contrary, we will go upward against the tide.&#8221; Brothers and sisters, this is the secret for one to be used by God to turn the age! You can also be used by God to turn the age today, but the secret lies in your willingness to consecrate yourselves.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONSECRATE THEMSELVES VOLUNTARILY TO BE AN ANTI-TESTIMONY IN THIS AGE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, while I was considering before the Lord what to share, I had a strong feeling within that I should let the young people realize the importance of turning the age, and should show the young brothers and sisters the kind of persons God uses to turn the age. This kind of people are those who consecrate themselves voluntarily. While everyone else is going downward, a few persons are standing as an anti-testimony.<p>The whole book of Daniel was an anti-testimony against that age. All of the others were eating the king&#8216;s meat and drinking the king&#8216;s wine, but these four were not. All of the others worshipped idols, but these three would not do it. The others had stopped praying because of the king&#8216;s decree, but Daniel still prayed three times a day toward Jerusalem on his knees before God! This is the anti-testimony.<p>Brothers and sisters, let me say it again. What kind of persons can be used by God to withstand the age? They are the voluntarily consecrated ones! We can see this basic principle in both Samuel and Daniel. We must say, &#8220;I cannot do the things that the world does. I cannot take the way that the world takes. The world may follow the tide of this age, but I cannot follow it.&#8221;<p>Young people, you must realize that God&#8217;s testimony, including the authority and glory, has been destroyed in the tide of the world. Everyone who is used by God to turn the age must be one who consecrates himself voluntarily in the midst of this tide. He can stand up and declare to everyone, &#8220;I cannot follow this tide. I will be one who stands against the tide.&#8221; If you do this, God&#8217;s authority and God&#8217;s glory will be expressed through you.<p>If we read the book of Daniel, we will realize that God&#8217;s authority and God&#8217;s glory were both with Daniel. Daniel truly became God&#8217;s throne and God&#8217;s temple. In Daniel we see God&#8217;s ruling and God&#8217;s expression. Even the idol-worshipping Gentiles saw God&#8217;s glory and ruling in Daniel. No wonder that through this one person, Daniel, God was eventually able to bring the Israelites back to Jerusalem and to recover His authority and His temple among them. That turning point was totally because of Daniel. He was able to be such a one because he was a voluntarily consecrated one. He was willing to stand against the tide and be a testimony for God. This was a young man who could be used by God to turn the age. May God raise up young men like Daniel for the need of this age!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEN WHO TURN THE AGE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Dan. 2:17-18; 6:10-11, 19-22, 26; 9:1-4, 20, 17; 10:2-3, 12-13; 12:13</h1><p>Today we will consider the characteristics of the men who turn the age. In other words, we will consider the reasons those men who turn the age are used by God. We can see briefly from Samuel the kind of men God used to turn an age. From the record of the book of Daniel, we can further find out the reasons man was used by God.<p>In reading the book of Daniel, many pay much attention to its prophecies. No doubt, a large part of the book of Daniel shows us the matter of prophecy. But more important than showing us the prophecies, it shows us the crucial position of one who, in the midst of the conflict of God versus Satan, was used by God to turn the age.<p>In the conflict between God and Satan, man indeed occupies a very critical position. We can see from this book that God has His plan and Satan has his resistance. God wants to accomplish His plan on earth. Yet Satan tries in many ways to frustrate and destroy God&#8217;s plan. Between the two, man stands in a special position. If man takes the right stand, God&#8217;s plan will be accomplished and Satan&#8217;s subtle scheme will be destroyed. If man does not take the right stand, God&#8217;s plan will be hindered and Satan&#8217;s scheme will succeed.<p>The book of Daniel describes in a specific way the crucial position man occupies in the conflict between God and Satan. This position is one that turns the age. This position can cause God&#8217;s will to succeed and Satan to fail, or it can cause Satan&#8217;s subtle scheme to succeed and God to be frustrated. Therefore, we may say that whether an age can be turned depends on what position man takes. Man is between God and Satan. If man&#8217;s position is right, Satan will lose his control over that age and will not be able to frustrate the turn. This is what the book of Daniel shows us.<p>Now let us consider a few of Daniel&#8217;s characteristics which enabled God to use him for the turning of the age. I believe that the Lord will use this word to grant grace to us and work among us.<h2 class=head1>THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC-SEPARATION FROM AN AGE THAT FOLLOWS SATAN</h2><p>The first characteristic of Daniel was that he was a separated person. Everyone who wants to be used by God to turn the age must be a separated person. We must know that everyone in this age is walking on the same road and is swept into the same current. This way is a way that follows Satan. This way is initiated by Satan and is pioneered by Satan. This way is definitely far from God and is always going downhill. We can find this condition in the book of Daniel.<p>I hope that the young brothers and sisters will pay attention to one thing when they read the Bible. We cannot merely study an isolated text in the Scripture. We have to grasp the picture presented in the entire portion of the Word. Daniel is a short book. Because many descriptions in it are very brief, we must carefully try to understand the hidden meaning there.<p>For example, from the very beginning of its narration, we can see a picture of a place called Shinar. The land of Shinar was a place where men revolted and rebelled against God from the beginning. From Genesis to Revelation most of the cases of man&#8217;s rebellion against God happened in Shinar, which is Babylon (Babel). Here we see a ruler, a leader, who had dominion at that time over the most powerful regions on earth. We can say that at that time the whole earth was under the hand of the king of Babylon. Hence, this picture shows us how the whole world is under Satan&#8217;s hand. Here the king of Babylon is a type of Satan.<p>In Babylon there was no temple, only shrines. It was the place of origin for idols. It was also the place where idols were most prevalent. All idol worship in this world originated in Babel, which is Shinar and Babylon. From the first chapter of Daniel, we can see that the whole world was under the authority of the king of Babylon; they all served the god of Babel, were under Satan&#8217;s dominion, and were even worshipping Satan. The whole earth was under this kind of condition. Among them there was a people, the Israelites, who should have been separated. The Israelites did not belong to Babylon; they should not have been under Babel&#8217;s authority. They should not have worshipped the gods of Babel. They lived originally in the land of Canaan, a place away from Babylon. Among them they had only the temple and no shrines. They worshipped only God. However, by the time of Daniel 1, even the Israelites were carried away to the world of Babel. The people separated by God were carried away to follow Satan&#8217;s current. Hence, by then everyone, including the Gentiles and the Israelites, was under Babel&#8217;s ruling and was worshipping the Babylonian gods. In other words, they all fell under Satan&#8217;s ruling and were following Satan.<p>This is the picture that Daniel shows us from the very beginning. This picture clearly shows us that the whole world was under Babylon&#8217;s ruling and was worshipping the god of Babylon. Consequently, God&#8217;s authority was laid aside and God&#8217;s glory was not expressed. On the contrary, Satan had dominion and was ruling. He was expressed and was worshipped by men. This is the picture in Daniel 1.<p>At this time, although Daniel and his three friends were still very young, they stood up to be an anti-testimony. This anti-testimony is a separation. As soon as they stood up, there was clearly a separation from the world. It was as if others were waving a black flag and they were waving a white one. When we read Daniel 1, we must grasp the meaning of this picture. These men did not follow the tide of Babylon at all. They were the separated ones. They could not eat what others could eat. They could not drink what others could drink. They could not do what others could do. They were clearly different from others in everything. I do not know if the young people have ever realized by reading Daniel that even in his old age, Daniel was still a separated person. He did many things that no one who was in the world would do. Furthermore, he did not do the things that the world did. There was always a separation between him and the world.<p>Young people, you must realize that today&#8216;s age is the same as Daniel&#8217;s age; they are not at all different. Not only the Gentiles are under the ruling of Babylon; even the so-called people of God, so-called Christianity, are also in captivity. This is especially true during Christmas, when the whole of Christianity is carried away! Everyone in the world is walking on the same road, and everyone is swept into the same current. Not only do we see the whole world dancing, even those in Christianity are also dancing. Dancing has even come to Christianity.<p>Hence, everyone in the world, Gentiles and God&#8217;s people alike, has been swept into this current; they have all fallen under the same authority and are worshipping the demons. The Israelites in those days were only Israelites outwardly; in reality they were not much different from the Babylonians. They ate what the Babylonians ate. They drank what the Babylonians drank. They worshipped whatever idols the Babylonians worshipped. The situation is the same today. Many are Christians outwardly, but actually they are demon worshippers. They do what the Gentiles do. They worship whatever the Gentiles worship. They highly esteem what the Gentiles highly esteem. For this reason, the tide of the whole world has come under Satan&#8217;s ruling. Today, Satan has taken everyone captive and has made it impossible for God to do anything on earth.<p>Unless Satan gains man first, he cannot damage God&#8217;s will. Unless God gains man first, He cannot accomplish His plan. Man indeed occupies an important position between God and Satan. Since Satan today has carried away everyone on earth, the first characteristic of a person used by God to turn the age must be that of a strong standing and a clear separation from the world. Such a person must stand up and declare, &#8220;I cannot do what the world does. I cannot eat and drink what others eat and drink. I cannot walk the way they walk. I cannot have a part in the kind of life that they live. I am always somewhat different from them.&#8221; The first characteristic of those who turn the age is an absoluteness in standing on God&#8217;s side. Such a person sees through everything that belongs to the tide of this age. Not only will he not follow those things, but his heart grieves and burns because of them. With respect to many things, he stands in a position of separation and becomes an anti-testimony.<p>Young people are most susceptible to follow others in their manner of living. However, the first things Daniel overcame were in the matter of living, things related to eating and drinking. Many times young people feel that since others can do something, they can do the same. They feel that since everyone else is doing it, it is all right for them to do it also. Please remember that if we do this, we will become completely useless in God&#8217;s hand in the matter of turning the age. This is because we do not stand on God&#8217;s side, but rather on Satan&#8217;s side. If we do this, we can never be used by God to turn the age.<p>Hence, we must have a separation from those in the world. We must stand up and be an anti-testimony. Although the tide around us is downward, inwardly we are standing up against the tide. Others may play and amuse themselves, but we will not do the same. Others may have all kinds of cravings, but we cannot have the same. Of course, I am not suggesting that we be peculiar persons. That is not what I mean. Nevertheless, we must remember that in an age where the tide is downward, to be used by God as a person to turn the age, we must be separated persons; we must be able to stand up as an anti-testimony for God. This is the first necessary characteristic.<h2 class=head1>THE SECOND CHARACTERISTIC-BEING JOINED TO GOD&#8217;S DESIRE THROUGH HIS WORD</h2><p>Daniel was not only a person who read God&#8217;s Word regularly, but a person who was joined to God&#8217;s Word. This is the second characteristic. He did not read God&#8217;s Word for the purpose of finding out some knowledge or merely for finding out God&#8217;s will. Rather, he read to receive and to keep God&#8217;s commandments. We should believe that he refused the food and drink of the king of Babylon because he had read the five books of Moses. He must have read about the clean and unclean food from Leviticus and Deuteronomy. At the same time, he must have found out that God&#8217;s people cannot partake of any food that has touched the idols. Since he read these commandments and therefore knew God&#8217;s desire, he accepted them and applied them to himself. Hence, he was not a person separate from the Scripture. He was not merely studying the Bible.<p>When he read from the book of Jeremiah that God had ordained seventy years of captivity for the Israelites, and that after seventy years God would turn back to bless them, he immediately fasted and prayed. He did not read the Scripture in a dead way. As soon as he touched God&#8217;s desire through the Word, he immediately joined himself to that desire.<p>This was the way he read the Bible. This was why he could be touched by every word, by the light, and by the teaching in the Bible. After he read the book of Leviticus, he could no longer eat the unclean food. After he read the book of Jeremiah, he could not help but fast and pray for the restoration of God&#8217;s people. Whichever point he read, he joined himself to that point. Brothers and sisters, please remember that a person who turns the age for God must possess such a characteristic. When we come to God&#8217;s Word, we have to learn not to study for some scholarship or for some knowledge, but to find out God&#8217;s desire from His Word. Whenever we find out God&#8217;s desire, we must immediately join ourselves to that desire.<p>I believe that many young brothers and sisters read the Bible regularly. However, I am afraid that when you read the Bible, the Bible remains the Bible, and you are still you. For instance, the Bible clearly says that a believer and an unbeliever should not be yoked together. This word is very clear. Nevertheless, after you read it, perhaps you still make friends with unbelievers. This means that the Bible is the Bible and you are you. The Bible cannot affect your living, and you cannot be joined to the Bible. You read clearly from the Bible that God&#8217;s will forbids His children from being yoked together with unbelievers in everything. You should not befriend unbelievers. You should much less consider marrying an unbeliever. Yet you still befriend unbelievers and even consider marrying unbelievers. This means that your living is totally separate from the Bible. Such a person cannot turn the age; neither can he be an anti-testimony in a degrading age. To be an anti-testimony, one must read God&#8217;s Word, touch God&#8217;s desire from His Word, and must join himself to this desire of God.<p>The current of the entire world today is against God&#8217;s desire. If within you, you have touched God&#8217;s desire, your living must be an anti-testimony against the age and the tide. When you read 2 Corinthians 6:14 and find out God&#8217;s desire about believers and unbelievers not being yoked together, you should right away say, &#8220;Amen!&#8221; From that point on, you should be determined not to befriend any unbelievers anymore because this is God&#8217;s desire. Although some brothers and sisters among you still make friends with unbelievers, you cannot do that anymore. You will stand up as an anti-testimony. As soon as you find out God&#8217;s desire from His Word, you must join yourself to this desire.<p>Brothers and sisters, this was Daniel&#8217;s characteristic in those days. He was not like many Bible readers who treat Bible reading as an objective matter. This kind of Bible reading cannot touch God&#8217;s desire. Because you read the Bible apart from the Bible, the Bible can never get into you. Bible reading is useless to such persons. To read the Bible, one must join himself and his living to God&#8217;s Word. Any time you find out God&#8217;s desire from His Word, you must immediately join yourselves to this desire with fear and trembling. This is the second characteristic we find in Daniel. Every person whom God uses to turn the age must possess this characteristic. Only those who join themselves to God&#8217;s Word can be of real use to God!<h2 class=head1>THE THIRD CHARACTERISTIC-COOPERATING WITH GOD THROUGH PRAYERS</h2><p>Daniel had a third characteristic. He was a man who was always praying. His prayers were not at all common. His prayers were prayers that turned the age. Every time he encountered some crucial matter, he prayed before God. He believed absolutely in prayer. He believed in prayer because he believed in God and not in himself.<p>From chapter two on, the book of Daniel mentions Daniel&#8217;s prayers. Of course, I fully believe that in chapter one he prayed also. When he was eating vegetables only, I fully believe that he must have prayed every day. He declared before God and Satan that the health of his body did not at all depend on the Gentile food and drink. He believed in God&#8217;s care only. This was why he and the other three young men could still be strong even though they ate vegetables only. He believed in God&#8217;s care and he must have prayed much.<p>Chapter two shows us a picture, one in which everyone on earth was ignorant of the things of God. Not only were the Babylonian magicians ignorant, even the Israelites were ignorant. Why were they ignorant? It was because they were under Satan&#8217;s ruling and were following Satan. Here we see God coming in to vindicate. He vindicated by showing that Daniel and his three friends were different from all the other people. No one on earth knew the profound things of God but Daniel. In chapter one it was Daniel and his three friends who separated themselves. In chapter two it was God who vindicated them. The separation in chapter one was done by they themselves standing up. The separation in chapter two was done by God for them.<p>Here God raised up an environment. He caused the king of Babylon to have a dream. The strange thing is that the king was clear in the dream, yet he could not remember what went on in the dream after he woke up. Therefore, he called together all the magicians in Babylon, as well as all the wise and knowledgeable ones. None of them could tell or explain the dream. This is a picture. It shows us that all the followers of Satan on earth cannot understand the profound things of God. At that juncture, God vindicated Daniel. He showed everyone that here was one who was particularly separated. He was acknowledged by God, qualified to be used by God, and capable of speaking forth the mystery of God.<p>Here we must see and lay hold of a principle. Such a one must be a person who cooperates with God. And the highest expression of a man who cooperates with God is in prayer.<p>Before the king of Babylon called for Daniel, he declared that if none of the magicians or learned ones in Babylon under him could explain the dream, he would destroy them all. Among those who were to be killed were Daniel and his three friends. I fully believe that Daniel would have told his three friends to pray with him. There they afforded God the highest cooperation; they gave God the highest coordination. In their single-hearted prayer, God revealed to Daniel the dream. It was the dream of the king of Babylon, but now Daniel saw it also. Not only did Daniel see that dream in his prayer, he understood its meaning as well. This shows that Daniel was a person living before God; he depended on prayer to do what man could not do, and he depended on prayer to understand what man could not understand. He was a person who cooperated with God in prayer.<p>We should believe that Daniel would not have seen the dream nor understood its meaning if he had not prayed. The only reason he could see King Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream and could know its meaning was that he was a person living in prayer. Through prayer he afforded God the highest cooperation.<p>Sometimes I am reminded of the way books are printed. If you visit a printing factory, you will find plates filled with properly-set type on the printing press. Underneath the plates is the paper. When the press starts, sheets of paper are impressed with the letters from the plates. If the paper is not positioned in the proper place, nothing will be printed. If the paper is placed a little out of position, the image will not appear properly. If you want the plates to stamp the paper correctly, you have to position the paper correctly. In the same way, God&#8217;s desire can be likened to a plate. King Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream was a plate typeset with God&#8217;s desire. The plate was there, but it needed Daniel to be a piece of properly-positioned paper. If the paper was positioned correctly, the dream as a plate concerning God&#8217;s desire would spontaneously be printed on it. This position upon which God could print His desire onto Daniel was prayer. Had Daniel and his three friends not prayed at that time but rather been busy with other things, it would have been like the paper positioned wrongly. If the paper was positioned improperly, it would be impossible to print the letters from the plate. However, when Daniel came back from the king of Babylon, I believe that the first thing he did was to pray with his three friends. In this prayer, God printed His desire into Daniel.<p>The book of Daniel records Daniel as a person who could pray. What Satan wanted to deal with particularly was Daniel&#8217;s prayer. His prayer touched God&#8217;s heart and was able to fulfill God&#8217;s plan. Satan purposely wanted to deal with his prayer and to destroy his prayer. Chapter six especially shows us that Satan wanted to damage this praying person through the men under Satan. At least he tried to destroy his prayer and to render him unable to pray.<p>One remembers the story of King Darius who decreed that within thirty days, anyone who petitioned anything of any God or man besides the king would be cast into the den of lions. Satan&#8217;s subtle strategy was to utilize the men around King Darius to deal with Daniel, to stop Daniel from praying, and eventually to ensnare Daniel, the man of prayer. How did Daniel respond to this? He still prayed as usual and was not at all threatened by it. The Bible is very clear: &#8220;Three times daily he knelt on his knees and prayed and gave thanks before his God, because he had always done so previously&#8221; (Dan. 6:10). Nothing could stop Daniel&#8217;s praying. If Daniel had not prayed, Daniel would have failed. As long as Satan could destroy and stop Daniel&#8217;s prayer, Satan would win. Hence, Daniel&#8217;s prayer was like a stronghold on a battlefield.<p>We must realize that it was this prayer of Daniel which resulted in God being manifested as the living God. With Daniel, God truly manifested Himself as the living God. And this manifestation of God was due to Daniel&#8217;s prayer.<p>In chapter nine we see that as soon as Daniel read and found out God&#8217;s desire for the Israelites to return from captivity after seventy years were fulfilled, he immediately fasted and prayed. Some have the wrong concept that since God had spoken and ordained that the Israelites would return from captivity after seventy years, why was there any more need for prayer? Had God not spoken that He would bring them back? Indeed it is true that God had promised to bring back the Israelites after the fulfillment of seventy years. Yet there was still the need for man to pray. If God could not find a man to pray for this on earth, it would be hard to bring to pass the return of the Israelites after the seventy years. Daniel met God&#8217;s need. He was truly a man who cooperated with God through his prayer.<p>In chapter ten we see that not only was Daniel a praying person, but a persistent praying person. He asked God for understanding and for direction. He prayed and prayed steadfastly. The Bible tells us that he received God&#8217;s answer on the first day of his petition. From the first day, God had answered his prayer by sending an angel to show him what would happen to the children of Israel. Yet when the angel came to the air, he met Satan&#8217;s prince who withstood him. There was a battle. In other words, when God in heaven was about to join Himself to man on earth, He met Satan&#8217;s resistance, and there was a twenty-one day battle. Although God had already heard Daniel&#8217;s prayer, Satan resisted in the air and would not allow God&#8217;s answer to reach Daniel. Nevertheless, Daniel was a persistent praying person. He persisted in prayer for three seven-day periods. As a result, the angel came to tell him how God had heard his prayer and how He would deal with His people.<p>All of this shows us that Daniel was a praying person. He prayed every day, and he prayed for everything. Once I asked a young brother if he prayed. He said, &#8220;I pray every day.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What time of the day do you pray?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Three times a day at mealtime I pray.&#8221; I would say that prayers at mealtime do not count as prayer. There is not much use for that kind of prayer because it is prayer for the food. But Daniel&#8217;s prayer was not at all for the food. He always prayed with a single purpose and never prayed for himself.<p>Daniel&#8217;s prayer reached the highest peak. He asked God to do something for Himself. He prayed, &#8220;Cause Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary that has been desolated, for the Lord&#8217;s sake&#8221; (Dan. 9:17). I hope that we would circle the words &#8220;for the Lord&#8217;s sake.&#8221; We can see that his prayer was totally for God and not for himself. It seems as if he was saying to God, &#8220;My supplication here today is not for myself but for You. Even though I am asking You to do something, it is not for myself, but for You.&#8221; This was a very special prayer; it was also the highest prayer. Our prayers are ninety-nine and nine tenths percent for ourselves. Very few of them are for God. Only a person like Daniel, who prayed to God single-heartedly, can be used by Him to turn the age.<h2 class=head1>THE FOURTH CHARACTERISTIC-NOT CARING FOR ONE&#8217;S LIFE</h2><p>There is still a fourth characteristic. Daniel was a person who would sacrifice himself to be martyred. From the first chapter to the last, the book of Daniel shows us that a person who is under God&#8217;s hand and who is used by Him to turn the age is a self-sacrificing person. Every incident and fact shows us that he was a person who did not care for his own life. For example, when he chose to eat vegetables only, he did not necessarily have the assurance that he would be strong. If the more he ate, the slimmer he became, he would be killed by the king of Babylon. Yet he cared neither for life nor for death. He knew that the unclean food, the food sacrificed to idols, could not enter into his mouth, that he would not be defiled, and that he would keep God&#8217;s word. Because of this word, he was willing to lose even his life.<p>Later, King Darius decreed that within thirty days none in the kingdom could make petition of God or men. But Daniel still prayed. Even if he would be thrown into the den of lions, he would still pray. Humanly speaking, he truly had the spirit of martyrdom.<p>Brothers and sisters, all those who are afraid of what might happen to them, who are afraid of things that come from one direction or another, of this and of that, cannot be used by God to turn the age. Please do not misunderstand me. Let me say it in a plain way. Everyone whom God uses to turn the age is afraid neither of heaven nor of hell. He fears nothing. He is only afraid of one thing, that is, to offend God and to lose His presence. Anyone who hides, withdraws, withers, and changes his mind when confronted with difficulties is not of much use in God&#8217;s hands. God cannot use cowards. All those whom God uses to turn the age are bold ones. They are not bold in a wild or natural way, but bold because of their fear of God and their courage to confront difficulties.<p>In the past I have read a little of the record of Martin Luther&#8217;s Reformation. I was most touched by the scene at his trial. Those who sat in front of him were kings and noblemen, yet Luther stood before them fearlessly. He spoke a firm word to their face: &#8220;If what I preach is contrary to this Bible, I am willing to die, but if what I preach is according to this Bible, no one can kill me!&#8221; Such majestic words caused even those who loved him and were concerned for him to tremble. His words were too majestic. He was a man who was not afraid of death. This was why God was able to use him to turn the age.<p>Consider Daniel and his three friends. They did not care for their own lives at all. Listen to the words of Daniel&#8217;s three friends. How resolute and majestic they were! Although the king of Babylon seduced them in the most cunning and devious way, what did they answer? They said, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar,...our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver us out of your hand....But if He does not,...we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up.&#8221; Do you not remember the record of the Bible? When Nebuchadnezzar heard these words, he was full of fury, and the countenance of his face was changed toward them. Right away he commanded that the furnace be made seven times hotter than it was usually heated. Even the men who lifted them into the furnace were slain by the flames. The three of them would rather be bound and cast into a fiery furnace than to submit to the king. If they had been cowardly and afraid of death, surely they could not have testified for God at all that day and could not have been used by God to turn the age.<p>Today, we can cover only these four characteristics. First, we must be an anti-testimony. Second, we must read the Bible. Third, we must pray, and fourth, we must not care for our own life. These four characteristics can be seen not only in Daniel but also in all those used by God to turn the age. If we read the biography of Luther, we will see these four things in him also. Luther was one who stood up as an anti-testimony. He was originally a priest in the Roman Catholic Church. When he saw that the Roman Catholic Church did things completely contrary to the truth, he rose up and became a strong anti-testimony. Luther was also a person who read the Bible. He saw from the Bible that man is justified by faith and not at all by works. Immediately, he accepted God&#8217;s Word and joined himself to this Word. Luther was also a man of prayer. Each time he came across important issues, he would fight in prayers before God. At the same time, undoubtedly, Luther was one who cared not for his own life and was willing to be martyred for the Lord. Only this kind of person can be used by God to turn the age.<p>Young brothers and sisters, I feel deeply before God to speak such a word to you. You must see that the whole world today has followed Satan. God wants to gain absolute young people so that He can use them to turn the age. I believe that everyone who has received mercy from God today will surely respond to this matter. I believe these ones will surely want to touch God&#8217;s desire, be voluntarily-consecrated ones, Nazarites, and be used by God as an anti-testimony in this ever-degrading age.</body></html>
