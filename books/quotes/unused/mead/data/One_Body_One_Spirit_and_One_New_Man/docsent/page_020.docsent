   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING DELIVERED FROM RELIGIOUS RITUALS, PAYING ATTENTION ONLY TO THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition, there is another problem, that is, so-called religious piety.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may illustrate what religious piety is by the following example.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people are not satisfied with the present condition of our meetings because we shout, pray loudly, and release our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From their youth they have been taught that they must be careful with the way they walk when they enter a "sanctuary."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They must walk as slowly and as quietly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was young and was meeting with the Brethren, I was taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we met together, we were so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But that kind of silence is the silence of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only a cemetery is this quiet and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you go to a kindergarten, however, you will see little children hopping and jumping with much noise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would rather have a noisy, bustling kindergarten than a quiet, orderly cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Others criticize our meetings because it seems that there is no beginning and no end. Most Christian worship services on Sunday mornings have a set format; they begin with a hymn and end with a benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when you come to our meetings, a small sister in the corner next to the wall may say, "O Lord, hallelujah, amen!" and the meeting begins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not have preachers or pastors; sometimes everybody speaks in our meetings, and there is no benediction at the end. I would like to tell you, however, that there is no need to pay attention to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you pay attention to these things, immediately you will be far from the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can never forget the summer of 1932, when Brother Nee was invited to speak to the graduating class of a seminary in Huang County, Shantung Province, and I took a special leave of absence from work to accompany him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was the first time I had ever been in a meeting of the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I went in, I saw some of them rolling, some jumping, some laughing, and some saying, "I have seen a vision, a great, great light!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They called those things "holy rolling," "holy jumping," and "holy laughter."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There were several hundred people in the hall, but everyone was acting in his own way for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Nee could not speak the message until they were finished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later the pastor told everyone to stop, and finally he picked up a bell to ring.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Still, no one paid attention to him; everyone kept acting in his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was the first time I had seen such a situation, and I could not bear it or take it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the pastor had rung the bell for a very long time, everybody finally stopped, and then Brother Nee spoke a message.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After Brother Nee had spoken and left the platform, I accompanied him for a walk on the school campus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said, "Brother Nee, I cannot take their meetings with the rolling and laughing and jumping."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I thought Brother Nee would think the same way I did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, he did not say whether he approved or disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He simply said in a light, moderate tone, "There is no word in the New Testament that tells us definitely what is the right way to meet."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I heard this, I thought that Brother Nee approved of their way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later I learned that he did not necessarily approve of their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, because at that time he had a very clear vision and very clear light, when he listened to what I was saying, he knew that I was still in religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was very wise, however, and did not rebuke me; he said only in a gentle manner that the New Testament does not definitely tell us how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said this to deliver me from religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we truly know and experience the Son of God and truly become His Body, His fullness, we will not care for forms of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why from the beginning we have paid absolutely no attention to any regulations, especially in the beginning of the testimony in America.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1960 before I went to America, I spoke many messages in Taipei, hoping that you all could be delivered from rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I spoke over a period of about a year, but the more I spoke, the more you became dead; the more I spoke, the more you stopped moving.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when the Lord took me to America, because of the lessons I had learned in the Far East, right from the beginning I did not set up any forms among them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the Lord's great deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that today even our calling on the Lord's name, our pray-reading, our pray-singing, and everything we do will not become our forms.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is even possible that our meeting tomorrow will be very quiet yet still be full of the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must not have any rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My main point is this: You must see Ephesians 4:13, which says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not the oneness of any doctrine, but the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether shouting or whispering, whether being noisy or being quiet, these things are not important because they are not matters related to the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our faith is the Lord Jesus Himself, including His Person and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we continue to grow in Christ until the day we become full-grown, we should put away all these differences, which are like toys.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should pay attention only to our faith, which is the Person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I speak these things lest you be bothered by some practices.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must see very clearly that the church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is the fullness of Christ, and this fullness must grow up gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By our contacting Him more, receiving Him more, enjoying Him more, and experiencing Him more, He will be constituted more in our entire being and experienced out from our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the true church, the practical church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His fullness is His Body; thus, we can say that it is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord in Himself is the Head, and the Lord in all of us is this one Body.</S>
