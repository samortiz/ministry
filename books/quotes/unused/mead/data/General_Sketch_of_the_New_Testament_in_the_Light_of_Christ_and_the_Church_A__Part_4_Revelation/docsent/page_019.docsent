   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE UNIVERSAL BRIGHT WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TWO BEASTS Scripture Reading: Rev 12 13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first chapter of the second section of Revelation reveals a woman who brings forth a man-child 12:1-18 , and the last two chapters of this section also reveal a woman 21:2, 9; 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the beginning of this section there is a wonderful, glorious, universal woman, clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This woman eventually will be the wonderful and beautiful bride to match God, as the very habitation of God, the holy city, with God s testimony in it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Between Revelation 12 and 22, however, there is another woman.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This woman is the great harlot, the sinful woman sitting upon a scarlet beast 17:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is the evil woman in Matthew 13 and Jezebel in Revelation 2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This sinful woman is related and affiliated with politics, the kings of the earth, to form the mystery, Babylon the Great, which is also a city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in the second section of Revelation there are two women and two cities in contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to understand these two women, we need to understand the entire Scriptures because the entire Scriptures give us the record of the two cities of Babylon and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Babylon began from Babel in Genesis 11, while Jerusalem began from the tent of Abraham in Genesis 12.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tent pitched by Abraham, which was in contrast to the city of Babel, later became Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two cities, Jerusalem and Babylon, were always in conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually it was an army from Babylon that came to destroy Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following this, the recovery of the destroyed Jerusalem was carried out by those who came back from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the whole story of the Old Testament from Genesis 11 to the end of Malachi is simply a record of these two cities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After this, the New Testament reveals two women, which are the fulfillment of the two cities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE UNIVERSAL BRIGHT WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 12:1 says, And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This great sign corresponds with Joseph s dream in Genesis 37.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to verses 9 and 10, the sun represents Joseph s father, the moon represents his mother, and the eleven stars represent his eleven brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In principle, therefore, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars together represent the entire company of God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This woman is a universal woman, a heavenly woman, a sign seen in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this woman is not earthly but heavenly, we cannot say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, as some Bible students claim.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mary is too small; she is not universally great.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others claim that this woman refers to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the people of Israel are not God s heavenly people but His earthly people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are many reasons that prove that these other understandings of the woman are not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This woman represents three main dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sun represents God s people in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Luke 1:78 tells us that when the Lord Jesus came the first time, the sun visited us from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The dispensation of the New Testament is the dispensation of the sun shining on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That the main part of the woman s being is clothed with the sun indicates that the main part of this woman is the people of the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The twelve stars represent the patriarchs; before the age of the law, the patriarchs were shining and glorious as stars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The moon under her feet represents God s people in the dispensation of the law, which was not glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as the moon reflects the glory of the sun, the Old Testament time only reflected the glory of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the moon is not on the head of the woman but underneath her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the eyes of God all His redeemed ones are a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Old Testament tells us that the redeemed Israel was a woman before God, and the New Testament says the same thing about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, this woman is a composition of all the redeemed ones in these three main ages the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, and the age of grace but the main part of this woman is the redeemed ones of the New Testament time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Great Red Dragon against the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verses 2-4 say, And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The dragon signifies Satan, who is no longer a small serpent but a great red dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Red here signifies the shedding of blood caused by Satan s murders John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The dragon corresponds with the beast in chapter thirteen, because they both have seven heads and ten horns v. 1 . According to 17:3 and 9-10, the seven heads are the seven Caesars of the Roman Empire, and the ten horns are the ten kings of the coming restored Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seven diadems represent glory and authority, which Satan always seeks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The stars of heaven refer to the angels in heaven Job 38:7; Isa 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven indicates that Satan has deceived one third of the angels, who will be cast to the earth with him Rev 12:9 .</S>
