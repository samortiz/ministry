   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR OUR DAILY WALK Scripture Reading: Titus 2:2-6; Gal 5:22-23; Phil 2:15; 4:8; Matt 5:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the humanity of Jesus is necessary for the spiritual warfare and for the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would fight the spiritual warfare for the kingdom of God, we need a proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God needs man to deal with His enemy, Satan, and this man is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only one man is qualified to fight the battle, and this man is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since He is our person within, His humanity is ours to fight the battle for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, to serve the Lord in the church in a proper way, we need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his two letters to Timothy, Paul covered three kinds of serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He first spoke of the elders, the overseers or bishops different titles for the same person .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are the leading ones of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he referred to the deacons and deaconesses, the brothers and sisters who are the serving ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Deacon" comes from a Greek word which means one that serves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul also addressed the Lord's servants, such as Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, there are three kinds of serving ones in the church: the elders, the deacons and deaconesses, and the workers for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these serving ones need the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as the acacia wood was the standing element for the boards of the tabernacle Exo 26:15 , so the humanity of Jesus is the standing element in all the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether we are in the spiritual warfare or in the church service, we need the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this chapter we must see that the humanity of Jesus is also necessary for our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The humanity of Jesus is needed for fighting, for serving, and also for living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not have the proper humanity, our daily walk cannot be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE EXPOSURE OF OUR HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most of the older ones have already experienced the fact that the more we try to use our own humanity, the more we realize that it is absolutely disabled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of the younger ones may not yet believe that their humanity is so worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The older you are, however, the more you will recognize the depravity of your own humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we were sixteen years of age, we had a certain kind of confidence in our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But once we were sixteen, we began to realize how hopeless we were.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, after graduating from college, we realized that we were even more hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And by the time we were married, we were fully convinced that our humanity was fallen beyond repair.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many young sisters, before they were married, thought that they were indeed wonderful, but marriage became a real exposure to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After being married, although many would blame their husbands, they found out their true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we are in the church, where there is no darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything is under the light, and everything is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is nothing that exposes us like the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While we are in the church meetings, we are under the heavenly X-ray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our humanity is exposed so that we may see the need of the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet, when we are exposed by the heavenly light, we must immediately apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to pray, "O Lord, cleanse me from all of my past with Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Cover me with Your blood."</S>
