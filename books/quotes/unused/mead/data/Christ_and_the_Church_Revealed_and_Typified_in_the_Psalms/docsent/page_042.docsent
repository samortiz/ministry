   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRlST'S ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The third point in this Psalm is Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 18: "Thou hast ascended on high.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thou hast led captive a train of vanquished foes."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without Ephesians 4:8-11 we would not know what verse 18 means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But by this New Testament passage, we see that it refers to the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ has ascended on high, and the implication of His ascension is that all His enemies have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before He ascended, He vanquished every foe, including the last enemy, death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He conquered death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From our human point of view, Jesus was put to death by human hands; but from the heavenly viewpoint it was He Himself who walked into death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He simply took a little walk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He walked into death willingly in order to manifest His life power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He stayed there for three days, and He conquered death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Death did all it could to retain Him, but death could not hold its prey Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He walked into death, and He walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He walked right through death, and He conquered it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before dealing with death, He had already conquered everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Death was the last enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His emergence from death means that every foe, including death itself, has been vanquished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So He ascended triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And He led a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the enemies defeated by Him were the captives in this train, including Satan, and including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The train is a procession, celebrating His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we can tell Satan that he is defeated and we are defeated too; but, hallelujah, we can also tell him that we are victorious in and with Christ's victory, and he can never be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a real praise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn to praise the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How pitiful is the praise of many Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is something like this: "O Lord, we praise Thee that for the entire year we have not had one car accident."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The praise of others has improved a little, and they say: "Lord, Thou art the victor over my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But, brothers and sisters, we must see something much higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ has ascended, and He has led captive a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You were there, not just your little temper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Forget about having no car accidents, forget about conquering your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ has ascended on high!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And He has led a train of vanquished foes!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While He ascended into the heavens He made such a show, such an exhibition, in His triumphant procession before the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has defeated Satan and all the rebellious angels.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan and his host must flee!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And he has defeated all the rebellious people, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has led a procession of all these defeated foes as a praise to celebrate His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After showing them to the entire universe, He has, in a sense, shown them to His Father and said, "Look at the enemy and all his followers who were conquered and defeated by Me!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>CHRIST RECEIVING GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we have the issue of Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is that many of these defeated foes have been given as gifts by the Father to Christ for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These gifts, which are mentioned in Ephesians 4, are persons, not functions or abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers" these are the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Men such as Paul, Peter, and John are the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is as if, when Christ ascended to the Father with the train of vanquished foes, He said, "Father, look at these foes defeated by Me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the Father replied, "All right, let Me take some of those foes, let Me take Saul of Tarsus, and this one in Los Angeles, and that one in Houston.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I will give them to You as gifts for Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They were defeated by You, and now I will give them to You as gifts."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And He did.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Saul of Tarsus is a good example he was a real foe of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the ascended and exalted Christ came to visit him one day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had become exceedingly violent in persecuting Jesus, but when the Lord cast one look upon him he fell to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not believe the Ascended One used His hand, but that He merely looked at him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Saul was smitten to the earth, and he heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, what are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Saul replied, "Lord, who are You?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have been persecuting people on this earth; I have never persecuted the heavenly Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord said, "I am Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You thought you were persecuting James, John, Peter, and Stephen, but you did not know that you were persecuting Me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you know what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Ascended One captured Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Saul at that moment became a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>And Saul repented and said, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On that day the resurrected Christ got into him, and this foe, this vanquished foe, became a captive with the resurrected Christ in him as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was through this Resurrected One that this captured foe was made a gift, even one of the greatest apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this way the Lord Jesus received gifts in man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He captures people as the Ascended One, and He regenerates them as the Resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is by His resurrection life that He turns the captured foes into useful gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It was in this way that the Father, speaking of Paul, said to the Son, "I give this little one to You as a gift, and You must give this little one to the church as a gift."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Saul was later called Paul, which means "the little one."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Saul became a Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The foe of Christ eventually became a gift given by the Father to Christ and given by Christ to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Look at that captive Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How changed he was!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Read his history; see how he was changing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was transformed from such a persecuting foe to such a useful apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was a real gift to the Body, and Christ the Head received him as a gift in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>So many of us can testify of the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Before we were saved, we were the foes of Christ, but one day the Ascended One looked upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many times when I have considered how the Lord captured me and transformed me from a foe to one who serves Him, I fall down and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have nothing to say; all I can do is praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I deserve nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Nothing was done by me; everything was done by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Oh, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord is transforming so many foes into gifts for His Body, and He is doing it that the Lord God might dwell among them.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"Thou hast ascended on high.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thou hast led captive a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Thou hast received gifts in man, and even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell with them."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I think that today we are much more qualified to speak this verse than the Psalmist in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are in the Church, the house of God; we are in the dwelling place where God dwells through the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are the vanquished foes who are being made into gifts for the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are in the reality.</S>
