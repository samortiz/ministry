	 <h2 class="head2">The Compound Spirit</h2>
<p>The picture of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 shows that besides the humanity of Christ, His death and His resurrection have also been added to the Spirit. Olive oil, which typifies the Spirit, was compounded with four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. According to typology, myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the death of Christ. Calamus, a reed that shoots up from marshy ground, is a picture of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Finally, cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, which repels Satan and the demons. The olive oil being compounded with these four spices typifies the Spirit of God being compounded with Christ&rsquo;s death, the sweetness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. Today the Spirit of Christ is the compound Spirit, possessing both divinity and humanity. The Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, the resurrected Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being with Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; If the Lord were not the Spirit, He would have no way to be with our spirit. The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our regenerated spirit. We need to see the vision that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit. This matter was lost, but it has been recovered among us. Instead of discussing doctrines or practices, we simply need to enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to have a proper Christian living and church life, we need to enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit. We will be satisfied by Christ as the life-giving Spirit and will not be tempted to seek after worldly entertainment. Instead of forbidding our young people from participating in worldly activities, we should minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit to them. Nothing is more enjoyable than Christ. We need to partake of Him and minister Him one to another. When we are fully enjoying the all-inclusive Christ in the church life, we will not be distracted by the world. People seek worldly amusement when they do not have Christ as their joy. Christ is completely satisfying. The content of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not any outward practices; rather, the content is Christ, who is our unique joy and entertainment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being One Spirit with the Lord</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; It is a wonderful fact that we are one spirit with the Lord. If we realize that we are one spirit with the Lord and declare this fact, our daily living will be uplifted. It is our being one spirit with the Lord that makes us saints. The authority and impact of our Christian life and work are based on the fact that we are one spirit with the Lord. Because this item has been missed in today&rsquo;s Christianity, it needs to be recovered in our knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br />
IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:16-17 Paul prays, &ldquo;That He [the Father] would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; The inner man is our regenerated spirit. When we were regenerated, Christ came into our spirit. Now He desires to spread out into our heart, which is composed of our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Our spirit may be likened to the living room in a home, and our mind, emotion, and will may be likened to the inner chambers. Christ desires to spread into and settle down in these inner chambers. We need to pray, &ldquo;Father, strengthen me into my spirit that Christ may settle down in my heart, spreading into my mind, emotion, and will.&rdquo; For Christ to make His home in our heart is for Him to take over and possess every part of our inner being. It is to have our inner being saturated and permeated with Christ until every part becomes Christ. This is another item that needs to be recovered today.</p>
<p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; When Christ spreads into every part of our inner being to make His home in our heart, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. Our content will not be common, worldly things but will be the fullness of God. This will issue in a wonderful church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; This verse shows that the church as the Body of Christ is the corporate Christ. Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; Because we have been baptized into the corporate Christ in one Spirit, we are now positioned to drink of the Spirit. We have been put into Christ by being baptized into Him, and now we are taking Christ into us by drinking Him as the Spirit. In this way we are being mingled with Christ, who is the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of movements, activities, opinions, concepts, or gimmicks; instead, Christ is our all in all. We are in Him because we have been baptized into Him, and now He is filling us as we are drinking of Him. This is the church life, and this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. This vision of Christ being everything to us will rescue us from any kind of distraction. We need to drop all our concepts, opinions, and ways, and care only for Christ as our all in all.</p>
