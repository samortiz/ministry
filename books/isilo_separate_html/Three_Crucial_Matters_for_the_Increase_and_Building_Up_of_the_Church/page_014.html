<p>Apart from the general big meetings and the meetings to teach <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we also need a meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day to remember the Lord as our source and to fellowship with Him. In this meeting we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and remember Him as our source. Because we belong to the Lord, we must have a meeting to remember Him. The arrangements for this meeting must be very sober. The brothers and sisters have paid much attention to the table meeting, and more people attend this meeting than attend the other meetings. This is a good sign.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Small Group Meetings</h2>
<p>We also need the meetings in the homes, the small group meetings. We must practice the small group meetings in order to overturn the traditional Christian way of meeting. There is no form in the small group meetings; everyone can speak and function. It does not matter whether we refer to these meetings as home meetings or small group meetings; there is no need to argue about the name. We simply need to let people know that we have such a meeting once a week. It is best to have this meeting on Saturday. However, because Saturdays may not be convenient for some brothers and sisters, they can hold this meeting on another day. Whether this meeting is on Saturday or another day, all the brothers and sisters should open their homes once a week to have a small group meeting or a home meeting. This is a basic meeting.</p>
<p>The small group meetings are the foundation for building up the church. The three meetings we have discussed are for preparing the materials to build up the church. The general big meetings are for gathering the materials, the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> are for preparing the materials, and the table meetings are for maintaining the freshness of the materials. The actual building takes place in the small group meetings. The small group meetings are the foundation for building up the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prayer Meetings and Other Meetings</h2>
<p>The fifth meeting that we need is the prayer meeting of the church. We need the saints to pray individually, and we need all the saints to come together and pray at least once a week. This gives us five kinds of meetings that cover different aspects of the church life: the general big meetings, the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> in separate classes, the bread-breaking meetings, the small group or home meetings, and the prayer meetings. In addition to these meetings, there are other meetings, such as co-workers&rsquo; meetings, elders&rsquo; meetings, training meetings, and service meetings. We cannot make general arrangements for these other meetings. Each locality must make arrangements for these meetings according to their respective situations and needs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUP MEETINGS BEING THE BASE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We cannot eliminate any of these five meetings. The big meetings are for gathering people as the materials, and the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> are for preparing the materials. In the bread-breaking meetings our heart is turned to the Lord so that we can be burning toward Him, thus, maintaining the freshness of the materials. The prayer meetings are for the carrying out of the prayer ministry of the church. In addition to these meetings there is the small group meeting. This is the most important meeting for the building up of the church. The function of this meeting is to sustain the brothers and sisters, to recover those who have not been meeting, and to bring in new ones. The ability of the church to increase depends on the condition of the small group meetings, because in the small group meetings there are mutual fellowship, care, shepherding, and exhortation, which constitute the base for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>There are presently three or four thousand brothers and sisters meeting regularly in the church in Taipei. In the past the church in Taipei had only eight to ten elders, and there was no way for them to care for so many people. Presently there are more than eighty elders, but there is still no way for them to adequately care for all the saints. Therefore, all the brothers and sisters must function in the small group meetings and bear the responsibility to feed and care for one another. It is easy for eight to ten people, who meet together once a week in a small group meeting, to know one another. Moreover, even if they do not have any feeling for one another, after meeting together two or three times, they will begin to care for one another, because human beings are social by nature and rich in emotions. They will know one another and care for one another&rsquo;s condition, health, and job. Instead of feeling as if they are strangers, they will be concerned for one another and cherish one another. There will be a sweet feeling in the meeting.</p>
<p>In a society everyone has social relationships. No person wants to live alone for a long time, regardless of his social status, education, or financial condition. He will always want to return to society in order to continue his existence. The believers in the church life need to know that since the church is the assembly of the called-out ones, the members need to contact and fellowship with one another. We can testify that without the church our existence does not have meaning.</p>
<p>Some elderly people exercise by walking or running every day to maintain mobility. Other elderly people do not exercise their bodies or their minds, and as a result they become less mobile and deteriorate mentally. It is possible for them to forget how to return home if they go out by themselves. This shows that we cannot stop being active or exercising. Our bodies and our minds become stronger and more flexible when we exercise.</p>
<p>For example, even though I speak for one or two hours when I give a message, I do not feel physically tired. If I am not allowed to speak, I will not be able to eat or sleep well. I am more than eighty years old. I will become ill if I do nothing and do not give any messages. After giving a message, I frequently sleep peacefully and soundly through the night. I am presently working at least one and a half times more than I did ten years ago. In order to maintain my health, I force myself to walk at least half an hour every day. Without this exercise I do not have any strength. A person who lives to be eighty but is inactive or has no goal in his life may quickly go to his grave. The human mind and body need to be used. We should not stop using them simply because we are old. We should not retire too early, because early retirement makes people useless. We must continue working. In other words, we need regular and adequate exercise.</p>
<p>Our regular and adequate spiritual exercise is in the small group meetings. We must spend our energy on the small group meetings. The number of people in a small group meeting should not exceed ten. It is best if there are only seven or eight people. If the number in the meeting exceeds twelve people, the meeting should be split into two groups. Because human beings are social, it will not be easy for us to split a meeting after the saints meet together for a period of time. Initially the members of a group might not know one another, but gradually they will feel that the meetings have flavor because they know one another, care for one another, and fan one another into flame. Gradually, their number may increase to twelve, fifteen, or even twenty. Then they will feel that it is difficult to split the meeting into two groups.</p>
<p>However, a meeting that does not split into two groups will not spread. Therefore, the meeting must split. We hope that every home will have a meeting, and that these meetings will flourish and split until the home of every brother and sister has a small group meeting. In one of the large apartment complexes there are five households of saints who live next to each other. Some of these brothers and sisters have manifested their function. Therefore, we hope that there would be five small group meetings in that complex. Then everyone in that complex can be cared for.</p>
<p>We cannot give up the small group meetings. They have a specific function in the practical building up of the church. When we began changing the system, we said that everything we were doing was an experiment, because this was our first time to take the new way. We were in the experimental stage. In our heart we felt as though we were walking on thin ice, and we were trying different things. We have finished the period of research and experimenting, and we feel very good. In particular, we feel good that many brothers and sisters have a meeting in their home. It is not sufficient for the saints to fellowship only with family members; they need the group meetings. There is a need for fellowship among different families. For example, three families can come together to form a small group. There is a need for homes and for small group meetings.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
