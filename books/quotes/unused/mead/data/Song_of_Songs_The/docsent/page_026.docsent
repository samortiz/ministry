   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although there are still many lessons to learn and many things to know, the Lord is willing to be seen by the maiden, to be held by her, and to be taken away by her.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the present stage of dealing, she has passed through sufficient trials; her pursuit is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since she has not yet learned to separate the soul from the spirit, the Lord does not put any further burden on her.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although there is a mixture of the self, the Lord is willing to humble Himself and allow her to enjoy His presence once more.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we were sinners, we were conceived in lusts and born in sin.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She now seeks after the Lord's presence according to His grace and love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Poetically speaking, she is now bringing the Lord to an intimate place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She is a maiden, and her mother's house and the chamber of the one who conceived her must be a most excellent place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This concludes another section.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She has a good enjoyment of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this is not perfection yet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is still being pursued; He is still the passive One.</S>
