<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The revelations:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Triune God’s incarnation is to bring God into man, mingling God with man and making God one with man both in the divine life and divine nature (but not in the Godhead) and in the human life and human nature—John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16.</li>	<li>The human living of the man Jesus on earth is to express God in man through His divine attributes expressed in the human virtues of Jesus.</li>	<li>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To terminate the old creation with all its involvements—Satan, the world, sin, the old man, and the law with its ordinances—Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; John 1:29; Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:15.</li>		<li>To release the divine life from Jesus’ human shell for the dispensing of the divine life into the believers of Christ—John 12:24.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Christ’s resurrection from among the dead after His crucifixion is:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To designate (uplift) His humanity into the divine sonship, producing Him to be the firstborn Son of God—Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33.</li>		<li>To make Him, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit—1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>		<li>To regenerate all the people chosen by God, making them the children (sons) of God, members of Christ for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ—1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12; Rom. 8:16; 12:4-5.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Christ, as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God, in the evening of His resurrection, breathed Himself as the pneumatic Christ into His believers as the gentle breath. This indicates that the entire consummated Triune God as the consummated all-inclusive Spirit has been wrought into the believers of Christ as their life and everything. This is the consummating step of Christ’s ministry on the earth, that is, to have the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit of life join together with the believers’ spirit as one wonderful mingling spirit (1 Cor. 6:17); the divine Spirit indwells the human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and the two work together as one spirit (Rom. 8:16):		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The New Testament as the biography of Christ unveils to us that Christ as the Christ of God, the Messiah of God (John 1:41), the anointed One of God (Dan. 9:26, lit.), the appointed One of God, fulfills God’s commission to Him with a threefold ministry.</li>		<li>The threefold ministry of Christ is in three stages:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In the first stage it is His earthly ministry, which begins in His incarnation and ends in His breathing of Himself into His believers as the Spirit of life to bring His believers into an organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God—Matt. 28:19.</li>			<li>In the second stage it is His heavenly ministry, which begins with His outpouring, in ascension, of the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in Himself, as the Spirit of power to form the churches and ends with the building up of His organic Body. This has produced the overcomers and will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</li>			<li>In the third stage it is His kingdom ministry, which begins with His judgment of the believers at His judgment seat and ends with His judgment of all the dead at the great white throne.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>All the ministries of Christ in the three stages consummate God’s eternal economy in the New Jerusalem as the center of the new heaven and new earth.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
