<h2 class="head2">To Glorify God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:20).</p>
<p>The final goal of our consecration is to glorify God. To glorify God is to express God, to live Him out. The light shining out from a light bulb is its glory. We consecrate in order to put everything of ourselves aside and to let God become our everything so that He has the complete position within us to express Himself through us and to be glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Understanding the Will of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Present your bodies...prove what the will of God is&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:1-2).</p>
<p>The first result of consecration is that we can understand the will of God. Only those who are consecrated to God to live to Him can understand the will of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Able to Be Enlightened by the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:16).</p>
<p>The Lord is light. When our heart is turned from the Lord to something else, a veil covers us from His enlightenment. If our heart turns to the Lord, we can be enlightened in the light of His face. Turning to the Lord is our giving of ourselves to Him. It is a true consecration. Therefore, consecration can cause us to see the Lord&rsquo;s light. If we consecrate ourselves to the Lord from our heart, if we are turned toward the Lord, we will obtain His enlightening. Some brothers and sisters have no light because their heart has not been fully consecrated to the Lord. It is still attracted to things other than the Lord. Miss M. E. Barber said that a small leaf can cover the stars in the night. If we want light, we must have a complete consecration to take away every covering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Able to Have Faith</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Commit your way to Jehovah, / And trust in Him&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 37:5).</p>
<p>We must commit our way to God in order to trust in Him. To commit is to consecrate. To trust is to believe. Therefore, only a consecrated person has faith. If we do not let go of ourselves and our matters and place them in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, we cannot believe that the Lord will be responsible for us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Able to Have Spiritual Experiences</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not let sin therefore reign...Present yourselves to God...Sin will not lord it over you&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:12-14).</p>
<p>If we want to experience freedom from sin, we must consecrate ourselves to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:19).</p>
<p>We must present our members in order to experience sanctification. This verse and the preceding verses prove that consecration enables us to have spiritual experiences. Prayer, faith, joy, peace, overcoming, sanctification, and being filled with the Holy Spirit for power are all experiences that come out of consecration. This is confirmed by the experiences and writings of many saints who have gone before us. In order to have any spiritual experience, we must be consecrated. Consecration is a crucial gate. To enter into the reality of any spiritual experience, we must pass through this gate. We cannot expect any kind of spiritual experience without consecration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying All the Riches of the Lord&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;An acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God...God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:18-19; see also the verses related to the points above, &ldquo;Enjoying What the Lord Has Prepared&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaining the Lord&rsquo;s Blessing and Supply&rdquo;).</p>
<p>We enjoy all the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s glory through consecration. If we offer what is well pleasing to God, He will cause us to enjoy the riches of His glory.</p>
