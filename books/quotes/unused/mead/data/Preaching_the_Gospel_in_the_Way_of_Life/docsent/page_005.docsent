   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Helping People with Some Practical Verses</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, we have to tell people that if they are going to receive Christ as the living One, they have to make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They need to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt, we must tell them that their sins have been borne away by Christ and forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, for their experience of Christ, there is a need for them to confess all of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should help them to realize how many sins they have, how sinful they are, and help them to repent and confess their sins in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may ask how to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can tell them that they should confess according to what they feel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is nothing legal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They should simply contact the Lord and confess whatever they feel is sinful or dirty, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must also give people some practical verses from the New Testament, and sometimes from the Old Testament, to prove to them that they have really been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are four main items that we have to help them to see.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Showing Them That Their Sins Have Been Forgiven</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, by quoting some verses we must help them to know that their sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The remission of sins has been given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best verse concerning the forgiveness of sins is Acts 10:43, which says, "To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should read this verse to people and ask them also to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the way to point out this item of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the will there is such an item telling us that if we believe in His name, our sins are forgiven; the remission of sins has been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may also use Ephesians 1:7, but Acts 10:43 is the best verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way we must give people some practical verses from the New Testament to confirm them, to prove that what we have been preaching is not a theory but an item of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Showing Them That They Are Justified by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After reading the words in the will concerning the forgiveness of sins, we should read to them about justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the Word prove to them that they have been justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many such verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I prefer Acts 13:38 and 39, which say, "Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two verses tell us two things, that forgiveness is announced and that justification has been given in this One, that is, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may also use many verses from Romans 3 and Galatians 2, quoting the best verses to confirm that as long as a person believes in Jesus, he has been justified by God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the forgiveness of sins and justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Showing Them That They Have Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, we should read some verses confirming that they have eternal life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are many such verses, such as John 3:16 and 36, 5:24, 6:47, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need these verses to confirm, to prove, that they have eternal life in them.</S>
