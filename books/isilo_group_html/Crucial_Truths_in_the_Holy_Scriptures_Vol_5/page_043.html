<p>Since sufferings bring many benefits to believers, we should have a proper attitude toward sufferings.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That no one would be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we were appointed for this&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 3:3).</p>
<p>The believers must consider sufferings as something appointed by God. God did not appoint us to have enjoyment and rest in today&rsquo;s world. God appointed us to suffer. We must see this matter clearly so that we would not be shaken by sufferings.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 4:1).</p>
<p>The believers must not fear sufferings and must have a will to suffer; they must arm themselves with the mind to suffer in order to battle against sin and lusts.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Endure...suffering&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:20).</p>
<p>The believers must endure suffering. The endurance of suffering spoken of here is not related to suffering in response to sin and discipline. Rather, it is to endure suffering in anticipation of doing good works in order to keep our conscience clear before God and to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. This endurance of suffering is pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Suffer because of righteousness&rdquo;; &ldquo;Suffer...as a Christian&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:14; 4:15-16; see also 2:20; Matt. 5:10).</p>
<p>Believers must also suffer because of righteousness and as Christians. We should not forsake righteousness because we are afraid to suffer; we should not fail to keep Christ&rsquo;s testimony because we are ashamed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT THE BELIEVERS SHOULD DO<br />
WHEN THEY SUFFER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Does anyone among you suffer evil? Let him pray&rdquo;</strong> (James 5:13).</p>
<p>When the believers suffer, they should pray. Sufferings are a call to prayer. We must pray; only then can we be enlightened concerning the meaning of our suffering, and only then will our suffering be of benefit to us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God is faithful, who will not allow that you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>
<p>The Lord will never give us more sufferings than we can bear. Therefore, when we are suffering, we should believe that the Lord will surely make a way out for us and enable us to endure the sufferings.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Rejoice and exult&rdquo;; &ldquo;Count it all joy&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:12; James 1:2).</p>
<p>When we suffer, we should rejoice and exult; we should count it all joy because our sufferings are beneficial to us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Be humbled under the mighty hand of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Withstand the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:6; James 4:7).</p>
<p>The devil enjoys bringing sufferings to us, but God takes no pleasure in our suffering. God uses sufferings only to perfect us. Therefore, we should not seek to suffer, welcome sufferings, or pray for them. If we do, we will increase the enemy&rsquo;s attacks. God will not listen to any prayers that ask for sufferings, but the devil will hear and answer them with more of his malicious acts. When we suffer, we should humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, knowing that all sufferings are allowed by God, so that we would not rebel in the slightest way but cheerfully submit. At the same time, we should resist the devil, knowing that God takes no pleasure in our suffering. We should resist anything that God does not allow and ask God to save us from the sufferings imposed by the devil. We must say to God, &ldquo;I will accept what You allow, but I reject everything that comes from the devil that is not according to Your will.&rdquo; This should be our firm attitude whenever we encounter sufferings.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 5 &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
