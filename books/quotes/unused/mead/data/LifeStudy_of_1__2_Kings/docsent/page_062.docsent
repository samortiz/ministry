   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In particular, Elisha called things not being as being when he produced many vessels of oil from one vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus did the same thing in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 14 and 15 He fed multitudes with a few loaves and fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this matter also Elisha was a type of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>More than any other prophet, Elisha did things that, in type, were the same as what the Lord Jesus did in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle, Elisha and the Lord Jesus did the same thing, performing miracles of grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Resurrecting the Dead from Death</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are grace resulting in life unto the reigning in life as kings.</S>
