But as far as man&#8217;s fall is concerned, we are evil. Among the ancient Chinese philosophers, some said that man&#8217;s nature is good, and others said that man&#8217;s nature is evil. Actually, both are right. In a fallen man, there are these two opposing laws, one that compels him to do good, and the other that compels him to do evil. However, man does not necessarily know himself in this way. For this reason, God gave the law, which is the Ten Commandments, which exposes man&#8217;s true condition. The law of these Ten Commandments is the third kind of law. The sum total of this law is that God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. He forbids man to worship idols, and He tells man to honor his parents, not to kill, steal, commit fornication, or be covetous. In other words, He wants man to have love, light, holiness, and righteousness. God uses this law to expose man from without. After man is exposed, he becomes willing to walk by the law of God. However, when he sets out to keep the law, he discovers that it is not up to himself. He fails, and he is made a captive of Satan to do that which he does not will. He wills to love, but instead he hates. He wills to be in the light, but instead he is in darkness. He wills to be holy, but instead he is defiled by worldliness. He wills to be righteous, but instead he becomes unjust and unrighteous. Therefore, Paul drew a conclusion: &#8220;For to will is present with me, but to do the good is not&#8221; (Rom. 7:18b). Again he said, &#8220;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&#8221; (Rom. 7:24).<h2 class=head2>The Law of the Spirit of Life</h2><p>Paul finally knew himself. But he did not remain there. He discovered that in him there is still a fourth law. The first is the law of good in man&#8217;s mind. The second is the law of evil in man&#8217;s flesh. The third is the law of God given by God outside of man. The fourth is found only in those who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the law of the Spirit of life. Because we are created beings, we have the human law of good. Because we have become fallen, we have the evil law of Satan. Because we are before God, we also have God&#8217;s law. Prior to our believing in the Lord, there were these three laws: one in the mind, that desires to do good; one in the flesh, that compels us to do evil; and one outside of us, that puts a demand on us. God requires that we have love, light, holiness, and righteousness, but we cannot have them. For this reason, we repent, confess our sins, and believe in the Lord Jesus. Once we believe in Him, God comes into us to be our life. With this life there is a law. It is not the law of good, nor the law of evil. Neither is it the law of God outside of man. Rather, it is the law of the Spirit of life. This law of the Spirit of life is the Triune God Himself. The living Person of the Triune God is our life within us. This life has a law, which is called the law of the Spirit of life. Life, Spirit, and the law-these three are just one thing. This law is the Spirit, and this Spirit is life.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE BEING THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</h2><p>Exodus 30:23-25 speaks of the compound holy ointment. The compound holy ointment is composed of one hin of olive oil with four spices. The one hin of oil signifies the unique God. Olive oil signifies the Spirit of God flowing out through the pressing of the death of Christ. It is the base of the ointment, and it is the basic ingredient in which the spices are mingled. The four spices signify humanity in God&#8217;s creation with the precious death of Christ, the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, the resurrection of Christ, and the power and fragrance of resurrection, respectively. Hence, this compound ointment signifies the Spirit produced out of the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection. In this Spirit, there is divinity, humanity, the Lord&#8217;s death, resurrection, and His redemption. The supplying element of this compound Spirit is both bountiful and excellent (Phil. 1:19b).<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
