   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: What is the difference between our natural goodness and the goodness that issues from life?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: In the Bible, there are good people and bad people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people are good while some are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two kinds of goodness, as seen in the stories of Esau versus Jacob, and David versus Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Esau was an ethical man whereas Jacob was a crafty person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Esau never deceived anyone and, in terms of ethics, he was a virtuous man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the contrary Jacob was always a supplanter and a base person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the story of David and Saul, Saul wanted to kill David, but when David was given the opportunity to kill Saul, he did not kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The generosity of David was a kind of goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, Esau's goodness and David's goodness were different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The goodness of Esau came out of his own effort, but the goodness of David was the issue of the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By nature, many Christians may be like Jacob loving to supplant while many unbelievers may be generous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From such a perspective, many Christians seem to be inferior to unbelievers according to nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Take the case of Jacob, who was crafty from the time he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jacob cheated his brother, his father, his uncle, and his wives.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The name Jacob can mean "crafty" and "struggler."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although he was such a person, the Bible tells us that Jacob was the one that God loved Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From a human perspective, Jacob was far from being a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, he was dealt with by God to the point that when he reached old age, God changed his name to Israel Gen 32:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, when he blessed Joseph while he was dying, he genuinely and boldly said that God was the One who had shepherded him all his life 48:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that point he did not have any tricks; he simply bowed himself, leaning on the head of his bed 47:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he spoke, he spoke for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jacob's maturity in his old age was the work of God and was altogether different from Esau's natural nobility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the difference between natural goodness and goodness that issues from life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, although David was one who lived before God and had fellowship with God, when God's hand departed from him, he committed a sin 2 Sam 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When David's goodness was not sustained by the power of God's life, it did not last.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person is apart from God, he is evil and filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only when he is living before God is he a noble and upright person, having the genuine goodness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: Sometimes I cannot tell if a feeling comes from life or from my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can I discern between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Answer: If we love the Lord and put ourselves aside, we do not need to analyze our feelings; rather, we should simply follow the feeling we receive until we lose the sense of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First of all, as Christians we are like a woman who is married to the Lord 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The motivation for us to live such a life is that we are married to the Lord and we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we have to tell the Lord all the time, "Lord, I do this because I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, we also need to put our opinions aside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we do this, a sense will rise up within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we have to walk according to this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we do not have the peace within, we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When a Christian lives by the sense of life, it is not easy for him to feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he makes a mistake, however, he will lose his peace and then he will have some feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we should simply follow our inner sense and not analyze too much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not see the result right away, but when we look back after some years, we will be able to tell that we have made some progress.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, it is enough just to love the Lord, lay aside our opinions, and follow the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to analyze so many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: Is it a problem if our will is not strong?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Answer: A will that is not strong is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some people have a strong will by birth, but this natural strength has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the other hand, those who are not born with a strong will should ask God to strengthen their will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A will that is not strong is really a problem related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When life directs us from within and we follow the leading of life, gradually there will be a strengthening of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our will is not strong because our spirit is not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we allow the Lord's life to have the ground in us, our spirit will surely be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once our spirit is strengthened, our soul will be normal, and we will be delivered from all abnormal situations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people naturally do not have a smart mind, but because they love the Lord and are strengthened in spirit, they become clear in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some people were weak in their will, but because of their love for the Lord, their spirit became strong and their will was also strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, if our will is weak, we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Question: Is the word of God meant to teach us?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Answer: The word of God given to us seems to have at least two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, the word of God is for our teaching; on the other hand, the word of God is really a book of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is true that we may read the Bible to receive teaching and golden verses, but more often we should read the Bible in order to receive revelation and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the word of God touches our spirit and gives us a sense in our spirit, this is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes we take the word of God for our understanding and for us to have a clear mind.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is to take the word as teaching and is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In brief, this teaching is something of religion and of the mind, but revelation is something of life and of an inner consciousness.</S>
