   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST'S BELIEVERS BEING BROUGHT INTO THE UNION OF LIFE WITH THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AND MINGLED WITH THE CONSUMMATED GOD INTO AN INCORPORATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through the matters mentioned above all Christ's believers have been brought into the union of life with the processed Triune God and mingled with the consummated God into an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly, we had nothing to do with God, but regeneration has brought us into the union of life with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Union, however, is not sufficient to bring us into an incorporation with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be incorporated with the consummated God, we need to be mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, through Christ's glorification we have not only been brought into a union with the processed Triune God, but we have also been mingled with the consummated God into an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. God in His Divine Trinity Being an Incorporation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation John 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation both in what They are and in what They do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By Coinhering Mutually</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated by coinhering mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?" v. 10a . In verse 11a He went on to say, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me." The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son by a mutual coinhering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By Working Together as One</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation also by working together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 10b and 11b the Lord said, "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works....Believe...because of the works themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the Lord seemed to be saying, "You have seen all the works which I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These works were not done by Me, for I never did anything of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever I did was the Father's work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Father and I work together mutually."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This working together as one reveals that the Divine Trinity is an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. The Consummated Triune God and the Regenerated Believers Being an Incorporation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers are an incorporation John 14:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit Dwelling in the Regenerated Believers</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit, the third of the Divine Trinity as another Comforter, being the reality of the Son, the second of the Divine Trinity as the first Comforter and the embodiment of the Triune God, does not only abide with the regenerated believers but also dwells in them vv.</S>
