The first thing he asks when he goes to a place is who the authority is. There is an urge within him to ask, "To whom should I listen?" He does not say this with just his mouth; he manifests a need for submission within his very being. Submission becomes his very character. It is a characteristic of God's children to obey. This is the way a person acts when he touches authority. Under every circumstance, wherever he is, he looks for authority, for men to be above him. Wherever he goes, he finds the order of divine authority. If a good number of people gather together in a place, and they see things this way, there will be order in that place. God has placed order and authority in the universe, in the world, and in the church. Whether or not someone is good in our eyes and whether or not we approve of him, we have to thank the Lord for setting him up as an object for our submission. It is not a matter of who the person is, but a matter of the authority he has. If we cannot submit to him, we cannot excuse ourselves by saying that we are ignorant of authority. The only thing we can say about ourselves is that we are in rebellion. Those who know authority immediately know when a person is not in submission. When we say that we have to look for objects for submission, we do not mean that we have to look for an imperial officer to whom we should pay homage. We are saying that we have to submit to all deputy authorities. Wherever we go and under every circumstance, we have to look for objects for submission. If a brother or a sister says that he or she cannot submit to a certain person, there is something basically wrong with the nature of his or her Christian character.</p><p>When our Lord was young, He submitted to His parents. When He began His preaching at the age of thirty, a collector of the temple tax came to Peter and asked if his master would pay the temple tax. Peter answered the man, "Yes." After he came into the house, the Lord took the initiative to ask Peter, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?" Peter answered, "From strangers." The Lord then said, "So then the sons are free." But in order not to stumble them, the Lord asked Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook. Peter then found a stater in the mouth of the fish to pay the tax (Matt. 17:24-27). This incident speaks to us of authority. The Lord is the Son of God. Before He revealed Himself, men did not know Him. As far as His status as the Son of God is concerned, He did not have to pay the tax. In order not to stumble others, however, He paid it. Before He revealed His status as the Son of God, He subjected Himself to earthly authorities. He was the Son, and it was wrong for Him to pay the tax Himself because in so doing, it would imply a denial of His sonship. This is the reason He did not take the money from His pocket but paid it through other means instead. He ordered the stater to be taken from the mouth of the fish, and He used it to pay the tax. He paid His share, and He also took care of Peter's share.</p><p>When the Lord was judged by the high priest, He did not answer at first. But when the high priest charged Him by the living God to answer, He responded. This is another example of the Lord submitting to authority. This is the Lord's nature. As God's sons, we also have God's nature, which is a nature of submission. There is something within us that wants to submit. This is the characteristic of the nature within us. In the past we paid considerable attention to holiness but not enough attention to authority. Today we have to pay more attention to authority. We have to know that the nature God has given us is obedient and submissive. If we are not obedient and submissive, we feel inwardly unhappy; something within us will not let us go. If we have objects for submission around us today, but do not want to submit, I seriously question the kind of life we have received.</p><p>Here I must first ask for your forgiveness. In the past there have been many things which I was hesitant to speak about. I know that the time has come, and that I have to speak strong words to you. If your heart is set on submission, these words will be sweet to you! You were born in uncleanness but were saved and brought into the way of holiness. You appreciated the life that you received and felt inwardly relieved and refreshed. You will have the feeling again today if you are led by the Lord to choose obedience, to take obedience, to seek obedience, and to take care of the spirit of obedience. Actually, this feels so much better than merely advancing from uncleanness to holiness. What a joy this affords! You will thank and praise Him loudly, saying, "How sweet obedience is!" So many of our brothers and sisters are not happy or at peace because they are not willing to obey. Others are entering joy and rest through obedience. I know, of course, that certain factors make obedience difficult. Those in such circumstances must shed many tears in order to take the way of obedience. If, however, they obey in tears, they will be rewarded with joy and sweetness. May the Lord open your eyes to see that the life you have received is a life of submission.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
