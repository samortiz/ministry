   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Resurrection of Christ the Firstfruits</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the first day of the week ; The day after the Sabbath Mark 16:9; Lev 23:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The resurrection of the firstfruits was on the first day of the week, which was the day after the Sabbath in the Old Testament, as recorded in Leviticus 23:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It occurred on what the New Testament calls the Lord s Day Rev 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ 1 Cor 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The person who was raised as the firstfruits was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the record of the Bible, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were also raised after His resurrection Matt 27:52-53 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is according to the Old Testament type concerning this matter that points not to one grain but to one sheaf Lev 23:10-11 , which exactly corresponds with the facts related to Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Firstborn from the dead ; Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies...and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body Col 1:18; Eph 1:20, 22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the resurrection of the firstfruits Christ became the Firstborn from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was the first to resurrect from the dead, so He is the firstfruits of the resurrected ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, in resurrection Christ ascended far above all and became Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was made the Head of all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Resurrection of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being the Resurrection of Life and</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Resurrection from the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At His coming ; At the last trumpet 1 Cor 15:23, 52 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first resurrection is the resurrection that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This resurrection is not only from death but also from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This resurrection not only enables people to escape from death but also from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this resurrection only a small number of the dead are raised, which differentiates them from the other dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will occur when Christ comes back before the millennial kingdom at the time of the last trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are Christ s ; The dead in Christ will rise first 1 Cor 15:23; 1 Thes 4:16; see also John 6:39-40, 44, 54; 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who will participate in the first resurrection are the dead saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the last trumpet sounds and the Lord returns, the dead saints from all the ages will be resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The resurrection of life ; Raised incorruptible ; The dead in Christ will rise first...Be caught up together...and thus we will be always with the Lord John 5:29; 1 Cor 15:52; 1 Thes 4:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first resurrection is the resurrection of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All who participate in the first resurrection will enter into life with incorruptible bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will be caught up to the air and will always be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Resurrection of the Overcoming Saints</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In every age there are a few overcoming saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although they will be resurrected at the same time as the other saints, they will have an out-resurrection, a better resurrection, the top resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This can be illustrated by students at a graduation ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The top three students graduate at the same time as the other students, but their graduation is a special graduation, a graduation with a reward, a graduation with honors.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The resurrection of the overcoming saints will come with a special and glorious reward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to look at the portions in the Bible that speak of this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will rest and rise again in your lot at the end of the days Dan 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Daniel was an overcomer in a time of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse speaks of his rising again in his lot, meaning that he will not only rise again but will also enjoy the lot, the special blessing, that God has prepared for him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, his resurrection will be a resurrection with a glorious reward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous Luke 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that they will receive a repayment in addition to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, their resurrection must also be a resurrection with a glorious reward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who are counted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead Luke 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some are counted worthy to obtain the future age in the resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This shows that they are not only resurrected from the dead but that they are separated from the rest to obtain the future age.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that they will be kings in the future age, ruling over this world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, their resurrection will be a glorious resurrection of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That they might obtain a better resurrection Heb 11:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The resurrection given to some is a better resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that their resurrection will be different from ordinary resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this resurrection some will obtain a reward and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead Phil 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This word concerning the out-resurrection was spoken by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the context of the preceding verses in Philippians, this out-resurrection is something that will be attained and obtained by those who give up everything, suffer with the Lord, strive to pursue His reward, endeavor to run in the Lord s way, and are martyred for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the out-resurrection is different from the resurrection that Paul speaks of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There he speaks of the resurrection of all believers; here he speaks of a resurrection in which only those saints who are martyred for the Lord and who overcome can participate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Thessalonians speaks of a general, ordinary resurrection; Philippians speaks of a special, out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to the word in 1 Thessalonians, the apostle Paul is certain that he would obtain the general, ordinary resurrection, since all who die in Christ participate in this resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But in Philippians 3, the apostle does not have the assurance that he will obtain the special, out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He says that he counts all things loss for the Lord, suffers with the Lord, and is being conformed to the Lord s death so that perhaps he might attain to the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He does not consider that he has already obtained it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He continues to strive to pursue it, to run hard in the hope that he would obtain this special resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only those who are faithful to the Lord unto death can participate in this special out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the saints will be resurrected, but only those who are faithful to the Lord unto death will participate in the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As long as a student passes, he will graduate, but only the top students in the class will graduate with honors.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although other students graduate, they will not receive a prize or obtain honor.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Similarly, every dead believer will be resurrected, but not all will receive a resurrection of reward, the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only those who have overcome will obtain a reward in addition to being resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, the resurrection that they obtain is a resurrection with a reward; it is a special out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years...This is the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years Rev 20:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The resurrection referred to here is the first resurrection because it speaks of the resurrection that occurs before the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It also says that this resurrection is the first best resurrection because the ones resurrected are rewarded to reign with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Greek word translated first is the same word that is used in Luke 15:22 for best in the best robe.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The first resurrection is also the best resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Those who have part in the best resurrection will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Christ for a thousand years, ruling over the earth in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>These are the overcoming saints who bore the Lord s testimony and were martyred for God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are the only ones who will participate in this resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Resurrection of the Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Being the Resurrection of Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The thousand years were completed ; The end Rev 20:5; 1 Cor 15:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The final resurrection is the resurrection that will bring the unbelievers to judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The time of this resurrection will be after the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The rest of the dead ; The dead, the great and the small ; Those who have practiced evil Rev 20:5, 12; John 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Those people who will be in the final resurrection are the unsaved dead, not the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After the millennial kingdom, the dead will be raised to be judged to determine their eternal destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The resurrection of judgment ; Standing before the throne...The dead were judged...according to their works ; Cast into the lake of fire John 5:29; Rev 20:12, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The people who participate in this final resurrection will be judged and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After they are resurrected, those in the final resurrection will stand standing signifies that they are living before the great white throne to be judged according to their works.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then they will be cast into the lake of fire to perish eternally because none of their works will be approved.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All of these points are the story of resurrection.</S>
