   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE CITY AS THE ENLARGEMENT OF GOD'S HOUSE Scripture Reading: Neh 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After recovering the building of the temple, there is still the need to build up the city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the city, there is no protection for the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The temple is complete; it is the place of the Lord's presence, where we meet and serve the Lord; but it needs protection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wall of the city is the defense to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the wall of the city, there is no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a type which we must apply in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament, the building of the church is first mentioned in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Peter declared that Christ was the Son of God, he was told that the church would be built.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church comes after the knowing of Christ; after we experience Christ, the church comes into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time the Lord told Peter that He would give him the keys of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the kingdom follows the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three things are necessary: Christ as the rock, the church, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ must be experienced, the church must be built up, and then the kingdom will be brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Epistles, the church is the house of God this is mentioned in both Ephesians 2:19 and 1 Timothy 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the last two chapters of Revelation, there is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And in that city there is no temple Rev 21:22 , because the city has become the enlargement of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know what Christ is, and in a sense we all know what the church is, but not many are familiar with the city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE INCREASE AND ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the divine and eternal center.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He comes into me, into you, and into so many others, there is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This increase of Christ is the church John 3:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ increased, Christ enlarged, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the enlargement of Christ and the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all are parts of Christ and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My hand is a member of me and a part of me; even my little toe is a part of me because it is a member.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how small you are, as long as you are born of Christ, you are a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes people ask me what kind of Christian I am.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What they really want to know is whether I am a Methodist, Presbyterian, or Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The best way to answer is to say that I am a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is the kind of Christian I am.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not part of a Presbyterian group, but part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are all parts of Christ, and all of these parts put together are the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are all parts of the Body, the fullness of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we look at a certain brother, we see a bit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the bits and parts added together become His fullness which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is the fullness of Christ, because Christ has been increased and enlarged into so many members.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But what is the city?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The city is a further enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first step of the enlargement of Christ is the church as the house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second step of this enlargement is also the church, not as the house, but as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church as the house must be enlarged to be the church as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The city is something larger and safer than the house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, the whole house becomes the city!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation 21:22 says that there is no more temple in the city because the temple has become the city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The city is the tabernacle, the dwelling place Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The city is the enlargement of the temple, the development of the house to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The building of the house and the city is the center of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This building is simply the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Christ comes into us, that is the mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ mingles Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the church is a mingling of divinity with humanity, a divine mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When this mingling is enlarged and consummated to the fullest extent, that is the city.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So the city eventually becomes the mutual building, the mutual habitation, of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God dwells in us, and we in God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Oh, this is really marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the universal, eternal mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are His dwelling place, and He is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On a small scale, this is the house, and on a large scale, this is the city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible from the first page to the last takes this as the central theme.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have mentioned before that the Bible is like a painting of a tiger with thousands of items in the background.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The main figure in the painting is the tiger.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not a painting of a mountain, a bridge, or some trees; it is a painting of a tiger.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All these other things simply constitute the background.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible is a painting of the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are thousands of other items, but they are simply the background; they mean little.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The main figure is the divine mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The mingling is of four figures: The first is God, the second is Christ, the third is the church, and the fourth and final is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are the main figures of this biblical painting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we have the revelation of this mingling, the whole Bible will become transparent from the first page to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Otherwise, it is veiled to us.</S>
