   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 3 Date: August 25, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling BASED ON THE LORD AS A FRIEND TO SINNERS Not Needing Very Much Truth for Salvation,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Coming to God Only with a Sincere Heart</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message, we saw from the New Testament that many people were saved without being very clear about the gospel truths.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of the influence of tradition, many gospel preachers think that they need a great deal of truth and a thorough and lucid presentation of the gospel that addresses the entire range of human problems before men can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many workers do not expect men to be saved immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They try to help people to understand many doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, the salvation of many people is delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sinners also procrastinate in their decision because gospel preachers have this attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They think that they have to be a little clearer about the gospel and understand a little more about the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Often, they delay their own salvation through their perceived ignorance of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are experienced in this matter and have thoroughly researched it, we will agree that some have not received much truth before they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet they have stepped forward with a simple heart to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These ones bear a much stronger testimony before the Lord than those who are saved only after understanding a detailed exposition of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our preaching of the gospel, we should always exercise ourselves to discern how much truth a person needs before his heart will turn to God for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible every person who was saved did not turn after understanding many doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They only knew a little, but it was enough for them to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In preaching the gospel, we do not have to apply a heavy dose of doctrines; a little truth is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The extent and amount of the truth needed for the occasion depends on our own judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All that is needed is for a man to understand enough for his heart to turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spending Time to Study How Men Are Saved</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First we have to ask ourselves: How much Bible truth did we understand when we were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In studying the examples in the Bible and in reviewing the history of our own salvation as well as those of others, we find that many people were saved by listening to just two or three sentences of gospel truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people are even saved by hearing something totally unrelated to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Indeed, a man's salvation is not dependent on the amount of words he hears concerning salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As workers, we have to keep a record of the kind of words that precipitate salvation in various kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will realize that not everyone is saved by great, long sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, many are saved by one or two words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their hearts are stirred up to touch the Lord, and they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we have done such a study, we will become wiser in our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will find that everyone in this world is more or less the same; there are not too many different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ways men accept the gospel can be grouped, at the most, into a few categories.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people are saved by one kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others are saved by another kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Men can be identified by types, and there are not too many different types.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some people are of a certain disposition, and they are saved by a certain kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we meet a person of similar disposition, we can lead him to salvation with the same kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It takes time to research and study the way people are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do this, we will become very skillful at leading men to Christ.</S>
