   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit's Mingling with the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this oneness there is the mingling of the Spirit with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this mingling there is a divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether we realize it or not, this dispensing is going on all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is like the digestion and assimilation of food in our human body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every day digestion goes on without us realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is only when our stomach is sick that we have any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When our digestive system is working properly, we do not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit is dispensing, moving, anointing, and operating within us all the time in a smooth way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He is dispensing, we may not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we do not go along with Him, He will be grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why Ephesians 4:30 says that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Spirit is grieved, it means that He is frustrated from working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Pentecostal Christians consider the experience of the Spirit as something extraordinary; but actually, the dispensing of the Spirit works in a very normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit Being</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the Essence of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Spirit is the intrinsic essence of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As such an essence, He is sealing us day by day Eph 1:13; 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not only sealed by the Spirit, but are, even more, sealed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is the sealing ink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is not only the One who seals but also the ink with which we are sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This sealing ink never dries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It remains wet within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As it is sealing, it is also saturating and permeating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are like a piece of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Day by day the Spirit as the essence is saturating us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His saturating is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This dispensing continues quietly within us until we are fully permeated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit Bringing In the Hope of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which is Christ in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>as the Hope of God's Calling</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of dispensing of the Spirit brings in a hope Col 1:27; Eph 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This hope is the redemption of our body, in which our entire body will be soaked and permeated with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today Christ is hidden within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in that day, the hidden Christ will become manifested as our glory Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will permeate from our spirit through our soul and to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That will be the aggregate and the totality of God's divine dispensing in us.</S>
