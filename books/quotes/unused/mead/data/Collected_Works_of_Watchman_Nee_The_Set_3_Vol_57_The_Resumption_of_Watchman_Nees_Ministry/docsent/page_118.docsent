   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We expect to see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel and all the brothers and sisters serving God together, rather than three or five people serving by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The works that the church has to do include: first, the preaching of the gospel, which should not just be the responsibility of those who are giving the messages; second, there is the gospel visitation, which is conducted in the homes; third, there is the visitation of the new believers; fourth, there is the perfecting of the new believers; and fifth, there is the care for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Preaching the Gospel Mobilizing All the Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first kind of service is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers responsible for the preaching of the gospel should promote the gospel work in all the districts, schools, and other places.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These few brothers should not just be responsible for the preaching itself but should be responsible for mobilizing others to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not our work can be successful depends not only on how well the responsible brothers are serving, but on how much the other brothers and sisters are serving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today in Christianity there are no priests; there are only pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But among us we have to put all the one-talented ones to use.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When all the one- talented ones rise up, we will have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we replace their functions, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The right thing to do is to help them along in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not Being Negligent</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Not Being Covetous for Gain</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time, if you are a person who is not serious and who is loose and irresponsible, you cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You cannot serve God in a careless or negligent way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am not hired by the church; I am not receiving the church's salary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am not a hireling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am here to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As such, I cannot be negligent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others may have to sleep on the floor in order to get their work done.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have to be more desperate than they are; I have to sleep under the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a man cannot be negligent in serving the earthly things, how much more must he not be negligent in serving God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not here for money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to serve the Lord, we cannot ask anyone for anything, not even a bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We serve because we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone Participating</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every week we should have a gospel meeting, and every brother and sister should invite people to come to this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This should be the responsibility of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Never allow the brothers and sisters to develop the habit of asking what the meeting that night is about.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it is going to be a gospel meeting, do not let them say, "All right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will go home and sleep.''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have to say to such brothers, "No. Now that you realize it is a gospel meeting, you have to rise up immediately, because you have a part in this meeting.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gospel Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and Visitation of the New Believers Being Baptized as soon as One Is Saved</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The responsibility of visiting the new believers is quite heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the church assigns a certain brother to visit someone, this brother should take the one who introduced the new one to the church along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as a person is saved, he should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting a while to be baptized, they became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as a person believes, he should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he is baptized and something happens later, he will not feel so free to deny his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Whole Church Working,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bringing Increase in Quantity and Quality</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In arranging the visitation we should divide up the city into districts according to the map.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once the time is ripe and there is a certain number of ones desiring to be baptized, we should baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do this, we will double our investments in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No other period of time affords as much opportunity as today for the work to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the whole church rises up, there will be no place to hold the blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Within one to two months a thousand people were saved in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone who is born this way will be an eight- to nine-pound baby; no one will be a twelve-ounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator.</S>
