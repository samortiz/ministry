	 <h2 class="head1">PRACTICING UNTIL WE ARE SKILLED</h2>
<p>When we preach the gospel, the most important thing for us to learn is how to use the Bible and how to be flexible in using the Bible. We should spend time to practice. We may not thoroughly understand the contents of the gospel even after reading many books. We should endeavor to memorize verses and the main points from the books so that we may freely speak the gospel. In this way we will be able to speak freely with people concerning the gospel, using any verse. We must practice until we are skilled. If we are well-versed in all the points of the gospel, whether we are preaching the gospel on a campus or in a home gathering, the people we contact will be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING TO THE VILLAGES TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>From this time onward, we must promote the gospel on the island of Taiwan. First, every home must preach the gospel. Second, we must preach the gospel to people in every occupation. Third, we must preach the gospel in middle schools and on college campuses. Fourth, we must go to the villages and towns to preach the gospel. We can all go to the campuses to preach the gospel. Many of us must go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel. It would be good if every meeting hall in every church could send one small group of saints to preach the gospel in the villages every Lord&rsquo;s Day. We must spread the gospel and not merely have meetings. In particular, in the future the full-timers who are in this training should go to other places to preach the gospel. According to Matthew 10, we should go out to preach the gospel. We go out in groups. Several brothers and sisters can form a group and go to a village. They can stay there for three to four days and preach the gospel there.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of five brothers in America went to different places that do not have a church and preached the gospel on the campuses. They went to a university in the state of Louisiana, but they were turned away by the school authorities. Later they had a meeting with the president of the university, who allowed them to stay there and even provided a place on campus for them to preach the gospel. Many students in that place have been baptized. In the same principle, we need groups of four to five brothers and sisters to go to villages and towns. I believe that the Lord will arrange for many Taiwanese-speaking saints to go to the villages. In the future the young ones should spend a long time in the villages to preach and spread the gospel. We should not be in a hurry to establish churches. We should first be diligent to preach the gospel. All the full-time trainees should be the first group to learn these lessons and go preach the gospel. Based on these instructions, we should find the relevant information from the books and study on our own or with companions so that we are equipped. The results depend on how much effort we put in. Hence, we need to study and work hard. The young people must not be idle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: At present, there is a good response among the college students to the gospel, but it is not easy for them to be baptized. Some students feel that to be baptized is to join a religion and are concerned about the opposition from their family. Other students who have a positive response to the gospel want to wait until the time is right to be baptized. How can we help the students take the next step and be baptized?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must pray and ask the Lord to give us the economical Spirit. Preaching the gospel requires power. We must pray for this, but we should not take the way of the charismatic or Pentecostal movements. We should tell the Lord to give us the experience, not feelings; we want to experience the economical Spirit. For a person to be willing to believe requires the work of the Holy Spirit. For a person to be willing to be baptized requires even more of the work of the Holy Spirit. Merely using methods to persuade people to be baptized is human manufacturing. We must look to the Lord to give us the economical Spirit; we need the presence of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the best way is to take people to the mountain. It is not so easy to lead people to be baptized if we are in a home or in a school; however, if we take people to the mountain and spend a few days together, it will be very easy to lead them to be baptized. Human beings are living organisms with feelings and emotions. A person will respond one way when he feels cold in one setting and differently when he feels warm in another setting. So we must consider these two factors: the economical Spirit and the setting.</p>
<p><em>Question: Recently more than a hundred young people were gained and baptized. We hope that they can live a normal Christian life and can also preach the gospel to others. However, since they have recently been saved, it is not possible for them to know the Bible well or to have read many spiritual books. Is it possible to collect crucial verses with simple explanations into a booklet so that these young people can become familiar with these items in a short period of time and use them to speak to others?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Everything depends on us. We have the materials, but we need some saints to dig out the treasures, to digest them, and to compile them into booklets or tracts. This is the right method, and it will be useful. Furthermore, in the future we can compile material from these treasures that would be suitable for children&rsquo;s meetings. We should not use worldly material for the children&rsquo;s meetings. We should digest the main points of the truth and turn them into simple words so that we can speak the truth to the children.</p>
