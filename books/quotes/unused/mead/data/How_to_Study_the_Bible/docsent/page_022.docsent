   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They drew back and fell to the ground" John 18:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord simply spoke one sentence, and they drew back and fell to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What a glory we find here!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our Lord prayed at the garden of Gethsemane, but He did not plead for anything at the court, before the high priest, or before the magistrate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This One is far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the Lord, yet He was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who was actually judging whom?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The high priest was the one who was agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was the one who stumbled in words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Lord remained calm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He appeared before the magistrate, it was the latter who became nervous; he was the one who was aimless in his questions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord did not bother even to answer the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus of Nazareth is God.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the Son of God, and He does not need anyone to supplicate for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He asked the disciples to pray because He did not want them to enter into temptation Matt 26:41 ; He was asking them to pray for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we can observe once again the Lord's dignity and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He lived in poverty on earth, yet He did not ask anyone for any money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He prayed to God in the garden, yet He pleaded with no one in the court.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is like the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The throne is glorious, but the glory of the judgment and the cross is even greater.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to worship Him and say, "You are Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We find a similar case in John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's own brothers did not recognize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They told Him, "Depart from here and go into Judea for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His brothers said this because even they did not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet He said, "My time has not yet come" v. 6 . After His brothers went up, He also went up to the feast, not to perform any miracles there, but to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we touch our Lord's glory.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord never wanted to purposely expose Himself before men.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to understand the history both in the Old and the New Testament, we have to have the right impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to have the proper impressions, we have to be a tender person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason we have to go through proper lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a person has a low discernment, he cannot be expected to appreciate the dignity of the Lord Jesus when he reads the Gospels.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If he does not know the meaning of dignity and glory, how can he be expected to form an impression of the Lord's dignity and glory?</S>
