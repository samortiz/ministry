   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST CHERISHING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the New Testament, Christ s care of the church has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The inner aspect is the nourishing, and the outer aspect is the cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be nourished is to have something imparted into us inwardly, whereas to be cherished is to be warmed and comforted outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Cherishing is related to environment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our environment or circumstances the Lord Jesus is often real to us as a warm, tender breeze blowing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As this warm breeze comes upon us, we have the sense of being soothed tenderly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although this takes place in the environment, it is something more than the environment itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is even something that surpasses the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord s presence becomes a gentle breeze, we experience His cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This cherishing includes soothing, comfort, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the environment of the church life, we often experience the Lord s cherishing, although we may not even be conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if for any length of time we are in an environment where there is no church, we sense that the climate has changed and that the environment is different.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we begin to sense that we have lost something, that the tender, warm breeze is no longer blowing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may have everything necessary for our material existence, but we know that something we formerly enjoyed is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we return to the church life, we immediately and spontaneously enter into the environment and atmosphere of the Lord s cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once again we are warmed, soothed, and comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as a child is cherished by the very presence of his mother, so we are cherished by the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My little granddaughter often desires simply to be intimately in her mother s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simply to be in the presence of her mother is a comfort to her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The presence of her mother provides a tender, warm atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In like manner, the Lord s presence produces an atmosphere of tenderness and warmth to cherish our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We experience such an atmosphere in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am saddened whenever there are saints who do not care for the meetings, but prefer simply to have fellowship in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how enjoyable the fellowship may be in your home, the atmosphere there is not nearly as cherishing as the atmosphere in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How pleasant is the spiritual climate in the gathering of the saints!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As soon as we enter this atmosphere, we are cherished by the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is by the atmosphere produced by the Lord s brooding presence that the Lord cherishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be in this climate, this atmosphere, this environment, gives us rest, comfort, healing, cleansing, and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No atmosphere can compare to the atmosphere of the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason I do not want to miss even one meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nourishing and cherishing go together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through the nourishing we enjoy the supply of life inwardly, and through the cherishing we experience the soothing, comforting atmosphere outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we are in an atmosphere of cherishing, we can absorb every word of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that under the cherishing we receive nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A church that is nourished and cherished in such a way will be strong and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The nourishing and the cherishing are the church s portion, and they should be found in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If there is no nourishing and cherishing in the meetings, then there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The problem, however, may be with you and not with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are proper, normal, and healthy, you will enjoy the cherishing atmosphere of the Lord s presence in the church and in this atmosphere receive the nourishing supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord for the way He cares for the church!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church people have the privilege of enjoying the Lord in such a fine, tender, intimate, real way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>CHRIST S INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As Eve was Adam s wife, so the church is Christ s Bride John 3:29; Rev 19:7; 21:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, Eve was Adam s increase, and the church is Christ s increase John 3:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When John the Baptist was told of the many who were coming to Christ, John said, He who has the bride is the bridegroom John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then he went on to say, He must increase, but I must decrease v. 30 . The increase in verse 30 is the Bride in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the Lord to increase means that He must have the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the following must go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who believe in Him should follow Him to be His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although John spoke a clear word regarding this, he was not willing to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was the reason that God allowed him to be imprisoned and later beheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, John the Baptist received nothing, and all the increase, the Bride, went to the Bridegroom to be His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just as Eve was Adam s increase, so the church as the Bride of Christ is Christ s increase.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE MARRIED LIFE AND THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are impressed with the various aspects of the mysterious type of Christ and the church unveiled in this chapter of Ephesians, we shall have not only a proper church life, but also a proper married life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wives will know what their responsibility is, and the husbands will know their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul s burden here was to cover both married life and the church life at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his writing he did not separate married life from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, he blended the two together, for he knew that married life is actually part of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Without the married life being proper, it is difficult to have a proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We thank the Lord that through the proper church life our married life also can become proper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a mysterious type of Christ and the church.</S>
