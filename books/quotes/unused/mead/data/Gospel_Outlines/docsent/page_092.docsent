   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Ninety-one THE LOVING FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RECEIVES THE PRODIGAL SON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The First Contrast in Luke Scripture: Luke 15:11-24 Man being from God This parable likens the relationship between man and God to that of a son and his father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that as a son is from his father, so man is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although man did not receive God s life, man s life today comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, from the aspect of creation, man is God s son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man departing and going far away from God One day the younger of two sons took his portion of his father s substance, left his father, and went to a far country.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a picture showing that man goes far away from God even after he has received all his natural ability from God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man living in sin In a country far away from his father, this younger son wasted all his substance with riotous living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result he became poor and had to make a living by feeding swine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that when man leaves God, he begins to live a sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wasting all that he has, he falls into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Feeding the swine symbolizes living the sinful life because swine are dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Describe how man lives a life of feeding the swine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you go to the movie theaters or when you go dancing, you are going to the swine pens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man waking up While he was in his poverty the son woke up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came to himself and began to remember the goodness of his father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows that a man in sin, who is living in sins, remembers God and His blessing when he comes to his end. Describe how poverty helps man to wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is hard for some to wake up until they have sinned to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they have reached the end of dancing or gambling, then they wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man turning to God When the younger son came to himself and remembered his father, he decided to return to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that when a man wakes up from sin, it is natural for him to remember God and turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man wanting to work for God When the son was about to return, he remembered his sins and felt that he was no more worthy to be his father s son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was willing to be a servant instead, and was going to ask his father to hire him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So he prepared four sentences for meeting his father: first, I have sinned against heaven ; second, I have sinned... in thy sight ; third, I am no more worthy to be called thy son ; and fourth, Make me as one of thy hired servants.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows that when a sinner wakes up and turns to God, it is natural for him to feel that he has sinned against God and is unworthy of God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, he feels unworthy of receiving anything from God freely.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this, he depends upon trading his work and good behavior for God s goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He thus hopes to improve himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the wrong concept of every repenting sinner, to think he should be a servant instead of a son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this concept, man always tries to establish his own merit in order to exchange it for God s goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man not realizing the heart of God Although the younger son had a humble heart in feeling unworthy to be a son and in wanting to be a servant, he did not realize the heart of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his father s heart was the longing for his son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many sinners may have such a humble heart, but they do not realize the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s heart is not that repenting sinners would work for Him, but that they would be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While a hired servant must earn what he gets and must work for what he receives, a son receives everything from his father freely.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God receiving man As the younger son was returning to his father, it was far from his realization that his father would be waiting to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was expecting that he would have to knock many times, and that his father would eventually send someone else to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet even while the son was returning and was still afar off, his father saw him coming and ran out to meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While the son thought it was a matter of his returning to his father, even the more it was a matter of his father s waiting to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This tells us that many think that they must pray to God for a long period before He will answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have no realization that God has been there waiting to receive repenting sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But actually, even while such a one is repenting and turning to God, God is waiting to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he saw the son, the father was moved with compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because his heart was moved, it caused him to run and fall on his son s neck, and to kiss him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This running shortened the time and the distance between them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Running involves the feet; falling on the son s neck involves the hands; kissing involves the mouth, which is able to express emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So we can see that the father s whole being was moved for his son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This signifies that when God in heaven sees a sinner repenting, He is moved with compassion, and runs to meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With His whole heart He embraces the repenting sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before repenting, many think that God is terrible and fearful, but after repenting they discover that God is so dear and so near.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God justifying man After the father kissed him, the son immediately began his prepared speech.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when he had just finished his first three sentences, the father interrupted him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The son had just said, I am no more worthy to be called thy son, but the father said to the servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The heart of the father could not stand the son saying that he was unworthy to be called his son.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So he commanded his servants to bring forth the best robe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word the is an important word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The best robe was the robe that had been prepared a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the father spoke, the servants knew which one it was.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The father only had to say the best robe, and the servants understood right away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The father also put a ring on the son s hand and shoes on his feet and killed the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of these were beyond the son s expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Just as the son did, we prepare a speech, but God brings forth the best robe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word BUT should be stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is a big word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This but makes us saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A brother once had a big sign, BUT, hanging on his living room wall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should be condemned, but God justified us; we should be going to hell, but we go to the heavens instead.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God prepared the best robe and put it on us, so that we could match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Putting on the robe signifies Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When a sinner puts on Christ, he matches God and is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The father also put shoes on the son.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Shoes separate man from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When a man returns to God and is justified and sealed by the Holy Spirit, he is able to be separated from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After putting the shoes on his feet, the father killed the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Killing the fatted calf signifies Christ prepared for us as our life and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only when Christ comes into us can we be filled and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God and man making merry together It was at this time that the father and the son ate and drank and were happy together.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before the son came back, the father had no joy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>While the son was away from home, wandering and suffering, the father was also suffering at home.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This shows that when sinners are away from God, wandering and suffering, God is unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only when sinners are at home with God, eating and making merry, is God joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Result The younger son who had been lost was found; he had been dead, and was alive again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This means that a sinner away from God is both lost and dead; but when he returns to God, he is received and justified by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In other words, he is found and he is alive.</S>
