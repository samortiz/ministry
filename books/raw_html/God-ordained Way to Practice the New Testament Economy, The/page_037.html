	 <h2 class="head1">BEING ABSOLUTE FOR SUCH A LIVING<br />
FOR OUR WHOLE LIFE</h2>
<p>We must live to God for the spreading of His kingdom by visiting people and setting up home meetings, and we must be absolute for such a living for our whole life. We should take such a living as the purpose of life, whether we are job-dropping full-timers or money-making full-timers (Luke 9:59-60). We simply should have a job which can sustain us, provide a proper living for our family, and provide for a good upbringing and education for our children. Then we must use the rest of our ability, time, and resources for going out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors to baptize them into the Triune God and to set up home meetings to build up the churches. Every day, every week, every month, and every year throughout our whole life, we must go out to baptize people and set up home meetings. This should become our favorite pastime and even our &ldquo;addiction.&rdquo; To be able to say at the Lord&rsquo;s return that thousands of people have been baptized into the Triune God through us and that many churches have been raised up through our home meetings will be a glory to us at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. But if the Lord comes back and we are empty-handed, we will be troubled at His coming back.</p>
<p>Some may say that to do well at their job or to do well in school requires them to compete and that this competition can fully occupy their time. However, no occupation, regardless of the competition, is to such a high standard that it does not leave us any leisure time. If we have a proper heart, there is still enough time for us to live a life for the spreading of the kingdom. If in one week we do not baptize one person, at least after two weeks we can get one baptized. To go out once or twice a week for two hours is adequate to baptize one person and take care of the baptized ones by setting up meetings in their homes. These new ones will grow, and they will learn from us and repeat what we do. To go out in this way is for the spreading of the kingdom of God. The way of Christianity is to send their young people to the seminary to become professional pastors, the clergy, while all the others sit in their congregations doing nothing. This way will delay the Lord, but the new way will speed up the Lord&rsquo;s return. There is no excuse for our not taking the spreading of the kingdom of God as the purpose of our life.</p>
<p>We must be vigilant every day without wasting our time, energy, and money. All of our time, our money, and our energy must be spent for the unique purpose of knocking on people&rsquo;s doors and setting up home meetings. We must also be vigilant in consecration (Rom. 12:1). Many years ago we may have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, but we must remain in that consecration today. We need to be vigilant in prayer (Eph. 6:18) and in dealing with self-seeking, sins, and worldliness (Gal. 5:26a; Heb. 12:1; 1 John 2:15-17). Also, we must be vigilant in being filled, saturated, and empowered by the Spirit (Acts 13:52) every day and every moment. We must be vigilant in bringing people to Christ and building up home meetings. If we have not baptized one person in two weeks, we need to consider why and not let our time pass away. Then if we go out in full desperation, we will see at least one baptized. We must take the spreading of the kingdom of God as our real and unique career.</p>
<p>If we are vigilant in consecration, in prayer, in dealing with self-seeking, sins, and worldliness, in being filled, saturated, and empowered by the Spirit, in bringing people to Christ and building up home meetings, and in taking the spreading of the kingdom of God as our real career, we will be ready to meet the Lord at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Matt. 25:19). Every day we should live before the judgment seat of Christ, being fearful that if the Lord comes, we may not be ready to meet Him. It is more than worthwhile for us to rise up and go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors to get them baptized. Then we need to set up home meetings and build them up by teaching the new ones the truth and edifying them with a view to building up the Body of Christ. May the Lord bless us in our divine appointment to bear fruit for the producing of His Body (John 15:16).</p>
