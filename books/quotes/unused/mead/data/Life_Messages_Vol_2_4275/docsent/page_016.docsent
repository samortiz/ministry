   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For two thousand years among the human race, there has been this Word, saving us from confusion, mixture, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without it we would have been deluded and led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have this book, which we can read and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose all these years we had only had the Word in letter, without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We would have been in deadness, even though we might not have been misled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the Word without and the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both are the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever is organic has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a human being, for example, we have a physical body without and a human life within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another example would be a little seed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is an outward shell and an inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may figure that if there is life, the shell is unnecessary; but without the shell the life would be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If, on the other hand, you sow an empty shell into the earth, it will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Word is the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without the Spirit, it is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How wonderful that we have both the Word and the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, the shell and the life are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we open a seed to take out the life, there will be nothing there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Similarly, if we cut someone open to find his life, the life will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the Spirit, the Word is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the Word, the Spirit is abstract and intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must have both.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FINDING GOD IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we come to the Word, we are not coming to the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must have the deep realization that we are coming to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must pray, "Lord, You are here in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are in Your Word, and You are the Word as well as the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, He is in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yes, He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These statements are true, but they are not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Solidly speaking, God is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Word are also life, love, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To receive God, Christ, the Spirit, life, light, and love, we must come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must not turn aside from the Word and pray for something to fall upon us from the heavens; this is not the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The biblical way is to take the Word into you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then you will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Word is the embodiment of the Triune God, of Christ, of the Spirit, and of all the divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE WRONG WAY TO USE THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christians have the Bible, but many use it only when they go to their weekly "worship service."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The rest of the time it sits on the shelf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are other Christians who use the Bible like a science textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They think they need to know Greek to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They research words like logos and theos and try to figure out the real meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If only they had a theological education, it would be such a help!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the result of this mental approach?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"The letter killeth" 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the wrong way to touch the Word.</S>
