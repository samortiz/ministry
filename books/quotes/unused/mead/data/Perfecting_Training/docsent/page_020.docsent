   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NUMB TO THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Unless we see this vision we will become numb to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have seen many who became numb to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They still love the church; they still attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But year after year you cannot see the addition of Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather you have to lament that the territory of Christ in their life has been reduced and reduced and reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But they have become numb so that they do not condemn their lack of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Meeting after meeting and message after message they are numb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With them there is no sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the young people first come into the church life they are so sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just one message helps them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But with many of us message after message is taken in but no help is received.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Something hidden is there which frustrates the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>RESTRICTING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although some of you have been among us for eight or nine years, you have not gotten much growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has not been increasing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His territory within you has not been enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather it has been restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is simply because of your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nearly all of the ground of your being is occupied by this hidden thing, peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of your Christian life or of your church life you had a lot of improvement and a lot of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You gave Christ more and more place, but after a certain time the territory of Christ in your Christian life stopped being enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now it is restricted all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to consider this as a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to ask the Lord for His mercy to be rescued from this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We simply cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only thing we can do is to realize we have such a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you can realize that you have such a problem, you are very close to the border of being rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The realization that comes from such a vision nearly becomes your rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then you will begin to have no confidence in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will realize that some hidden problem is concealed in your being, your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we have such a realization of this problem, we will become fearful and trembling in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will be a great rescue to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peculiarity is very deep within our being and occupies us subtly from experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may consider this person is peculiar or that person is peculiar, but, in fact, we all have peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all sick of the disease of peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peculiarity is a very subtle thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you consider that a certain person is peculiar, it must be that his peculiarity is not so subtle because it is very apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because it is on the surface everyone is clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But your peculiarity may be very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It may be deeply hidden within you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only do others fail to see it, even you yourself cannot discern your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You do not realize that you have a serious and terrible peculiarity because it is so hidden within you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE SUBTLETY OF PECULIARITY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not one person has no peculiarity!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every fallen descendant of Adam is a peculiar person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as we are descendants of the fallen Adam, we are peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it is difficult for you to discover my peculiarity, it simply proves my peculiarity is more subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is hidden in the many good aspects of my character and being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of hidden peculiarity is the strongest controller and director of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever you do is controlled by this hidden peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even your spirituality is under its direction.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is even the reason people can see your spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>People cannot see your hidden peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your spirituality is like a kite and your peculiarity is like a hidden person holding the kite string.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your spirituality is under the control of such a subtle, hidden thing your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Years ago, from about 1932, I began to realize that within the seeking Christians there was a kind of hidden peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time I didn t see so much the hidden peculiarity but I saw the apparent peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I only saw that certain people were quite peculiar because their peculiarity was on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I did not realize that actually everyone is peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After many years of experience and observation, I realize that not one person is not peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have met many very spiritual people and with every one of them there was a kind of peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This bothered me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before I met them I heard about them and I read their books.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I got much help from them and I respected them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From reading their books I had a very high imagination concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But after I met them and stayed with them, I became disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I cannot say that they were bad; they were all good.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But the disappointing thing was that all of them had a kind of peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I was disappointed when I discovered these spiritual persons did not match my dream concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then I began to consider myself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I realized my peculiarity might be stronger than theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now I really sympathize with others because I realize that we all have peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No two faces are exactly the same, and no two peculiarities are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every man s peculiarity is different.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>People s faces may be somewhat easy to describe: some are round; others are long; others may be square.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But people s peculiarity is very difficult to name and to denominate.</S>
