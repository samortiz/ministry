   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRESPASS OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH RESPECT TO OFFENSES TOWARD MEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have already said that the trespass offering consists of two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One part concerns an offense toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is covered in Leviticus 5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The other part concerns an offense toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is covered in Leviticus 6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I want to speak on what to do when we have offended man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the subject of chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today's topic can be called, "What we must do if we have lost our fellowship with God due to our offense against others."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must remember that chapter six is not on salvation and receiving life, but on our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SOME SINS AGAINST MAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 1 says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This tells us that what follows is from God and not from Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us see which sins, according to God, are against man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems as if God has put together a list which shows various kinds of trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the bottom of the list, a total of all these trespasses is given.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 2 says, "When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah..."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the following trespasses are all against man, why does it say that they are against the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a person sins against a man, he also sins against God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is the Creator, and every human being is created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, offending man is the same as offending God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now consider some of the trespasses against man:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unfaithful to What Was Entrusted</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 2 says, "Lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This sin will cause us to lose our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brothers, has anyone delivered something to us to keep?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once when I went home to Foochow, someone asked me to bring some mangoes to my second aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But mangoes rot easily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although I tried to prevent them from rotting, some still changed color and had almost become rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I thought that since all of them might be rotten by the time I arrived home, why not give them away to the people on the boat?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So I selected three of the greenest ones, kept them, and gave the rest away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As I came closer to home, my heart felt a little uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was being unfaithful in the thing delivered to me by my neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The mangoes were not mine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of being good or rotten, I had to bring them to my second aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I felt a little ashamed explaining this to my aunt, but I could not let it go unexplained because that would be unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, I cleared the matter up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If someone entrusts fifty dollars to us, we may be faithful to it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if someone entrusts fifty cents to us, we may not be truthful about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the amount is small, we may think that it is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this is deceitful; it is a sin which will cause us to lose our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps someone entrusts a letter to us to deliver.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if we do not open the letter and read it, we sometimes like to look at the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is all right if we unintentionally glance at it; but if we have the intention to pry into others' secrets, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This matter will hinder our real and intimate fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am afraid that the reason many people cannot read the Bible well is that they have sins which are not properly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are careless and do not deal with such sins, we will not be able to fellowship with God freely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lying in Business</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 2 says, "Lies to his fellowman in regard to...a security."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The previous case is general.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This case is not general; it is very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to sin in business.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, this is not directed only at those who are in business, but to every brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not only can businessmen commit this sin, every brother and sister can commit this sin as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I heard that once a mother with her three sons was sitting on a bus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the bus conductor came to collect the fares, the mother told one of her sons to give the conductor seventy cents.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Four tickets should cost seventy-two cents, but she paid only seventy cents.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She kept back two cents.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This was not dishonesty on the part of the conductor, but dishonesty on the part of the one who purchased the tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes a person rides on a tram and passes three stations beyond his destination.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Should he pay according to his original destination, or according to the station that he finally gets off at?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He may think that it is better for him to profit than for the tram conductor to profit, and he may decide not to pay for the three stations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The tram conductor may cheat, but how can a Christian cheat?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a Christian, he cannot allow these things to carelessly occur.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes when we buy things, others may give us twenty cents more for change.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not return it, we are not honest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we covet the extra twenty cents, we are delighting in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These are very small matters, but we should not let them pass lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some brothers say that without lying, one cannot be successful in business.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But I tell you that we must conduct our business in honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We may suffer in the beginning, but eventually we will come out on top.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what many brothers have told me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not have to lie, and we must not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we lie intentionally in our business, we will lose our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must deal with this.</S>
