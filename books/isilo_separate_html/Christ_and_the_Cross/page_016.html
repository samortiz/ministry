<p>When Saul of Tarsus was going to Damascus to persecute the believers, he met the Lord. The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). This word puzzled and surprised Saul because he thought that he was persecuting people who believed in Jesus, such as Stephen, Peter, John, and James, people whom he could see and touch. But here was Someone, whom Saul had neither seen nor known, questioning him from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; Hence, Saul was puzzled and asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (v. 5). This response was an even greater surprise; it was beyond Saul&rsquo;s imagination. He had persecuted Stephen and the church, but when had he persecuted Jesus? Nevertheless, the Lord said that He was being persecuted by Saul. The Lord said this because He and His believers are one; He and the church are one. He is in the church, and the church is in Him. He is the church, and the church is Him. To persecute the church is to persecute the Lord, and to persecute His believers is to persecute Him. Hence, the Lord said to Saul, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; He wanted Saul to know that by persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting &ldquo;Me&rdquo; and that when Saul persecuted the church, the Lord&rsquo;s believers, he was persecuting &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; The word <em>Me</em> refers to a great, universal &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; This &ldquo;Me&rdquo; includes the Lord Jesus and all His believers in the universe. This great, universal &ldquo;Me&rdquo; is the universal man, the mysterious Christ, the corporate Christ, who includes Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Lord showed Saul that He and the church are one, because the Lord wanted Paul to reveal the mystery of His oneness with the church. When Saul was called, the Lord revealed that the church is Christ and that to persecute the church, His believers, was to persecute Him, that is, to persecute Christ. From the day he was called, Paul was deeply impressed with the church&rsquo;s oneness with the Lord. This impression became the basis of his revelation concerning the mystery of the church. From that day Paul knew the Lord and saw that the church was one with Christ, that the church was Christ. Hence, to persecute the church was to persecute Christ and to touch the church was to touch Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SEQUEL TO CHRIST&rsquo;S BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>The Lord said to Saul, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; This word reveals that Christ and the church are one Body. It also shows that even though Acts reveals the move of the apostles and the church, it is really a sequel to the biography of Christ. We often say that the four Gospels are biographies of Christ. However, if we would see the significance of the word <em>Me,</em> that is, that the church and Christ are one entity, we would acknowledge that Acts is also Christ&rsquo;s biography. The four Gospels are a record of Christ&rsquo;s words and deeds on the earth, and Acts is also a record of Christ&rsquo;s words and deeds on the earth. The only difference is that the four Gospels are a record of the words and deeds of the individual Christ, but Acts is a record of the words and deeds of the corporate Christ, Christ in the apostles and the church. Although the outward instrument&mdash;the man Jesus Christ or the apostles and the church&mdash;may be different, the person speaking and acting is the same. The man Jesus Christ who spoke and did things in the four Gospels entered into Peter, John, and numerous other believers in order to speak and do things in them as the church, as recorded in Acts. Therefore, the four Gospels and the book of Acts are His biographies. The words and deeds of Jesus Christ did not end in the four Gospels; they were continued in Acts. Hence, Acts is the continuation of the four Gospels, a sequel to the Lord&rsquo;s biography. In Acts the Lord continues to move through the apostles and the church and in the apostles and the church.</p>
<p>In Acts the apostles and the church continued and extended the Christ in the Gospels. When we see Peter, John, Stephen, Paul, Silas, and many other believers in Acts, we feel as if we have met Christ. While Stephen was being martyred, he asked for the forgiveness of those who stoned him, in the same way that Christ had asked for the forgiveness of those who crucified Him (7:59-60; Luke 23:34). In Acts Christ was living again in Peter, John, Paul, and many other believers. Hence, when we read concerning the acts of the apostles and the church, we are reading a record of Christ. When we see the acts of the apostles and the church, we see the acts of Christ, and when we see the church, we see Christ, because Christ is moving in His believers, and He is the life and content of the church. The church is the Body of Christ, His continuation, and His extension because the church is one with Christ.</p>
<p>The believers in Acts were a continuation of Christ, they were His extension, and they belonged to the Lord, loved Him, lived Him, and died for Him. Furthermore, the martyrs who have lived throughout church history were also an extension and continuation of Christ. When we read biographies of the martyrs, we sense that they were filled with Christ. We sense Christ in the holy life that they lived and in the martyrdom that they suffered. Throughout the generations those who have stood on the Lord&rsquo;s side, maintained His testimony, and lived in Him have been His continuation. They were filled with Christ, because for them to live was Christ (Phil. 1:21). In whatever age they lived, they were Christ, and wherever they were, Christ was seen. Hence, the church is the place where Christ is on the earth.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
