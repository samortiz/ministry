<p>Once we have been touched by the Lord&rsquo;s love and have consecrated ourselves to Him, the Lord&rsquo;s life, which is the Lord Himself, immediately gains the ground to operate in us, to gradually work everything of the Lord into us. Once we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s life gains the ground to develop and grow in us and to remove every unrighteous, unholy, or improper thing in us so that we may be transformed until we are fully like Him.</p>
<p>Our consecration allows the Lord to work in us. The Lord is waiting for us to give Him the ground. Once we willingly hand ourselves over and consent to let Him work in us, His life will operate in us and give us a sense that we must separate ourselves from this thing or put away another thing. The Lord will give us a sense related to everything that is incompatible with His life or does not please Him. If we are willing to obey this sense, the Lord will remove these things one by one according to the power of His life. This will not come about by outward, doctrinal teaching but by the operation of the might of His life in us. His life is righteous, holy, bright, and divine. When He has the ground, He will remove little by little everything in us that is unrighteous, unholy, dark, or apart from God. From the center of our being, He will spread outward to the circumference of our being step by step. Eventually, with light He will efface everything in us that is dark, and by life He will swallow up everything in us that is dead. In this process we will be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>A genuine and proper consecration gives the Lord&rsquo;s life the ground to operate and spread in us by letting Him work in us. As long as we are faithful and remain in our consecration, giving the Lord the ground to work as He pleases, His life will develop and grow in us unto our maturity and perfection (Heb. 10:1, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Behavioral Change Not Being<br />
the Focus of Consecration</h2>
<p>Since consecration does not emphasize our working for God but rather our letting God work in us, consecration is not focused on outward, behavioral change but on the inner growth of God&rsquo;s life. Our behavior has no standing in God&rsquo;s redemption. Our behavior cannot save us, cause us to receive God&rsquo;s life, or cause us to progress in our growth in God&rsquo;s life. Our salvation and our receiving of God&rsquo;s life do not depend on behavior but on believing. In the same way the growth of God&rsquo;s life in us does not depend on behavior but on consecration. Just as believing, the receiving of God&rsquo;s life, is not the issue of behavioral change, consecration is not related to behavioral change.</p>
<p>Consecration is not for us to live a godly life but for us to let God live out from us. Nothing of our working or doing can be brought into God&rsquo;s redemption. God accomplishes everything in His redemption. In His redemption we receive Him and everything that He has done, and then we let Him work in us as He pleases. Our receiving is through believing, and our letting Him work is through consecrating. Although believing in the Lord affects our behavior positively, a change in behavior is not God&rsquo;s goal. Similarly, although consecrating ourselves to the Lord will affect our behavior, this is not God&rsquo;s goal. Consecration is not focused on a change in our behavior but on allowing God to work in us for the growth of His life in us.</p>
<p>The Lord does not want us to work or to do anything for Him; He only wants us to give Him the ground to work Himself into us and to be formed in us. The Lord wants us to consecrate ourselves to Him, to hand all the authority over to Him, so that He may work in us as He pleases. Then His life will grow in us, and He will be formed in us (Gal. 4:19), manifesting His glorious image in us (2 Cor. 3:18). As a result of this inward growth, our outward actions will not be an issue of our behavior but of His life. Everything in our living will be the Lord living out from us; it will not be something of our doing. Although others may regard our living as being an expression of our virtues, we will sense only that the Lord is living out His life in us, based on our consecration to Him.</p>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is not to change our behavior but to work Himself into us so that we may have His life and express His image. From the beginning to the end of His work in us, God&rsquo;s only desire is that His life would develop and grow in us until He is formed in us. Only our consecration, our handing ourselves over to Him, gives Him the opportunity to work this out. Only our consecration gives God the authority in us. Thus, only our consecration gives Him the ground to cause His life to grow in us unto maturity.</p>
<p>This is the focus of consecration. If our consecration does not provide the ground for God&rsquo;s life to grow in us, then our consecration is improper. Proper consecration gives God the ground to do what He wants to do in us so that His life may grow unto maturity. We must examine our consecration in this light and let God gain such a consecration. This is necessary for God&rsquo;s life to grow within us unto maturity, and it is indispensable for us to enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecration Being Continual</h2>
<p>Although consecration is a step, it is not something that can be done only once. Consecration is merely a gate that we pass through and a way that we take. Once we have passed through the gate of consecration, we must walk on the way of consecration. Passing through the gate is for walking on the way; this is the order ordained in the Bible. We must first pass through the gate and then walk on the way (Matt. 7:14). After we are saved, we must have a definite time of consecrating ourselves to the Lord, of passing through the gate of consecration, before we can enter into the blessed realm of enjoying the salvation that we obtained by believing. In order to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation continually after our initial consecration, we must take the way of consecration by not leaving our consecrated position or losing the reality of our consecration. Whenever we leave our consecrated position and stop living a consecrated life, we will lose the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>We need to continually renew our consecration. Actually, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord every morning. Then at every turning point and every juncture in our life, we need a new consecration. Chapters 28 through 29 in the book of Numbers speak of God&rsquo;s people offering a burnt offering every day, every Sabbath, every month, and at every feast. This typifies our continual consecration to God. Through consecration we enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation and let the Lord&rsquo;s life operate and grow in us. We should never cease to consecrate, much less lose our consecration. We must remain in our consecration to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation continually. This is our indispensable responsibility.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Redemption in God's Plan &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
