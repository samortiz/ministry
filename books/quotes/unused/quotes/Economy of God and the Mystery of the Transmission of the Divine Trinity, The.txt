It has a final warning which says that no one should either add anything or take away anything from the Word of God
The division of the sections of the Bible is of profound significance and even the arrangement of the books of the Bible inspires admiration
If the sequence of the Bible were arranged according to man's natural concept, then the proper significance would be lost
According to the style of Genesis, whenever someone is mentioned, there is usually an account of his background
You may consider yourself to have exerted sufficient effort only after you have worn out several copies of the Bible
The circles, dots, and lines you draw, the colors you apply, and the words you write must all be meaningful, and the more the better
It includes confession of sins prayer dealing with negative things obedience paying the price and following the leading of the Holy Spirit
Without being filled with the Holy Spirit, it is impossible to pursue the growth in life-the growth in life is simply unattainable
In biblical figures, we are God's plants , and the Triune God is our soil , sunlight , air , and water, including rain
The Holy Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God therefore to be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be filled with the Triune God
When we are filled with the Triune God, we have soil, water, sunlight, and air, and the result is that we grow and become full-grown in life
We cannot say that because we were thoroughly filled with the Holy Spirit yesterday, we do not need to be filled today
It is because the result of our pursuit in the preceding three matters depends entirely on the extent of our character training
Character is a common term, but the training of a Christian's character is related to the transformation referred to in the Bible
The real character training of a Christian is accomplished not by outward improvement but by inward transformation
History shows that people who nurture their humanity are strong in their will and able to exercise self-restraint
In the same principle, if we desire to be transformed into precious stones, we also must pass through the same process and procedure
We already have the life of the Lord Jesus in us; however, if we remain intact, there is no way for this life to be mingled with us
God will also raise up the environment as high temperature and intense pressure in order to transform us into precious stones
If a man or a woman is still not married after having passed the right age for marriage, there is great pressure upon them
Someone may be altogether unmanageable, but once he sees his wife, he becomes just like a mouse coming face to face with a cat
If a woman has no child after she has been married three years, she is under a great deal of pressure to have children
Because we love the Lord, God arranges our marriage and our family in such a way so that we can be broken and be transformed
God arranges all things to work together in order to break us, press us, and grind us into powder for our transformation
Because we are constrained by God through the environment, it seems that we have no alternative but to take this way
The more we are willing to suffer, the more joy we will have; the more joy we have, the more we will be transformed
In order to be useful in the service to the Lord, we need to receive a great deal of training in our character
The eternal purpose is the eternal plan that God made in eternity past, and this eternal plan is God's economy
The Bible shows us that God has an economy in Himself, and this economy includes God's eternal purpose, plan, dispensation, and intention
In Greek, the word for economy is not hard to comprehend, but its usage in the New Testament is not so easy to understand
In Luke 16 when the Lord Jesus spoke about the unrighteous steward, He used this word, which in these verses is translated stewardship
In the New Testament Paul is the only one who used this term from the viewpoint of God's New Testament economy
He used it three times-twice in Ephesians and once in 1 Timothy -with direct reference to God's New Testament economy
Although Paul referred to God's New Testament economy in 1 Timothy, it was still in relation to the church in Ephesus
He used it twice in Ephesians speaking directly to the church in Ephesus and once in 1 Timothy speaking in relation to the church in Ephesus
In other words, God's speaking in the New Testament concerning His New Testament economy was altogether directed to the church in Ephesus
The first word oikos means 'house' or 'home,' denoting a household or a dwelling place; the second word nomos means 'law'
When these two words are combined together, it means 'household law,' and it may be explained further to mean 'household administration'
Since the household administration is to enforce the household rules, naturally it has an arrangement with a plan
When there is an arrangement or a plan there is a purpose and this arrangement or plan with a purpose constitutes a household administration
When this word is used in theology to explain theological doctrines, it is usually understood as 'age' or 'period'
According to the record of the Bible, the dispensation of God's economy can be divided into four great periods
In other words, God's dispensation in the first period is concerning the patriarchs, and it can be called the dispensation of the patriarchs
God's dispensation in the second period is concerning His dealing with men by the law, and it can be called the dispensation of the law
God's dispensation in the third period is concerning the application of the grace of Christ, and it can be called the dispensation of grace
Verse 2a goes on to say, 'But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep'
At this time the Spirit of God was moving and brooding upon the surface of the waters to begin His work of re-creation
He created the living creatures on the dry land, which consisted mainly of three categories-cattle, beasts, and creeping things
God's original creation , particularly the creation of the heavens and the earth, was in the age long before Adam
If we count from Adam until the millennial kingdom, it should be a little over, if not exactly, seven thousand years
At the beginning of this one week, the seventh Caesar of the restored Roman Empire will make a firm covenant with Israel
The Lord Jesus said that the day of His coming back was not made known even to Him as the One who was God become man
For this reason, whether this period of mysteries will be two thousand years or more than two thousand years, no one knows
After the passing away of Babylon, a political situation emerged that was of two parts , typified by the silver breasts and arms
After Medo-Persia ended, there were the abdomen and the thighs of bronze, signifying the Macedonian-Grecian Empire founded by Alexander
At that time the Jews were a little indifferent toward him and did not supply him with provisions, so he was angry in his heart
Understanding the words in the book concerning himself, he was exceedingly happy and dealt with the Jews favorably
Later the Roman Empire was divided into two parts, the eastern part and the western part, signified by the two iron legs
History points out that after the passing away of the Roman Empire, democracy began to gain ground in the European countries
Daniel 2 also mentions four kinds of metals: gold, silver, bronze, and iron, representing four kinds of authority and glory
During the Babylonian age, the age of gold, the monarchs were not only dictatorial but also honored by the people
Up to this day, countries such as Great Britain, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Japan still maintain this kind of political system
For this reason, it is hard, even impossible, to count how long this period of partly iron and partly clay will last
Clay signifies democracy and the rights of the people, because man was created by God with the dust of the earth
From this we see that it is best to translate this word into economy, the anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia
When we describe someone who is full of plans, intentions, and arrangements, we say that such a one is 'filled with ching lun'
Such a rendering does not clearly express the original meaning of the word and makes it hard for people to understand
After a thorough study of human history, culture, and language with its usage, Webster's Dictionary was compiled
There is an administration in every age or period, and the age itself can be referred to by the administration in that age
We have already seen what God's economy is, and we have also seen the dispensations of God in His economy in four ages
We must see that the New Jerusalem has its initial coming and that it also has its consummate coming, its full coming
The initial coming of the New Jerusalem will be in the millennial kingdom for one thousand years on a small scale
Although the majority of the saints are God's chosen and saved ones, they have not allowed the grace of God to work in them thoroughly
The New Jerusalem is an entity constituted with the chosen and matured people of God who have reached the maturity in life
Its scale is still quite small in the millennial kingdom because it will be constituted only with the overcomers
The saints, including those in the Old Testament, who died without being matured are typified by the five foolish virgins
The coming of the New Jerusalem has two stages: the initial stage as a miniature and the completing stage as the consummation
The initial coming is in the millennial kingdom, and the complete and full coming is in the new heaven and new earth
In His economy God intends, arranges, and plans to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, called, redeemed, and regenerated people
God's economy is God's intention, plan, and arrangement, which is also His purpose and His heart's pleasure and delight
Gods hearts desire and purpose is nothing other than to dispense Himself into His chosen created called redeemed and regenerated people
It is by the Divine Trinity that God is able to dispense Himself into all His chosen, created, called, redeemed, and regenerated people
There is a good portrait of this in the Old Testament: the totality of three generations of men-Abraham, Issac, and Jacob
The revelation in Ephesians concerning the Body of Christ and the members of Christ is very complete and thorough
We must contact Him daily and exercise our spirit constantly to contact Him, commune with Him, and fellowship with Him as the Spirit
In this way all the divine riches of the Divine Trinity will be continually transfused into us to constitute us into the Body of Christ
Everyone who reads the Bible has a fourfold problem-natural concepts, human concepts, religious concepts, and ethical concepts
Unless we remove every one of these four layers of veils, it will be difficult for us to see the four divine matters revealed in the Bible
Perhaps some will ask, 'If we reject our moral, religious, human, and natural concepts, won't we be abnormal'?
According to the statutes of the law, since he was born into a priestly family and his father was a priest, he was a priest by birth
He left the people to live alone, not in the holy temple, nor in the holy city, nor in his priestly home, but in the wilderness
He lived and worked in the wilderness; all his living and all his activities were carried out in the wilderness
In any case, after reading the record of John's living, people always have the impression that John had a wild flavor
Since John was born a priest, he should have worn the priestly garment and should have ministered in the temple
In Matthew 312 we are told that he appeared preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying Repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
He did not act at all like a refined preacher, for when he saw the religionists, he rebuked them, calling them 'offspring of vipers'
He behaved in this way to show that he came with the intention to stand against culture, religion, naturalness, tradition, and morality
John answered, 'He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise'
What he meant was that everyone had to be prepared because the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God, was drawing near
In the same principle, the kingdom of God is God Himself, and it is God Himself who becomes everything as the content of the kingdom of God
If we desire to serve the Lord and walk on His way for our whole life we must have a pure knowledge of the Word according to Gods revelation
The Lord Jesus answered, 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
Unless you are born of water and the Spirit, you cannot have a share in God's world; that is, you cannot participate in God's kingdom'
Today we all are descendants of Adam born in the human world; we entered the human kingdom by being born of our parents
Regardless of how much the monkey has been taught and how much the monkey is able to mimic human behavior, the monkey is still a monkey
Once the performance was over, the monkey immediately climbed down from the table, exposing its real condition
Today all religions, including Christianity, are just like trainers teaching monkeys to enter into the human kingdom
A monkey having only the monkey life can enter only into the monkey kingdom; a monkey cannot enter into the human kingdom through education
When the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus Unless one is born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God He seemed to be saying Nicodemus you are wrong
You have to change your concepts about Moses, your concepts about the law, and even your worldly, natural concepts about serving God
In actuality, this word may be translated as 'have a change of concept,' which means to have a change in our thinking and in our philosophy
It said, Do not murder, do not lie, do not steal, do not bear false testimony, honor your parents, and earnestly care for others
Moses' teachings, however, could only cause people to be lawful in the human kingdom; they could not bring them into the kingdom of God
From the very beginning he told people to have a change of concept because Gods world Gods kingdom had drawn near and was right at the door
Following John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus also said, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near' when He went out to minister
If the kingdom of God is merely God's reigning and the realm of God's reigning, then this means that it is God controlling man
If this happened, then to try to make the monkey to live and walk like a monkey again would be a suffering to the monkey
Similarly if we want to understand that God is triune we need to be familiar with Luke 15 which gives the best illustration of this matter
In this version, three lines were drawn next to the word God to indicate that the word is plural in number, referring to the Triune God
Before the creation of man, the Triune God, whom we also call the Divine Trinity, held a council of the Divine Trinity
The Bible does not say that while the Father was creating, the Son was standing and watching, and the Spirit was not doing anything
According to our study of the Ten Commandments, we can summarize them in four words: love, light, holiness, and righteousness
According to His attributes of love light holiness and righteousness God created man with a conscience of morality and a concept of morality
The faculties of our mind, emotion, and will, which constitute what we are, were created according to God's intrinsic being
Human beings delight in love, light, holiness, and righteousness because we were created in this way according to God's attributes
The way that man would be created was determined through the council of the Divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
All that the Father has is in the Son, all that the Son has is given to the Spirit, and all that the Spirit has is realized in us
The fourth portion is Matthew 28:19: 'Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, which constitute this one God
To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father'
At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned, and from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers
Of all the outlines in the New Testament Recovery Version, the outline of the Gospel of John may be considered the best
The first main section, chapters one through thirteen, concerns 'The eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man'
In order to produce such a habitation, it is necessary that the Spirit come to abide and live in the believers
Within the two main sections there are sub-points, and each sub-point has many small items that give further explanation
The first small item is The Word in eternity past who was God through creation coming as life and light to bring forth the children of God
Before we present the main points of this section, however, we must firstly have a general knowledge about its position in the book
The first small section, which comprises all of chapter fourteen, is on 'The dispensing of the Triune God-for the producing of His abode'
In 147 the Lord told the disciples If you had known Me you would have known My Father also and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him
What the Lord meant when He said this to the disciples was that the disciples had seen the Father since they had already seen the Son
Philip, however, felt that although they had been seeing the Lord for such a long time, they had not yet seen the Father
Today nearly all of Christianity is a Philip: the Catholic Church is a Philip, and the Protestant churches are also Philips
The so-called fundamentalists are Philips, the Pentecostalists are Philips, and, even more, the modernists are Philips
Whoever preaches the word without knowing the mystery of the Divine Trinity is speaking nonsense and is therefore a Philip
Today nearly all of the preaching by Christianity is totally off-track and is far away from the central subject-the Divine Trinity
Anyone who does not base his speaking upon the revelation of the Divine Trinity speaks nonsense and is a Philip
Bible teachers all know that the New Testament contains the four Gospels, which speak about four aspects of the Lord Jesus
In Chinese, some words are very close in pronunciation, and such words must be pronounced very carefully to avoid being misunderstood
In actuality, the mystery in the four Gospels is the same as the mystery in the Gospel of John, and the mystery in John is the Triune God
Some people argue that the life-giving Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit of Christ as a person
Since 1 Corinthians 15:45b says explicitly that He became a 'life-giving' Spirit, then it simply means that He became a life-giving Spirit
That the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit is a very crucial revelation, and we cannot delete the word life-giving as it pleases us
The second crucial verse concerning Christ being the Spirit is 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
The Lord' here, of course, is Jesus, and 'the Spirit' is the Spirit who gives life, mentioned in verse 6, and who is the life-giving Spirit
In the compilation of the hymnal, we did our best to collect all the truths expressed in hymns from different Christian backgrounds
Without this truth, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, the Spirit is the Spirit and the three are totally separated
In other words, without Christ being the Spirit, the three of the Divine Trinity would be completely separated
If this was Philip's thought concerning what it meant to know Jesus, then this shows that he did not know Jesus at all
The Lord went on to say, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father'?
Shuang-huang is a Chinese variety act featuring two performers, one of whom speaks while the other acts out the gestures-Trans
At the same time, the One who speaks without is in the One who works within; that is, the Son is in the Father
Though They are one, there is still the aspect of Their being two; furthermore, though there is the aspect of Their being two, They are one
In the same way, when you work for the Lord, you need to learn to speak for the Lord so that you can dispense Him into others
We need the training of infusing: we need to be infused with God's economy, and the more we are infused the better
John 14, 15, and 16 are all on the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and this dispensing depends on speaking
Similarly, our doing 'greater works' refers to our speaking through which the Lord who abides in us does His work
According to the context of John 14:11-12, 'greater' does not refer to greater signs or wonders but to the speaking which is for dispensing
The Gospel of John shows us the Word from its outset: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God'
We should not merely know the Bible on the surface, but we should go deeper to know the mysterious truth in the Bible
Only this truth can constitute us into another kind of person, enabling us to speak for God and to dispense God into others
On the surface John 14:16-20, 23, and 26 seem to be easy to understand, but actually these verses contain a very critical truth
In John 14:10 the Lord said, 'I am in the Father and the Father is in Me,' indicating that He and the Father coinhere
Since the two-the Son and the Father-were already mingled as one, how could the Son ask the Father a question?
Since there would be another Comforter, this means that the Lord Himself, who was with the disciples at that time, was the first Comforter
The world beholds Him no longer, but we behold Him, because He lives with us; not only so, He lives in us, and we live in Him
He stayed in the tomb for a little over twenty-four hours and was resurrected early in the morning of the third day
According to the calendar of the Jews, a day began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until six o'clock in the evening of the next day
On the third day, that is, in the early morning of the Lord's Day when it was still dark, He had already resurrected
Then on the third day, the Lord's Day, when it was still dark, He was resurrected, and in the same evening He came
On the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples and breathed into them the promised Spirit, His very reality
In that day refers to the day of the Lord's resurrection, and to know is to apprehend, experience, and appreciate
When the Lord was speaking to the disciples, they did not know that they would be in Him because He had not yet dispensed Himself into them
At the end of John 14:17 the Lord said that the Spirit of reality would come to abide with the disciples and be in the disciples
We can only say that we know that these verses tell us about the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but what we know, we still do not know
At the same time, because the Son is in the Father, the result is that the Father as well as the Son respond to your love by loving you
At this moment the teller does not care whether you are Brother Lin or Brother Wang but only cares for that 'name'-Brother Chang
You just need to give Brother Chang's seal and passbook to the teller, then you can withdraw money in Brother Chang's name
Similarly, the Father's sending the Spirit in the Son's name means that the Father and the Son are one; the two are inseparable
John 14:26 clearly says that the Father will send the Spirit, yet 15:26 says that the Son will send the Comforter from the Father
The Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son from the Father, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father
When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father and also with the Son; therefore, the One who comes is the Triune God
In particular, the portion in John 14 concerning the truth of the mystery of the Divine Trinity is not easy to explain
Of course, we can be like the Lord's disciples and eat raw ears of wheat from the grainfields , but that is not the proper way of eating
Originally it was wheat, but in order to become our food, it has to be ground into flour and then made into bread or noodles
What has happened is that after being processed the wheat has become flour and has been made into noodles for the purpose of getting into us
The above illustration helps us to see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God-the Triune God-to be our food
John 6 tells us about a little boy who had five barley loaves and who came to the place where Jesus and a great crowd gathered
He is the wheat, and He is also the bread, for the wheat has to be ground into flour before it can be made into bread
They do not understand that the real spiritual significance of bread-breaking is that Jesus as the embodiment of God is the bread
He was a grain of wheat which went through a process to become flour and a further process to be made into bread for us to eat
The One in whom we believe is the processed Triune God, and the One of whom we eat is the processed grain of wheat
Please bear in mind that God's economy, God's dispensing, God's union with us, and God's corporate expression are all included in this truth
Our partaking of the bread indicates that we participate in Christ, and as a result, we are all made one, to be His one Body
Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, the fullness of God, and we all are the expression of the fullness of the Triune God
He went through a process not only with the divine and human elements, but He also had many other elements added to Him
He is not merely the Savior who gives us eternal life and the hope of eternal life, but He is also the processed Triune God
Previously, His death, His burial, His resurrection, and His ascension were merely His own and had nothing to do with us
Before He became the Spirit, He was He, and we were we, but after He entered into us as the Spirit, He and we have become one
These eight verses speak of the Triune God who passed through all the processes and enters into us to be one with us
The emphasis of traditional Christianity in expounding these few verses is that the Holy Spirit comes to teach us the truth
In actuality, what the Lord said in John 16:12-15 is not a matter of understanding doctrines but a matter of entering into reality
He was not concerned about the disciples' being able to understand doctrines or truths, but about their being guided into all the reality
Now the Spirit of reality receives all these riches from the Son and then transfers, transmits, and even transfuses them into the disciples
2 Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
When we are filled with the Spirit, what actually happens is that we have the Spirit conducted and transmitted into our spirit
We have pointed out that among the three of the Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-the Father as the source has all the riches
The only way we can have wrath and yet not lose our temper is to actively enjoy God and thereby receive His transmission
Stanza 2 says that the Father as the source is rich, that His wealth is inexhaustible, and that He is indeed a treasure-store
John 3:35 says, 'The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand,' and in 16:15 the Lord said, 'All that the Father has is Mine'
The word given in 3:35 and 13:3 actually means 'transmitted,' indicating that the Father's riches have all been transmitted to the Son
Paul told us in his Epistles that Christ the Son is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily
The third step is that all that the Son has and all that He has obtained have all been transmitted to the Spirit
Often when we want to pray, we lack the energy because we do not have the Spirit as the motivating power in us
At such a time we need the transmission of the Spirit; we need the Spirit to be transmitted into our spirit and to fill us
Sometimes you feel that you are full of the Holy Spirit and full of life, and other times you feel that you are heavenly and uplifted
The reason we are so complicated is that we are earthly people by nature, but we also have the Spirit within us
If there is not enough transmission of the Spirit within us, then we are far away from the heavens and close to the earth
Consequently, we become people who are of the Spirit, who are of the Lord, who are of God, and who are of the heavens
Once the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are dispensed into us, They are mingled with us and become one with us
In the entire Bible, Ephesians is the only book in which every chapter is structured with the Divine Trinity as its basic element
Ephesians 1 reveals that the Father selected and predestinated us before the foundation of the world according to His plan
In other words the accomplishment of Gods redemption and salvation depends entirely on the Divine Trinitythe Father the Son and the Spirit
It is through the Son, who, by accomplishing redemption, became the means by which we have access unto the Father
As a result we, the created, fallen, and redeemed human beings, have been brought together with the Triune God
The central thought is that the Triune God has wrought Himself into us through His selection predestination redemption sealing and pledging
Chapter two says that through the Son and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father, that is, we enter into the Father
Chapter one reveals that God has come into us, while chapter two tells us that we have entered into the Father
We have the economy of God, the dispensing of God, and the union of God with us, resulting in the producing of the Body, the church
Since we were redeemed and have the Triune God in us, through the Son we have access in the Spirit unto the Father
There is nothing special in simply kneeling down, but to bow our knees, however, is to kneel down in a solemn way
Paul's prayer is related to the dispensing and mingling of the Triune God for the purpose of obtaining a corporate expression of Himself
In His thirty years of human living and three and a half years of ministry, the Lord gave many profound and excellent messages
Following this, in chapter thirteen before Judas went out, the Lord pointed out that Judas was going to betray Him, and gave him a morsel
The Lord's intention was to send Judas to betray Him; for the Lord also said to him, 'What you do, do quickly'
Immediately after that, the Lord said, 'Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him
What the Lord meant was that Judas would go to betray Him and that He was very happy, because as a result He would be glorified
As the grain sown into the ground, the Lord died, but as a result He bore much fruit; this 'much fruit' is His glory
Not to mention how they were in the past, even after being saved they still buy many things that the Lord does not want them to buy
We all have to confess that too many times we refuse to do what the Lord wants us to do; instead, we do all the things that the Lord forbids
Whenever we do things according to our own desire instead of according to the Lord's leading, we are covered by a layer of veils
If during the course of one day we have been covered by so many layers of veils, how can the Lord be expressed through us?
He asked the Father to work according to the riches of His glory so that the Triune God may be expressed from within us
Sometimes even in the meetings we are not in our spirit, and it usually takes us half an hour to return to our spirit
It is hard to comprehend the difference between the outer man and the inner man, and we often mistake one for the other
For this reason, Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened, in particular to be strengthened into our inner man
When we pick up something in the department store, and the Lord tells us to put it down, we just cannot put it down
The third time, in verses 17b-19a, he said, 'That you may be full of strength to apprehend and to know the love of Christ'
Verse 17 says, 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love'
Making home has a deeper meaning than staying in a certain place; it does not merely mean to stay somewhere but to settle down there
Christ is in you, but He may be like a guest merely sitting in a chair, leaning against the wall, or standing in the corner
Once your whole being is strengthened into your spirit, He has the ground and the right to settle down and make home in you
We should not think that we have prayed well and that this is enough, because when we struggle with Him, we may not love Him anymore
Although He comes back again a few days later, we do not have peace in our spirit because we always have this kind of struggle within
If we wanted to scold someone, we would just do it, and we were very happy after doing it; we were free to do whatever our heart dictated
In this way, His faith becomes our faith, enabling us to believe Him, and His love becomes our love, enabling us to love Him
Who can tell how wide is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth of the universe?
We all know that many, many solar systems constitute one galaxy, and many, many galaxies constitute the universe
According to the context, this means that due to the Lord's making His home in us, we can experience Him as the unsearchable One
Immediately we can also know His love; that is, we know that His love surpasses human knowledge and understanding
It is very strange that on the one hand, Christ's love surpasses human understanding, but on the other hand, we can know it
Man can neither know nor understand this love, yet we who allow the Lord to make His home in us can know and experience it
The Lord is not satisfied; rather, He longs to dwell in us, making us His home, that He may be our life and nature and become our content
The majority of Christians know only the Lords love in dying on the cross for them they do not know His love in His making His home in them
In 4:3-6 Paul mentions seven 'ones': one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all
The One who dwells in this Body is the Spirit, who is the ultimate manifestation of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In all of our messages, words, truths, and preaching, we should take this as the starting point, the content, and the destination
To the Chinese, to do something in someone's name equals carrying their flag, indicating that you represent that person
To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into a spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God
The first half of verse 23 says, 'The virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel'
In actuality, verse 20 explains verse 18, clearly showing that the One whom she conceived had been begotten in her through the Holy Spirit
That this One is of the Holy Spirit means that He is out of God and comes from God; God had been begotten in her
Verses 21-23 say, 'And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins
At this point we can see that in Matthew 1 the revelation concerning the Triune God is complete and mysterious
In brief, in reference to the Triune God, Matthew chapter one says that God is with us and that He becomes Emmanuel
Why does Matthew 3 say that there is One in heaven One in the air and One in the water yet John indicates that the three are in one another
The Triune God is not composed of three Gods; the Triune God is uniquely one but has the aspect of being three
At this time He came back in resurrection; that is, He came back in the success of having passed through various processes
The Gospel of John tells us that He came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
In eternity past God determined to create, to become flesh, to pass through human living, to be crucified, and to resurrect
Concerning the dispensing of the Triune God, there are a few more crucial verses-2 Corinthians 13:14 and Revelation 1:4-5
Whenever we stay away from the dispensing of the Triune God, our spiritual experiences are empty and worthless
On the positive side, this is to control one's emotions and to not do things according to the dictates of one's heart
At its inception the Lord's recovery in China was deeply influenced by the mystics, especially in the experience of pursuing spiritual life
Later we found that without the Spirit, that kind of exercise is just like the practice of having strict, ascetic rules in religion
The Triune God who has been dispensed into us has an abbreviated title, or we may say a general title-'the Spirit'
Paul wrote fourteen Epistles on the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in which he concluded that we must walk 'by the Spirit'
We should not forget this word: our spiritual experiences are not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit
In Romans 8:4 the word spirit denotes the mingled spirit, that is, our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit to be one spirit
John 3:8 says, 'The wind blows where it wills,' showing that the Lord also referred to the Holy Spirit as 'wind'
Our God is so great, so mysterious, so wonderful, and so 'extractive,' so He had to use a word that is comprehensible to us
Over nineteen hundred years ago He Himself became flesh lived the human life was crucified and resurrected to become the lifegiving Spirit
In the evening on the day of the Lord's resurrection, He breathed the Holy Spirit as the holy breath into the disciples
Christianity calls the Holy Spirit the 'Holy Ghost,' considering Him something objective and vague rather than as a definite person
In this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the experience of human living, the element of crucifixion, and also the element of resurrection
The subject of Romans 84 where it speaks of the spirit is the allinclusive Spirit coming to mingle with our spirit to be the mingled spirit
Even after the argument, they are still very angry, thinking that even if they are wrong, they should still be excused and forgiven
If you throw stones coal or wood into the winepress you will only get some powder you will have no way to press out a drop of oil or wine
The difference is that when the unbelievers get into the winepress, nothing comes out except pieces of coal, wood, and stone
From this we see that we must learn to contact the Lord all the time and allow the Triune God to dispense Himself into us moment by moment
Even if you specialize in a certain subject, the school will provide an education that covers multiple lines rather than just a single line
In the same way, while we are learning to work for the Lord and live for God, we must be equipped in many ways
A person who desires to work for the Lord and live for God must learn many things and be exercised in many aspects
In addition, there are two important things which you need to learn: to exercise faith and to exercise to learn to endure suffering
On the other hand, we should not think that as long as we eat, we will be healthy and strong and will live long
She never went to see a doctor or took medicine in her whole life, so she lived to only around sixty years of age
Even Paul told Timothy, 'No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses'
He told the elders in the church in Ephesus, 'You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me'
It is said that the writer of this hymn is Catherine Booth-Clibborn, the daughter of the founder of the Salvation Army
On the one hand, we need to believe in God, while on the other hand, we need to deal with the environment by faith
In your coordination with the brothers and sisters who work with you, you should also exercise faith and not have your own choice
Of course, we should also not have any anxiety or worry, but we should believe that whenever we have a particular need, God knows about it
They said that the bread was the best local bread because it was made by the only person who knew how to make that kind of bread
If we do not pay attention to a certain thing, we will not suffer because of it, but once we direct our attention to it, we will suffer
Afterward in the next meeting, he shared in the message that co-workers who go out to labor for the Lord should learn to suffer hardships
It has been more than a hundred years since the Presbyterian Church of Scotland brought the gospel to Taiwan in the nineteenth century
According to the statistics of last year this group which has a membership of around 120000 has the greatest number of Christians in Taiwan
At that time, because we went astray slightly by turning our attention to so-called spirituality, it brought in disaster
They were more or less sitting on the fence waiting to see whether my ministry was right or whether Brother AustinSparkss ministry was right
In that hesitating situation, about eighty percent leaned toward my side, while at least twenty percent leaned toward the other side
After twenty-two years of endeavoring, not only has there been an increase, but there has also been propagation
The Lord's recovery quickly spread to the four big continents outside of Asia, and more than three hundred churches were raised up
According to their feeling, if these ones were allowed to continue their work among us, all the other co-workers would have no way to go on
In addition, in the summer there would be the usual big conference for the entire United States followed by the move for propagation
If they do not want to stay in this work, they could go out to do their own work according to their inner feeling
Apparently we have already left the denominations, but actually the things of the denominations are still in our blood
We were sent by the Lord to come here to Taiwan thirty-six years ago, yet this little island of Taiwan has not been gospelized
In other words instead of relying on the big meetings we should build up the gospel the truth and the church life in the homes of the saints
Especially in the past two or three years the Lord's revelation of the truth among us has nearly reached the peak
These truths, which consummate in the New Jerusalem, are crystallized in the book entitled God's New Testament Economy
We are planning to compile all these truths into four volumes in Truth Lessons, with one level for each year and four volumes for each level
Throughout several thousand years of the history of the Chinese nation, we have never had this kind of community
One community consists of a number of high-rise buildings, with around one to two hundred households in each building
We absolutely should not overlook the propagation in the communities; rather, we must aggressively work on this
At present there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan, each of which must have a gospel station, that is, a local church
If the Lord would raise up one thousand full-timers, we would be able to evangelize all the towns within half a year
The primary thing that we must do is to call out one thousand people and to train and equip them like soldiers
When the time comes, these one hundred teams will set out together to one hundred towns and preach the gospel for one month
A month later two people will remain to take care of the new ones while the rest are re-divided to form new teams and go to other towns
We hope that we will be able to labor to the extent that there will be a base for meetings in every high-rise building
At the same time, we will also produce some timely publications which we will be able to use readily during door-knocking
It will be a great thing if we can produce one to two thousand of this kind of people as the foundation and basis for the island of Taiwan
Not only should we be well equipped in life and truth, but we should also be proper in our daily dress and conduct
We have to teach the saints that they should not be loose or dress carelessly whether in the Lords Day meetings or in ordinary home meetings
They will see that not only the standard of our morality is high but also that the way we dress and conduct ourselves is noble
Not only so, we should also know how to eat healthily and live properly so that we may become top citizens in the country
We must follow the Lord in truth and life in order to live a life that is according to the Lord's requirements
We must not waste even a single minute, but rather study the Lord's word whenever we have time so that we may know the truth
Of being wasteful in the use of our energy, time, and money, we should walk according to the Spirit in using them
We should learn to knock on doors to deliver the gospel to people's homes, to talk to them one on one, and to lead them to salvation
We will not only be a group of people with noble personalities and disciplined characters but also people who are useful in the Lord's hand
If the Lord calls us for a need after we have been working for a few years, we should present ourselves to the Lord right away
If we have Paul's intention, when the time comes, God will sovereignly arrange everything to allow us to serve Him full-time
If we continue to hold a job, then the Lord may also arrange the way for us to be a testimony for Him on our job
Wherever we go, we have to go with a spirit of being full-time to raise up churches or function in the church in that locality
We have to show people that although we are Christians, we are one hundred percent different from Christianity
The widespread move of gospelizing, truthizing, and churchizing Taiwan is an unprecedented blessing and even a great act in church history
Not only so, all the churches in the whole island can be divided into four main regions and have blending meetings every season
In the future, after we have gospelized Taiwan and established churches in every village, we will need this kind of blending desperately
Being able to render help to others depends on life, and being fruitful in gospel preaching also depends on life
It is one thing for a sloppily dressed person to go door-knocking; it is another thing for a well-mannered person to do it
If we were to do it, however, the result would be very different because we are not as advanced in life as Paul was
Once there was a brother in the church who was a doctor and who opened a gospel clinic next to meeting hall number three in Taipei
The four major fundamentalist denominations are the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, and the Episcopalians
Among them, some theologians might have studied this matter a little, but as a whole they do not pay much attention to it
After seeing much light at the age of twenty-five, he became one of the founders of the recovery that took place among the Brethren
The inception of the Presbyterian churches and the Baptist churches was related to the Reformation led by Martin Luther
During the Reformation, Luther was constantly being threatened by the Catholic Church, and his life was always in danger
At that time the Catholic Churchs power was extremely great and the popes political authority was greater than that of any of the monarchs
Until today many German citizens pay a church tax, and the government participates in the administration of the church
In the same way, at his birth every Englishman becomes not only a subject of Great Britain but also a member of the Anglican Church
Due to the mixture of politics and religion, the situation of the state churches is very confusing and has a strong political flavor
Soon afterward, however, some of the Lord's lovers who emerged from northern Europe studied the Scriptures and saw the truth of baptism
Later the so-called Baptist Church reached America and was divided into the Northern Baptist Church and the Southern Baptist Church
Of all the different schools of fundamental theology, reformed theology, which is related to Luther and Calvin, is the worst
They do not acknowledge that the believers have two natures, the new nature and the old nature, an old man and a new man within them
Despite its decline in Europe, this school of thought still gradually spread to America, especially in the area around Chicago
In the matter of truth we have received a great deal of help from the Brethren-in particular, concerning the interpretation of prophecies
Panton were very thorough and precise in their studies, always interpreting the Bible according to the accurate meaning of the words
Based on their interpretations and standing on their shoulders we have examined and pursued the truth and have gone on to see deeper things
In order to go forth to work for the Lord, first we must equip ourselves that we may be enriched in the knowledge of the truth
If we do this, whenever we speak, we will be able to present the truth clearly and reasonably, and those who hear us will also be convinced
The present world has been polluted by Christianity for more than one thousand years, so the truth of God has no way to spread
As those who serve the Lord we must be equipped in these two matters: the growth in life and the familiarity with the truth
We have to spend time to study every page of every book that has been published from the time of Brother Nee until this day
It is neither a boast nor a deception to say that all the books in the Lord's recovery are the extracts of the truths in Christianity
We should endeavor to enter into all these spiritual riches and not waste our time or money on other unnecessary pursuits
Every day we must pray, fellowship with the Lord, and confess our sins, not allowing any barrier to remain between us and the Lord
In hospitals, doctors and nurses contact all kinds of patients every day and are contaminated by different kinds of germs
Two people can do the same thing, but the weightiness of the action does not depend on the action itself, but on the person who is doing it
The way you comb your hair and present your face reveals what kind of person you are; it depicts your character to the uttermost
Even non-Christians, if they are upright, know that clothes that expose the chest and arms are improper and inappropriate
The reason that human beings need to wear clothing is because man sinned and as a result gained a sense of shame toward his nakedness
Originally, man did not have to wear clothes because he did not have sin or know sin and thus did not have the sense of shame
Clothing in the Bible is not primarily for protecting us from the cold but for covering our body to remove our shame of nakedness
Nonetheless, according to the principle, firstly, we should cover our body; secondly, we should not overexpose our figure
Suppose we were to wear a strange garment that was very colorful with two red stripes in the front and two yellow stripes on the shoulders
Even if we go to regions like India, Burma, and Africa, as long as we can speak a little English, we will be able to travel anywhere freely
Since Taiwan is a center and base of the Lord's recovery, many saints from different countries all over the world will come to visit
Generally speaking, if we want to serve the Lord full-time, we should be familiar with at least four languages
Suppose that right now we had five hundred full-timers who were devoted to laboring in the communities in Taipei
If there is no longer the need to take care of the towns and villages, all of the full-timers can stay in Taipei to labor in the communities
The book of Acts shows us that when the number of saved ones in Jerusalem increased, they should have spread out for propagation
At Paul's time, people could communicate and fellowship with one another only through sailboats or the Roman highways
We can communicate conveniently through airplanes, telephones, telegrams, computers, television, and radio broadcasts
Even if someone were an all-powerful 'giant' who was able to do everything, he still could not be separated from the church
Those who cause trouble are those who think that they are capable of doing something and who try to accomplish something
While you are still young, learn to eat food without grease and heavy seasoning, and over a period of time you will be accustomed to it
He has been laboring for the Lord faithfully, but because he is overly fatigued, the level of his white blood cells has gone up too high
Do not think that since you are still young and have inexhaustible energy, you can use it excessively all the time
American foods are very nutritious yet the probability of Americans having high blood pressure heart disease and strokes is also quite high
Remember that you should not get angry about anything or with anybody; in particular, husbands and wives should not be angry with each other
Concerning the matter of financial support for the carrying out of the entire move of the Lord here, the need is extremely great
During my absence, my wife with our three children was so impoverished that they were about to run out of food
Just as she was rising up after she had finished praying and was going to put the children to bed, an elderly sister came
That elderly sister had not had any previous contact with my wife and had not been attending the meetings regularly
Upon entering my home, she said a few sentences to my wife which meant: 'This is what the Lord has prepared for you'
Later that elderly sister told us that on that night she was reminded of my wife and our three children and suddenly felt so troubled within
Rather, we should believe that we are in His hands and that He will take care of us and sustain us in a practical way
Rather, we should live a normal and proper life, being regulated in our daily activities at home, including our eating
On the one hand, we should never sacrifice our health for the sake of saving money, for this would be an offense to the Lord
Please remember that one day we all will stand before the judgment seat of the Lord to give an account of everything
