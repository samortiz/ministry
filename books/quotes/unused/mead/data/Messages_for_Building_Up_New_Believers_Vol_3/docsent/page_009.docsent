   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NOT AFFECTING SPIRITUALITY A. Hopkins s Rabbits and Small Prints</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Finally, let me tell you a simple story.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Keswick Convention is a big gathering in England, a somewhat international conference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every year approximately five or six thousand people from all over the world gather there for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I think that God has greatly used these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Andrew Murray and F. B. Meyer, both of whom had a deep knowledge of the Lord, have been among the speakers at these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During this period of time, Stock Meyer was in Germany, Melton was in France, Andrew Murray was in Holland, and Evan Hopkins was in England.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hopkins was known as the Theologian of Keswick.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was the first person to see the truth of the believers crucifixion with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was the husband of Hannah Whitall Smith, the author of The Christian s Secret of a Happy Life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis would not have been able to propagate the truth of crucifixion with Christ without the help of Hopkins, because Britain could not quite accept a female preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hopkins was a very proper person before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet he had a hobby; he loved to draw whenever he was free.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At first he drew serious subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later when he had a granddaughter, he began to draw rabbits for her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he came back from giving a sermon, he would draw rabbits for his granddaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During his lifetime, he drew thousands of rabbits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later some publishers put out a book on Hopkins s rabbits.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hopkins was an intelligent man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He made the face of every rabbit look different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also liked to print fine calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wrote the whole of the Lord s prayer on a shilling note.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am not saying that you should imitate him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am merely saying this to show you that recreation does not affect one s spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, one touches the human element of a person through his hobbies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please remember that God s servants are not staid people; that is Catholicism, not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christians are plain, simple, and natural people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. George M ller Praying for Woolen Yarn</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>on Behalf of a Little Girl</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>George M ller was a person who was experienced in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a girl named Abigail asked him to pray for colored woolen yarn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He prayed about this and she received the yarn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The girl grew up to become one of the best Christians in England.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In reading her biography, one is impressed by the lessons she learned in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Recreation will not drag a person down if it is done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you keep the proper principle of recreation before the Lord, recreation will uplift you and restore your body and mind to proper health.</S>
