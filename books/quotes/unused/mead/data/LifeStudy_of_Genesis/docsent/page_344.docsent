   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Well for Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise the Lord that there is another well the well for Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>22-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many verses in the Bible speak of this positive well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 36:8 says, "Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord likes to make us drink of His river of pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that God Himself will be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 7:37 and 38 the Lord Jesus also spoke of drinking: "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, in 1 Corinthians 12:13, the Apostle Paul says that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit, that is, of one well of water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even the last chapter of the Bible contains a word about drinking: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!..Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely" Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This divine well must be the source of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Christ has been brought forth and has grown up, in the church life we still must learn that there are two sources or two kinds of living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What kind of living do you have the living of Ishmael or the living of Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is insufficient merely to say that you have the living of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must examine the kind of water you are drinking day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Are you drinking of the well for Ishmael?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are, that well will make you an Ishmael and will cause you to drift into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are you drinking of the well for Isaac, the well which signifies the divine well, the well of Christ, the well of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are drinking of this well, the divine water which flows out of it will accomplish a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>a In Beer-sheba Close to the Land of the Philistines</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The well for Isaac was in Beer-sheba, close to the land of the Philistines vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>25-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This well, unlike the well for Ishmael, is not near Egypt but at the border of the land of the Philistines and the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Beer-sheba was in the land of the Philistines and later became the southernmost part of the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When describing the geography of the Holy Land, the Bible even uses the phrase "from Dan to Beer-sheba" 1 Sam 3:20 , because the distance from Dan in the north to Beer-sheba in the south includes the whole land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible the land of the Philistines has a peculiar significance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a place which rejects God absolutely; it is a place which accepts God but handles the things of God according to human cleverness, not according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consider as an illustration the way in which the Philistines handled the ark 1 Sam 6:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did not reject it; they received it, but they handled it in a natural way according to their cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, in Genesis 20 and 21 we see that Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, did not reject God but accepted Him in his own clever way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham took God according to His economy; Abimelech took Him according to the way of human cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the significance of the land of the Philistines.</S>
