Instead, this chapter speaks concerning multiplication, the drawing of all men to the Lord, the judgment of the world, and the casting out of the ruler of this world. In order for all men to be drawn to the Lord so that He might be multiplied, it was necessary for the world system, which usurps mankind, to be judged. Fallen mankind is under the tyranny, the usurpation, of the world, just as the children of Israel were under the tyranny and usurpation of Pharaoh in Egypt. After God judged Egypt and Pharaoh, Pharaoh let the children of Israel go. Likewise, the world, which usurps the children of God, has been judged. When the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross, the world was judged. This is the reason Paul could say, &#8220;The world has been crucified to me and I to the world&#8221; (Gal. 6:14). This makes it possible for God&#8217;s chosen people to be released from the world. Furthermore, the ruler of this world has been cast out. In the sight of God and in the sight of the angels, demons, and Satan, this world has been judged, condemned, and its ruler has been cast out. Therefore, the world and its ruler, Satan, are powerless to hold us.<h2 class=head2>Realizing That We Are Christ&#8217;s Glorification</h2><p>Through the Lord&#8217;s death the divine life within Him was released. Then in resurrection He imparted this life to God&#8217;s chosen people. In this way God&#8217;s people have become His multiplication, a multiplication which is His glorification.<p>No one in history has been glorified in such a way as the Lord Jesus. Today there are Christians all over the world. Even though many believers are weak, it cannot be denied that Christians are Christ&#8217;s multiplication and glorification.<p>Unfortunately, many believers do not realize that they are Christ&#8217;s glorification. Have you ever realized that you are a part of Christ&#8217;s glorification? Probably you have not realized this. Perhaps your understanding of Christ&#8217;s death has been according to traditional teaching. Most of the biblical truths, including the truth concerning redemption, have been leavened. As a result, very few Christians know the truth in a complete and pure way. On the contrary, nearly every truth has been leavened, reduced, and covered. Therefore, I hope that we all shall see that the Lord&#8217;s death was not only for redemption, but was also for His glorification through multiplication. We are His multiplication, and as His multiplication we are His glorification.<p>After the Lord predicted His glorification, He went on to give a lengthy message concerning it, a message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. In chapter fourteen we have the Father&#8217;s house; in chapter fifteen, the vine with all its branches; and in chapter sixteen, the newborn man. The Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man are all the result of Christ&#8217;s multiplication; they are the issue of His reproduction. As we have pointed out in previous messages, the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man are the Lord&#8217;s glorification. Therefore, in 17:1 He prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; This means that in chapter seventeen the Lord prayed for His multiplication, which would be the issue, the result, of His death. As a grain of wheat, He fell into the ground and died, and then He rose up to become many grains. Now these grains have become the Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man for His expression. This, therefore, is the purpose of Christ&#8217;s death unfolded in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S BOLDNESS IN PRESENTING HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH</h2><p>After praying for His glorification, the Lord presented Himself in chapter eighteen to be arrested, tried, judged, and put to death. The Lord Jesus boldly presented Himself for death. He knew where He would be arrested. In chapter thirteen the Lord even encouraged Judas. He told the disciples that one of them would betray Him. Then He gave a morsel to the betrayer, to Judas, and said to him, &#8220;What you do, do more quickly&#8221; (13:27). After Judas took the morsel and went out, the Lord again spoke concerning His glorification: &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately&#8221; (vv. 31-32). The Lord Jesus certainly knew that the time had come for Him to be put to death. However, He spoke not of being put to death, but of being glorified. His word in 13:31-32 corresponds to His prayer in chapter seventeen, the prayer that the Father might glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him. To glorify the Son actually means to put the Son to death. Hence, by praying for His glorification the Lord was praying concerning His death.<p>John 18:1 says, &#8220;When Jesus said these things, He went forth with His disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered and His disciples.&#8221; The Lord delivered Himself of His own accord to the process of death, as He mentioned in 10:17-18. He did this voluntarily and boldly. He went to the garden where He knew that He would be betrayed. For what purpose was He betrayed? He was betrayed in order that He might be put to death so that He might be multiplied. May we all have a clear vision concerning this.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_201.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_203.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 202</div><br></body></html>
