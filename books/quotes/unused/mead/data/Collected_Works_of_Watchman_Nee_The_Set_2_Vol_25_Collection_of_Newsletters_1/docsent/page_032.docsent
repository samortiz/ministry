   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A REPORT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the record from after a table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 133:1: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today I see many brothers and sisters here and I feel very joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have been away from you for seven months, but in these seven months, I have never once found a meeting like the one here in Shanghai, so I often have thought how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever I was alone in Ch'ang-sha Hunan province a thousand miles away and could not be together with you, my heart was grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So I often asked the Lord to raise up some brothers and sisters there, so we can meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank the Lord; He heard my prayer, and the work has begun there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, I want to tell the brothers and sisters a little bit about how it happened in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have been in Hunan for seven months.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I came back this time because I have a month of vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I went to Ch'ang-sha, the brothers put me on a boat, and before they left, we prayed for a short while.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One sentence of Brother Chang's prayer helped me the most; I have not forgotten it even now.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sentence was, "God, please go before him and begin the work."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This one sentence really moved my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Afterward, I also prayed with this sentence, saying, "God, I am a useless person; I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must begin the work there before I can work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>O God, if You want me to do something, please begin the work."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me begin by saying something in regard to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the beginning, the assistant director of our hospital, Doctor Ku, was very happy to see me come; he invited me to eat with him many times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One time he invited the members of the Siang Ya Medical School YMCA among whom there are some Christians .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He also invited me to go with him, and we talked about the meetings there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Originally, they had a prayer meeting every Friday, but for some unknown reason it had stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time, we decided to resume the prayer meeting but changed the time to every Wednesday.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Che Ya YMCA invited me and two other people, Dr. Ke and Dr. Liu, to help with this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They came the first time, but later, perhaps because they were busy or had other frustrations, they did not come often.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But among the students there was a great number who wanted the meeting and who had a heart to get some help.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So I asked the Lord to begin the work there, and I also preached the gospel to them through this prayer meeting because many of them had not been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because they were unsaved, their prayers were like incantations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I told them that the prayer meeting was on Wednesday, and that we should use more time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But because many were not saved, we could only preach the gospel more before working on prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way, I preached the gospel first, and in the fourth week some got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, I felt we should have a counseling meeting, so they would have more opportunity to understand the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So I decided to have two times on the Lord's Day morning, one at 9:00 a.m. and one at 10:00 a.m. for such talks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They could not all come at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although many had questions, the questions were not too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There were just a few, and once they were answered, it was over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, I used this time to preach the gospel also.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At this time two sisters got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It happened in this way: After my speaking once, everyone else left, but these two remained.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At first I did not know what they were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I noticed they were crying and knew they were repenting for their past because they were very zealous before and later they had become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I told them that the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed for their sins and that they could be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as they believed that the Lord Jesus was their Savior, their sins would be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then I comforted them with a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After this, they came to the meetings often and were more eager than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I met the elder brother of one of these sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was my fellow student at Ya Li University.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said, "My sister is very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She even eats early because your meeting is at seven o'clock."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a Bible study on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I realized that they were very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes they skipped their meal in order to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, I saw that their personal lives had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From their own mouths, I found out that they were pursuing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They were dealing with many matters of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One other person was saved in a very marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A nursing school invited me to preach the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I went, I met a person on the way, and he asked me where I was going.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I said, "I am going to preach the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you want to go with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said yes and followed me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That day I spoke of salvation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Most marvelously, he was saved at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Afterward, he came to speak with me often, and he became very seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, he has already read The Spiritual Man up to the second volume.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I was meeting in the hospital, he came often, but after the meeting moved to the campus, he did not come.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said it was because it seemed inconvenient to him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But no matter what, he is a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is a pharmacist in the pharmacy at our hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is one other matter which delighted me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There was a female student who was about eighteen years old who came to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She was probably invited by a fellow student.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After the meeting she still would not leave.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She just stood there as if she wanted to speak with me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then she told me she wanted to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>So I asked her whether or not she had believed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She said that she had believed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I said that if she had believed, she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The next time I ran into her, I asked her whether she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>She told me joyfully that she was.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Later, she kept coming to the meetings and always brought other students with her to the meetings.</S>
