   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. BY ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament, God s salvation and the kingdom always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many pay close attention to God s salvation but neglect the kingdom, considering that the kingdom is a matter related only to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, the kingdom is part of God s salvation that we obtain today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have been saved, we are in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the natural and religious concept, the purpose of repentance and regeneration is to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, according to the New Testament, the purpose of repentance and regeneration is to provide us with an entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, preached the gospel of repentance for the kingdom, saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, when the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He continued the preaching of John the Baptist, also saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 3 the Lord Jesus also said to Nicodemus, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . When we believe into the Lord, we are regenerated, and through regeneration we enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the kingdom is present, and every regenerated believer in Christ has entered into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Testament reveals that repentance and regeneration, through believing in the Lord, are primarily for the kingdom, not salvation; moreover, God s salvation and the kingdom are mutually related.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some Bible teachers have said that the kingdom is a matter related only to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They teach that Christ brought the kingdom with Him and presented it to the Jewish people and that it has been suspended and postponed because the Jewish people rejected it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, these teachers think that the present age is not the age of the kingdom but the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They completely separate the kingdom from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, the New Testament clearly shows that where salvation is, there the kingdom is also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, the New Testament reveals that where the church is, there is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 14:17 says, The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The context of this verse is the church life; therefore, this verse is strong proof that the church in the present age is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, in Revelation 1:9 John writes, I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This verse indicates that John and other believers were already in the kingdom because of their exercise in tribulation and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These verses in the Scriptures reveal that the kingdom exists in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The kingdom, which includes God s salvation and the church, is present today.</S>
