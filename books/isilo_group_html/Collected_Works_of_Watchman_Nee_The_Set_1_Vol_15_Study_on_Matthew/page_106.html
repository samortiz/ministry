"At that time" refers to the time of the parousia (the rapture). The kingdom of the heavens is not synonymous with the church. The term "church" was used in Paul's time. When the term is qualified by the name of a locality, such as "the church in Laodicea," it refers to a local church. When there is no qualifier, it refers to the Body of Christ. The church speaks of God's grace, while the kingdom of the heavens speaks of God's righteousness; it speaks of the scope of God's reign. Since the "virgins" refer to the Christians and the "bridegroom" refers to the Lord, why is there no bride? It is because the bride of Revelation 21 is the New Jerusalem, which includes Jesus and the church. Here we have only the church; hence, it can be called only a virgin and not the bride.</P><P>The number ten in the Scriptures alludes to the major  four complete numbers in the Scriptures: three (God's completion), seven (a temporary completion), ten (man's completion), and twelve (eternal completion). In Revelation 21 everything is of the number twelve: the gates, the pearls, the names of the apostles, the tribes of Israel, the precious stones, and the height of one hundred and forty-four cubits (twelve times twelve). Prior to this, seven was the number of completion. Beginning with the new heaven and the new earth in chapter twenty-one, the number twelve is used throughout.</P><P>Three is God's number, and four is man's number. Seven equals three plus four-God's number plus man's number. The number seven can be split up; therefore, it signifies a temporary completeness. Twelve equals three times four-God's number times man's number. It cannot be split up, and therefore signifies eternal completion.</P><P>Ten is only a little less than the number for eternal completion. When two is added to ten, the sum is twelve, signifying eternal completion. The two grinding at the mill in chapter twenty-four represent the believers who are alive. The ten virgins in chapter twenty-five represent the believers who are dead, that is, those who have "slept." In the Greek and Hebrew languages, twelve is spoken as two plus ten. Twelve is the base number and two is the remainder.</P><P>In Genesis 42:3 and 4 there are ten older brothers and two younger brothers; in Numbers 14:37-38 ten spies were with Joshua and Caleb; in 1 Kings 11:29-31 the prophet rent the garment into twelve pieces. The twelve pieces were divided into ten pieces and two pieces. Therefore, as ten is the major part of the whole, the dead believers occupy a major part of all the believers. In Matthew 20:24, ten disciples argued with the two. We have other proofs: Genesis 24:10; Judg. 6:27; Ruth 4:2; Luke 19:13. The beast has ten horns; the revived Roman Empire is divided into ten parts.</P><P>As in all parables, the virgins here cannot be regarded as literal. The virgins are we who have been regenerated by the Lord. The term virgin does not refer to chastity. Even a married woman can be chaste. A virgin is a girl who is not yet married, one who is hidden away. Therefore, virgin cannot refer to the Jews or the unbelievers. Only Christians can bear this title.</P><P>The virgins' only goal is to take their lamps to meet the bridegroom. The lamp in the Bible has many meanings: (1) the word of Jehovah (Psa. 119:105); (2) prophecy (2 Pet. 1:19); or (3) Christian behavior (Matt. 5:14-16). The word used here is not "candle." A candle burns its own oil, but the oil of a lamp comes from outside. The behavior of a Christian should be a proclamation to all of the coming of the Bridegroom. The reason that we preach the gospel is that the Lord is coming soon. In breaking the bread we: (1) remember the Lord's work and (2) remember the Lord's soon return.</P><P>Verses 2-4:"And five of them were foolish and five were prudent. For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps." There are two kinds of virgins in verses 2-4. Many Bible expositors consider the five foolish virgins to be unsaved persons, but there are a few dozen sure proofs that will refute such suppositions. We will list only fifteen major reasons to prove that these are saved ones:</P><P>(1) They were all virgins. To the very end they were called virgins. The Lord never questioned this point; He recognized this fact.</P><P>(2) There was light in their lamps (v. 8). This light lasted through half the night, proving that it was of the Holy Spirit which issued forth in good works that glorified God. In verse 8, "are going out" indicates that there was still some light that had not yet died out.</P><P>(3) They all went forth to meet the bridegroom. An unsaved one surely will not welcome the Bridegroom. (Would bandits light lamps to meet the army?)</P><P>(4) "But at midnight there was a cry,...Go forth to meet him!" The archangel will not make any mistake in calling the ten; neither will the Lord call them by the wrong names.</P><P>(5) Having oil in their lamps but not in their vessels. Oil refers to the Holy Spirit; hence, the foolish virgins must be saved ones.</P><P>(6) All the virgins arose. Verse 7 refers to resurrection. The saved ones and the unsaved ones are not resurrected together. They are resurrected one thousand years apart.</P><P>(7) The five prudent virgins went in with Him (v. 10). They were caught up into the air. The five foolish virgins followed afterward, being caught up together in the air also. The only difference is that the five foolish virgins could not partake of the feast.</P><P>(8) The ten virgins differ only in behavior but not in nature. There is no distinction of true and false ones, only a distinction of prudent and foolish ones. Foolish does not mean unsaved.</P><P>(9) Their lamps were going out because of the tarrying of the bridegroom. If He had not tarried, they would have been qualified to be caught up together with the prudent ones.</P><P>(10) They were still virgins in verse 11. When they came they had already bought oil and brought it with them.</P><P>(11) The word "buy" in Matthew 25:9 cannot be used to speak of unsaved persons; only the word "ask" could have been used, because grace is free. Only the saved ones can buy, that is, pay the price.</P><P>(12) Suppose the five foolish virgins were not saved. This would indicate that dead people can still be saved, because the prudent ones advised them to go and buy oil.</P><P>(13) Suppose the five foolish virgins were not saved. The five prudent virgins would not then say, "Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you"; they would not have turned them down. If the five foolish ones were not saved, the five prudent ones would have been willing to pay any price for them. How could they not save those who are dying?</P><P>(14) The Lord said, "Watch therefore." Those who can watch, as in verse 13, must have life. If the five foolish ones are unsaved, they cannot be told to watch; rather, they can be told only to repent.</P><P>(15) Compare Matthew 25 to the gospel feast in Matthew 22. There we have a lost one at the feast. Here the words are spoken to the disciples, that is, the saved ones only. Chapter twenty-two deals with the problem of salvation and perdition, but chapter twenty-five has nothing to do with salvation or perdition. In chapter twenty-two the lost one is bound and cannot do anything, whereas in chapter twenty-five they are still free and can do many things. Chapter twenty-two is concerned with the king's gain or loss, while chapter twenty-five is concerned with the virgins' gain or loss. Salvation is a glory to the King, but the kingdom of the heavens is a gain for the prudent virgins. Today, when they expound the Bible, believers speak only of the problem of salvation. They do not know that after salvation there is still the problem of the kingdom.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_105.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_107.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 106</div><br></body></html>
