   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Putting on the Breastplate of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience, signified by the breast.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fighting against Satan who accuses us, we need a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of how clear we feel our conscience is, it needs to be covered with the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The One who covers our conscience and guards us from Satan s accusations is Christ Himself 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, Christ covers us as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, the breastplate of righteousness is also related to the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In experience, we cannot separate the blood from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apart from His blood, Christ cannot not cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under the cleansing of His blood, Christ becomes our righteousness, which covers our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Shodding Our Feet with</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>the Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 6:15 says, Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our feet must be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The firm foundation of the gospel of peace means the establishing of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the cross Christ made peace for us both with God and man, and this peace has become our gospel 2:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being thus shod, we will have a firm footing so that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The peace for such a firm foundation is Christ v. 14 . We fight in peace and with peace; we fight by standing in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and to be one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand fast against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Taking Up the Shield of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 6:16 continues, Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Flaming darts were used by fighters in the apostle s time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle used this term to illustrate Satan s attacks on us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The flaming darts are Satan s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To quench the fiery darts of the evil one, we need to take up the shield of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The shield of faith is not something that we put on but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the Author and Perfecter of our faith Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Receiving the Helmet of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 6:17 says, Receive the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Receiving the helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts shot at us by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a helmet, such a covering, is God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s salvation is the covering that we take up against all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Receiving the Sword of the Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Which Spirit Is the Word of God,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>by Means of All Prayer and Petition</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul goes on to speak of the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sword is an item in the armor that is used for attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This verse shows that the Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both the Spirit and the word are Christ 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit is the sword itself, not the swordsman.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word of God is also the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sword is the Spirit, and the Spirit is also the word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our Christian experience, the word and the Spirit need to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the Spirit and the word; He is not only the Spirit, nor is He only the word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The unique offensive weapon in our spiritual warfare against the enemy is the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The phrase by means of all prayer and petition at the beginning of verse 18 modifies the word receive in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By prayer we receive both the helmet of salvation and the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The modifying phrase by means of all prayer and petition in verse 18 is related to all six items of the armor covered in verses 14 through 17.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is by means of all prayer and petition that we gird our loins with truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, shod our feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, take up the shield of faith, and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Prayer is the unique way to apply the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, prayer is crucial and vital.</S>
