<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Rom. 6:6; 8:17-23, 29-30; Eph. 1:3, 5; 2:6; Phil. 3:20-21; Col. 1:14, 18-20; 3:11; Heb. 2:9-10, 14-15; 1 Pet. 1:18-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION ACCOMPLISHING GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>God in His plan wants all things to be filled with Christ and to express Christ&rsquo;s glory, and He also wants a group of people to have Christ&rsquo;s life and glory so that they may be Christ&rsquo;s many brothers. God created all things through Christ (Heb. 2:10). Even though creation expresses the beauty, glory, and might of Christ (Rom. 1:20), it does not fully express Christ or His glory. God created man through Christ and according to Christ; hence, man is higher than all the other creatures. As the head of creation, man has Christ&rsquo;s image to represent Christ, and man can exercise dominion over all creation on Christ&rsquo;s behalf (Gen. 1:26). Nevertheless, created man has only the human life, not Christ&rsquo;s uncreated divine life and glory. Although man represents Christ in image and position, he cannot express Christ in life and glory. Created man has Christ&rsquo;s image and likeness but not Christ&rsquo;s life and nature. Apart from the divine life, man cannot fully express Christ inwardly, fully represent Him outwardly, or be His brothers. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan was not accomplished with creation alone. God needed redemption to complete His plan.</p>
<p>In order to hinder God&rsquo;s desire that Christ would be expressed, Satan came in to corrupt the man whom God had created. Satan knew that God&rsquo;s plan involved man, that man was the center of all things, and that all creation was focused on man. In his corruption of man, Satan tried to ruin God&rsquo;s central purpose in man as well as ruin all created things. As a result of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, man was filled with sin and death, and all things were made subject to vanity and brought under the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20-21). According God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness, corrupted man and all things should have been destroyed. However, because of His love for man and all creation, Christ came to redeem man and to free creation from the slavery of corruption so that God&rsquo;s plan could be accomplished. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan is completed by Christ in His redemption (v. 23).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption was according to His eternal plan. God&rsquo;s redemption was not an afterthought, as merely a remedy to solve a problem; it was determined from the beginning. Christ was prepared by God before the foundation of the world to accomplish redemption (1 Pet. 1:18-20). When God made His plan in eternity, He determined that Christ would accomplish redemption. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION BEING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan was made in Christ and is carried out through Christ. God created all things in Christ and through Christ, and God&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished in Christ and through Christ. Nothing was created apart from Christ, and God cannot accomplish redemption apart from Christ. Every aspect and detail of God&rsquo;s redemption are in Christ and through Christ. God accomplished redemption in Christ and through Christ, and God enables man to partake of His redemption in Christ and through Christ. All the blessings of His redemption&mdash;including the forgiveness of sins, sanctification, justification, regeneration, eternal life, sonship, the redemption of our body, and entering into glory&mdash;are given to man in Christ and through Christ (Eph. 1:3, 5; 2:6; Phil. 3:20-21; Col. 1:14). A person is redeemed in Christ and through Christ. There is not one aspect of God&rsquo;s redemption that is not in Christ and through Christ, because God delights in Christ having the first place in all things (vv. 18-20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION BEING FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption is not only in Christ and through Christ; it is accomplished for Christ. God accomplished redemption through Christ in order to gain men for Christ, that is, to gain men who would be partners with Christ in His life and glory. Furthermore, God accomplished redemption through Christ in order to restore all things for the expression of His glory so that Christ might have the first place in all things. On the one hand, the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption in Christ is to rescue fallen man so that the man created according to Christ&rsquo;s image might have Christ&rsquo;s life and enter into Christ&rsquo;s glory to be the same as Christ. On the other hand, the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is for Christ to fill all things (Eph. 4:10). When all things are renewed, the glory of Christ will be expressed through all things, and He will gain a group of redeemed people as His partners in His divine life and glory. This is what God wants to accomplish for Christ through His redemption.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
