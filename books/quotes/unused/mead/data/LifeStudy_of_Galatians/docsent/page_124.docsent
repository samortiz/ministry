   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR WALKING BY THE SPIRIT AS SONS OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 4-6, 9-11, 13-16, 23, 26, 29; Gal 3:2-3, 5, 11b-14, 26; 4:4-6, 29; 5:16-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament the books of Romans and Galatians stand together in a special category.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two books reveal not only God s redemption, but also the economy of God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Redemption is one thing, and the economy of redemption is another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When many Christians read the books of Romans and Galatians, they can easily see the matter of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, very few see God s economy of redemption, because this matter is somewhat hidden in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the word economy cannot be found either in Romans or in Galatians, the fact of the economy of redemption can nonetheless be found in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our burden in this message is to consider God s economy in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD S GOAL IN REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although redemption is covered both in Romans and in Galatians, redemption is not God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, it is a process, or step, toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God s economy redemption is used to bring forth a certain issue or result.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is God s goal in redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Also, what is the issue produced by God s redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The answer to both questions is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sonship is both God s goal in redemption and the issue of the process of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, many Christians only see that Romans covers justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not see the divine sonship in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we read Romans carefully, we shall see that justification by faith is covered for the most part in the first four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Beginning with chapter five, Paul moves on toward the goal of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the revelation found in the book of Romans, God is transforming sinners into sons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the book of Romans shows us how God is in the process of producing sons out of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we see God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s economy is not simply to redeem lost sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His economy is to redeem sinners with a view to making them His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God s economy the two main matters are redemption and sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is not for doctrine, theology, or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Trinity is for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His economy, God the Father is the One who plans, who forms an eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because He has a purpose, a plan, He has a great many arrangements to correspond to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Trinity, God the Father is the source, the One who plans to accomplish His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the carrying out of the divine economy, two crucial matters must be worked out redemption and sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Galatians 4 we see that the Father sent forth His Son to accomplish redemption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He sent forth the Spirit of His Son to bring forth the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, for the accomplishment of His economy, the Father sent forth first the Son and then the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Galatians 4:4 and 5 say, But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the accomplishment of redemption, it was necessary for the Son of God to become a human being born of a woman and born under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to put on humanity, a human nature, He had to come of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a heresy to say that Mary was the mother of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Jesus was God incarnated as a man, Mary was not the mother of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She was the mother of the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By coming of a woman, Jesus, the Son of God, was a man with blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If He had not had blood and flesh, there would have been no way for the Son of God to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Redemption required the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the Son of God accomplished redemption for us, the Spirit was sent to carry out the sonship and to make it real to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit was sent to make all the redeemed ones sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, Christ came for redemption, and the Spirit came for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ redeemed us, and the Spirit imparts the divine life into us to make us sons of God.</S>
