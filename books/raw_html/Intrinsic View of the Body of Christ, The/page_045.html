<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Oneness of the One Father as the Source</H2><P>The oneness in reality is also the oneness of the one Father as the source, who is over all, through all, and in all (Eph. 4:6). Paul described the oneness in such a fine way. He showed us that God the Father is the source of our oneness, the Lord is the element of our oneness, and the Spirit is the essence of our oneness. The Father as the source, the origin, is now over us, through us, and in us. He is the saturating One and the permeating One. Actually, the Father Himself is triune. He is the triune Father because He is in three directions&#151;over all, through all, and in all. Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the source, the element, and the essence of the oneness in reality.</P><P>We need to be in a trance to see this. We do not want to remain in the natural field. We want to be in a trance, in an invisible sphere, to see the invisible reality of the oneness of the Body of Christ. When we are in such a trance, we can see Christ in one another. Why are we one? Why do we sing the same and pray the same? Although we are of different races and from different places we are one because the same One is over us all, through us all, and in us all. We are in something that is invisible&#151;the oneness in reality.</P><P>When we were born again, we were immediately delivered into this oneness. When a child is born, he is delivered into a family and becomes a member of that family. In the same way, when we were born again, we became members of God's family. Recently, a Russian couple came to a church meeting in Anaheim and asked how they could become members of our church. I dared not to disturb the meeting, but within me I said, "You have already received your membership." After being delivered, a newborn son has already received his sonship, his membership into his family. Since we have been born of God, we all are members of the great oneness of God's family. This is the reality, and we are in this reality.</P><P>After we have been regenerated, however, we Christians have a long way to walk, a long way to go. I have been on this way for over sixty-six years. The longer the way is, the more trouble there is. Today we may all be happy. We may declare, "Hallelujah! We are one!" Later, however, a "barking dog" may trouble us. In Philippians 3:2 Paul told the Philippians to "beware of the dogs." These dogs were the religious Judaizers.</P><P>Today you may be so happy in the enjoyment of the divine oneness, but later someone may come to poison you with doubts, rumors, and other negative things. They may even give you some negative literature to read. Then you will wonder, "Is the local church like this?" You may then begin to think that you came to the wrong place and that you were born into the wrong family. By receiving these negative things, your enjoyment of the oneness has been cut off. This one who came to you from outside the recovery may be considered as an "outdoor barking dog."</P>
