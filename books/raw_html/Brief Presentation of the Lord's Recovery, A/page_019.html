<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH GROUND</H2><P>Following the above six main items of the Lord's recovery, I would like to add two more items, that is, the recovery of the church ground and the recovery of the practice of the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Definition of the Church Ground</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not the Foundation but the Site</H2><P>The word ground that we use in reference to the church ground does not carry the denotation of a foundation, like the foundation of a building; it bears the denotation of a site, like the site on which the foundation of a building is laid.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Three Crucial Elements<br>of the Church Ground</H2><P>According to the divine revelation of the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements, as follows:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Unique Oneness of the Universal Body of Christ</H2><P>The first element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, which is called "the oneness of the Spirit" (Eph. 4:3). This is the oneness that the Lord prayed for in John 17. It is a oneness of the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ. This oneness is in the name of the Father (John 17:6, 11), denoting the Father's person, in which is the Father's life. This oneness is even in the Triune God through sanctification by His holy word as the truth (John 17:14-21). This oneness is ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God (John 17:22-24). Such a oneness was imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ, in their regeneration by the Spirit of life with Christ as the divine life; this oneness has become the basic element of the church ground.</P>
