   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We already know that God's leadings are not always "direct"; rather, some are "indirect."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His direct leading, God's Spirit moves in our spirit so that we may know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We only need to pay attention to the motion in our spirit to know the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, of all that we should do in our lifetime, not everything will be directly told to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are many needs which we see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What should we do concerning them?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, we may be invited to a place to work, or something else may suddenly happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not initiated directly from the spirit, but it reaches us through others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our mind may realize the importance of solving this matter, but our spirit may not be responsive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What should we do to obtain God's leading?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After something happens, we should ask God to lead us in the spirit; this is called indirect leading.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the time for the mind to assist the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When there is no stirring in his spirit, a believer should use his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the spirit continuously uttered its intention, it would not be necessary for the mind to assist the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since, however, the spirit is sometimes silent, the mind has to fill the position of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At such a time, the believer should use his mind to consider and ponder his doubts and difficulties before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although his prayer, consideration, and pondering all issue from his mind, after a while, the believer will see that his spirit also joins into his prayer, consideration, and pondering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he senses the spirit, which was previously silent, the Holy Spirit will lead him in the spirit before too long.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way we can use our mind to assist the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not think that something should not be done because the spirit does not move; rather, we should "draw up" our spirit with our mind to make it alive, and let it resolve whether the matter is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SPIRIT'S ACTIVITIES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our spiritual life there are many things that should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, the work of the mind cannot be neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being filled in our spirit is different from the ocean tide coming in and going out at will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be filled in the spirit, we must fulfill its requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This implies that the mind must initiate what the spirit is ready to do but has not yet begun.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we sit and wait for the sense of the spirit, it will never come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Neither should we overemphasize the work of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should know that only the activities that are done in the spirit have spiritual value; therefore, we should not walk according to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then why do we use the mind?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We use the mind, but it is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, our purpose is to stir up the spirit to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spirit must be the one who works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the spirt is still very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Employing the mind is simply for stirring up the work of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, when we apply the mind to draw up the spirit, if there is neither a response nor an experience of the anointing after a period of time, the work of the mind in that regard should cease and turn in another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In spiritual warfare as well, if we have a sense of "void" within us for a long period and no sense of the spirit, we should stop; however, we should not stop simply because of the impatience of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although sometimes we are weary, we know that we should continue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At other times we know that we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no fixed law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the mind to assist the spirit in this way is like priming a mechanical pump.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some pumps require a cup of water to be poured in first in order to create some suction power which draws the water up as we are pumping.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The relationship of our mind to the spirit is the same as the cup of water to the pump.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not use a cup of water as a starter, water cannot be drawn up; similarly, if we do not initiate with our mind, the spirit will not rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not use the mind to initiate prayer, it is like a person who does not pour in a cup of water, and after pumping a couple of times, says that there is no water in the well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Truly there are differences in the work of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes it is as strong as a lion, and sometimes it is as indecisive as a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When our spirit is weak and cannot help itself, the mind should act as the spirit's nursing mother to look after it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The mind cannot replace the spirit, but it can assist the spirit to enliven it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the spirit descends from its controlling position, the believer should use the power of the mind to pray and raise it up again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Should the spirit sink because of oppression, the believer should use his mind to examine the condition and then pray strongly until the spirit rises up to be liberated again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A spiritual mind can maintain the tranquil position of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The mind can restrict excessive activities of the spirit and also uplift an excessively depressed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Simply speaking, our spirit can only be filled again by the activities of our mind in the spiritual realm .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle, whatever we have done in the spirit, we should now do with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then when the Holy Spirit anoints us, it confirms that we are doing it in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the beginning of a certain situation, you may not have any sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, once you acquire the sense of the spirit, this indicates that the spirit wanted to work this way, but it was too weak to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through the assistance of the mind, it is able to express what it previously was unable to express.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever we need in the spirit can be obtained by simply considering in our mind and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way we will be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Regarding assisting the spirit, another point must be observed: spiritual warfare involves spirit warring with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When our spirit wrestles with the evil spirit, the strength of our entire being is one with the spirit for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The most important part is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The entire strength of the spirit and the mind must be united together for the attack.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the spirit becomes suppressed and loses its strength to resist, the mind should continually fight for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the mind fights by praying, resisting, and opposing, the spirit will receive a supply to rise up once again for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>THE CONDITION OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because the mind can assist the spirit, even though its position is much lower than the spirit, a believer must keep his mind in a normal condition to enable it to search the interpretation of the spirit and assist in any weakness of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The activities of the spirit are governed by their laws.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Likewise, the activities of the mind are governed by their particular laws.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the mind is free to work, the burden is light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Should it become stretched like one stretches a sling , it cannot work freely.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The enemy knows that we need the mind to assist the spirit in order to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, he always presses us, keeping our mind excessively stretched and unable to function normally in order that it will not be able to assist the spirit when it is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Moreover, our mind is not simply an organ to assist the spirit; we also obtain light through it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Holy Spirit of God gives light to the mind through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the mind is exercised excessively, there is no possibility for it to receive light from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The evil spirit knows that if our mind is in darkness, our whole being will also be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, it endeavors to cause us to think excessively so that we cannot be quieted to work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As a believer walks according to the spirit, he must prohibit his mind from continually turning.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Concentrating on one theme, anxiety, sorrow, or overly considering what the will of God is, makes the mind unable to bear the burden and work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only by maintaining a quiet and peaceful mind can one walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since the mind occupies such an important position, when working with others, a believer must be cautious not to interrupt the thoughts of his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Breaking a train of thought can cause the mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When the Holy Spirit leads a believer to consider a matter through the spirit, an interruption by others is a very fearful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If a thought is interrupted, the mind will be stretched, and consequently, it is harder to work with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Hence, not only should we keep our mind free, we should also take care of the mind of our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before speaking to a brother, we should first check the trend of his thought and then speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Otherwise, we will cause him to suffer.</S>
