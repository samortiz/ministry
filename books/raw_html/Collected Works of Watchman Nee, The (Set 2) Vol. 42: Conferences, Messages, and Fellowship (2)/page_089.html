<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY</h1><h1 class="title">TAKING UP OUR CROSS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 22, 1936, evening<br />Place: Foochow<br />Scripture Reading: Luke 9:23-24; Phil. 3:10</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S OBJECTIVE SALVATION AND<br />SUBJECTIVE SALVATION</h2><p>God's intention in creating man was not only for man to multiply and replenish the earth, but for God to have sons, that is, for Him to have a group of men who would have His life. This group of men would not only have God's image outwardly, but also have His life inwardly. In the garden of Eden, God intended only to do one thing, which was for Adam to receive His life. If Adam had done this, God's goal would have been achieved. After Adam fell, God had to do two things. First, He had to deal with sin, and second, He had to deal with man the person. God dealt with sin so that man would no longer be a sinner. He dealt with man so that man would no longer merely be man. Both as a man and a sinner, man needs God's grace. A sinner needs God's grace in order to have the forgiveness of sins, and a man needs God's grace in order that he may receive God's life. The Adam in paradise needed God's grace, and the Adam outside of paradise also needed God's grace. In the first few evenings, we saw that on the objective side, God solves the problems of the sinner and man by the substitutionary work of the blood and the identifying work of the cross. In the next few evenings, we saw that on the subjective side, God deals with man's problem in life through Christ's flesh becoming our life. The result is that man can now live out the life of Christ.</p><p>God has prepared not only an objective salvation for us, but also a subjective salvation. The blood of the Passover signifies the objective redemption, whereas the lamb of the Passover signifies the subjective salvation. All of the Israelites, old and young, had to strike the blood and eat the lamb. This simple type shows us objective salvation as well as subjective salvation. By striking the blood, we receive objective salvation. By eating the Lord's flesh, our natural elements are eliminated daily, and the Lord lives out of us day by day. This is subjective salvation. Tonight we have to add another item, which is bearing the cross. We can explain this by a diagram:</p><p>I wonder how many of you realize the preciousness of this diagram. If there was a meeting concerning this diagram and I had to buy a ticket to get in, I would pay a hundred pounds to get in. Let us look carefully at this diagram.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BLOOD OF CHRIST AND THE CROSS OF CHRIST<br />DEALING WITH SIN AND THE OLD MAN</h2><p>First let us consider the sinner. There are two aspects to the sinner. The first is sin and the second is the old man. Sin is like the product of a factory, whereas the old man is like the factory. Because the old man is corrupt, the product is nothing but sin; one cannot expect any better product than sin. The Lord's blood deals with the product, that is, it deals with man's sin. It cleanses us of our sins and accomplishes an eternal redemption. There are two aspects to cleansing us of our sins. The first is cleansing before God, and the second is cleansing in man. The first aspect removes the record of sin before God and brings in forgiveness. The second aspect removes the guilt in man's conscience. The blood does not cleanse man's heart; it only cleanses man's conscience. Since the Lord has shed His blood on the cross and sin has been judged, God must forgive man's sin. This is most righteous. Man no longer has to worry or be threatened by his sins; he can now enjoy peace. In the Old Testament, after a leper was cleansed, the priests had to sprinkle the holy place seven times and sprinkle the leper seven times (Lev. 14:19; 4:6; 14:7). This signifies that man is at peace when sin is forgiven before God.</p><p>However, the blood cannot cleanse our old man, self, or lusts. There is no place in the Bible that says the blood cleanses our old man. The old man must be crucified and annihilated. There is no way to deal with the old man except through death. Even God cannot do anything with it. The old man can only be dealt with by the cross. Hence, the cross of Christ deals with our old man. The sinner's sins are dealt with by the blood, whereas the sinner's old man is dealt with by the cross. The blood signifies the substitutionary death of Christ; He bore God's judgment on the sinner's behalf to secure the forgiveness of sin for us. The cross signifies the identifying death of Christ; our old man was crucified together with Christ and has been terminated.</p>
