   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thessalonica, like Philippi, was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Macedonian call, which Paul received on his second journey of ministry, he and his co-worker Silvanus visited first Philippi and then Thessalonica Acts 16:9-12; 17:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle stayed and worked there for only a short time, probably less than one month Acts 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Thessalonians 1:1 says, "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.''</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, it is of men such as the Thessalonians , yet in God and in the Lord organically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>H. Spreading to the Province of Achaia, next to Macedonia Churches Raised Up in: 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Corinth the Church in Corinth</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The planting of the churches also spread to the province of Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Achaia was south of Macedonia and was a province of the Roman Empire, a great part of today's Greece, in which is the city of Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 2 Corinthians 1:1 Paul addresses "the church of God which is in Corinth.''</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expression "the church of God'' is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It indicates that the church in Corinth was not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, nor of any practice or doctrine, but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church was constituted of the universal God, but it existed in Corinth, a definite locality on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In nature the church is universal in God, but in practice the church is local in a definite place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cenchrea the Church in Cenchrea, with a Deaconess</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 16:1 Paul says, "I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Phoebe was a deaconess, that is, a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul held her in such high esteem that in the following verse he said that "she has been a patroness of many and of myself as well.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "patroness'' in Greek is a word of dignity, denoting one who helps, sustains, and supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Phoebe was a sister who served others at any price and at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we mean business with the Lord in the church life, we also need to serve the church and care for it regardless of the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first requirement for the practice of the church life is that we serve the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I. Spreading to Italy 1.</S>
