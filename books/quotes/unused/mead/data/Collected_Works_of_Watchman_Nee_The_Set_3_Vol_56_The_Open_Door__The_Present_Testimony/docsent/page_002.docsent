   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OPEN DOOR ISSUE NO.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>23 March 1, 1951 THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A RECORD OF A FELLOWSHIP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would like to speak to the brothers a little more concerning the problem of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church must have both the authority of the Spirit and the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ground of locality, however, is not a simple matter, because a church still needs content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without content, it still cannot be regarded as a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being correct in name is a very important matter, but being correct in name does not necessarily mean that there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason I would like to see from the Bible, together with you, several requirements of a church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just saying that we are standing on the ground of locality is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to say that a church is standing on the ground of locality, it should fulfill certain requirements and conditions and should have a certain content.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If none of these requirements and conditions are met, we are still not standing on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Receptive</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, if a church is really standing on the ground of locality as set forth in the Bible, she must receive all whom the Lord has received.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 15:7 says, "Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see one thing: The receiving of a Christian is based upon the receiving of Christ that is, we should receive one another as Christ has received us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, we cannot refuse those whom Christ has received.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a sinner has been received by Christ, we must receive him as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not receive a man whom Christ has received, immediately we are a sect, not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is a church?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A church receives all whom Christ has received in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is not as concerned with those who live in Shanghai receiving the brothers in Nanking or Chungking as He is about them receiving the brothers in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must receive all whom Christ has received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we want to determine whether or not the church in Tientsin is a church, all we have to do is see whether or not it receives all those who are saved in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose the brothers in Tientsin want to be selective; they only want to receive a certain type of people who have been received by Christ and not another type of people who also have been received by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then that is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot say that we receive those who are the same as us, while we do not receive those who are not the same as us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot fail to receive one whom the Lord has received for any reason; otherwise, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Him who is weak in faith receive,..for God has received him" Rom 14:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose someone is a vegetarian.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may consider that he is very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the basis for receiving is whether or not God has received him, not whether he is strong or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps he is a weak brother, but we still must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God already has received him without regard for his strength or weakness; therefore, we must receive him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fundamental fellowship of a church in a locality is based upon the fellowship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must receive a brother whom God has received.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot have any reason to refuse him; otherwise, we are a sect, not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church in a locality is based on a receiving that is as broad as God and also as strict as God: Whomever God receives, we receive; whomever God does not receive, we do not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The universal church receives all whom God has received in the whole world; a local church receives all whom God has received in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No matter how different a brother is from us or how far short he is of our standard, there is only one requirement for us to receive him that is, has God received him?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If God has received him, we must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, a local church we must be very clear about this must take the life of Christ and faith in God as the basis for receiving believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Apart from this we do not have any other demands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we make other demands as certain requirements, we are a sect just like any other sect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A sect is condemned and is therefore a very serious matter.</S>
