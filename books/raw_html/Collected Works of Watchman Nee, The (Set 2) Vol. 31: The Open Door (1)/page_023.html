<h2 class="head2">Recent News of Sister Ma Min-jen,<br />Kuling, Jiu-Jiang</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>My illness has improved. The "air-pressurization" did me some good, and no bacteria was found in the sputum during the last examination. Perhaps the "air-pressurization" had killed the germs. The present world situation forces us to cry to the Lord to come quickly. I will write again. Please give my greetings to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Sister Min-jen<br />November 19<br />(Sister Ma moved from the mountain in January and into Ren-Ji Hospital in Yi-Chang for convalescent care&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Three Letters from Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Tonight, Brother Han Fu-sheng with his children and amah, Brother Zhang Gung-jih and his family, Dr. and Mrs. Qu of Jiu-Jiang and their family, Mrs. Hu and my wife, and one sister from the Wei household left for Ch'ang-Teh on a steamer. They will wait for Brother Suen to take them to Chi-Li. If the situation becomes critical, Brother Chu and his family will move to the village to take refuge for a while. Brother Luk and his family have returned to Hong Kong. Mrs. Wu intends to go to Yunnan or to Hong Kong. Sisters Wang Juh-ching and Hsu En-shiu have left for Ch'ang-sha, where they will wait for a train to go to Yunnan. Sister Chang Yueh-hwa, her mother, and Sister Chen Mei-buo will leave on the Min-Chuen steamer for Yi-Chang, where they will change boats to Hankow. Most of the brothers and sisters in Hankow have left. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang, Mrs. Yuen, and Brother Chang.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />December 16</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your airmail letter sent from Yi-Chang. Mr. Nee had a hard time trying to get his train ticket and did not leave until the eighteenth. Sister Wang Juh-ching went to K'un-ming with Sister En-shiu's family. They are now in Ch'ang-sha. According to a letter from Sister Hsu, Sister Juh-ching went to Yunnan on the twenty-sixth. My whole family is waiting for a train to go to Kweilin. Mrs. Luh Yu-tang has gone to Hong Kong on a British battleship. Brother Yang and senior Mrs. Yang will also go also to Hong Kong by bus. Brother Liu Kwo-hwa will move to Chungking with the pharmaceutical factory tomorrow. Sister Bi-kuen will fly to Hong Kong with a patient of hers. Most of the brothers and sisters in Hankow, both the visitors and the local ones, have left. Presently, Brother Zhang is still here; Brothers Chou You-seng, Ju Ju-yao, Hu Lan-seng, and myself are also here. The Open Door can be mailed out completely by tomorrow. The post office will no longer accept anything printed in Shanghai or Kiangsu. Mr. Nee has taken two thousand copies with him and is mailing them to the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other war-zones. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />December<br />P.S. Sister Chien Sin-sian is still in Hankow.</p>
