   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO PLACE FOR OUR CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In God's economy there is no place for religion, or ethical behavior, or human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's concern is only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wants Christ expressed in us, not human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the thought of living by Christ does not have much meaning for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have no idea, or very little idea, of what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider these verses in John 16 about the Holy Spirit: "And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment; Concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Holy Spirit will convict the world concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How sinful the world is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is robbery, murder, and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely the world will be convicted for this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But, no!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord said the conviction for sin is "because they do not believe in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament economy the first commandment given by God is that we believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To break this commandment is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who perish do so, not because of committing robbery or fornication, but because of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The universe is God's, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the Administrator.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To disobey His commandment that we believe in His Son is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether we are a gentleman or a bank robber, God's commandment is that we believe in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Moses' time there were Ten Commandments, but now there is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To refuse to believe in the Son is the sin for which mankind will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Jewish people think they are worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do their best to live by the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But they do not know that in the New Testament economy, God has given a new, different commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because they will not believe in Christ, they are guilty of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we are saved, God gives us another commandment: walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But instead of heeding this basic commandment, we pay attention to the exhortations that suit our natural mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We try to love our wives or submit to our husbands, but exhortations like these are not basic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are not saved, God's commandment is that we believe in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once we are saved, He commands that we walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can all experience that by our believing in the Lord Jesus we inherit all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Holiness, victory, spirituality, and every spiritual blessing become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not seek spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To seek anything other than Him is to miss God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul wrote to the Galatians because they had been distracted from Christ by the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He wrote to the Colossians because they had been distracted from Christ by Gnosticism, including Jewish and heathen philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>CHRIST A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is presented to the Colossians as a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Colossians 1:27 it refers to "this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A mystery is a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the secret of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Strange as it may sound, the gospel is not merely for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The gospel is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is its center and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we receive the gospel, we of course participate in God's salvation, but that is only an issue; it is not basic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ Himself is what is basic to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Colossians 2:2 Christ is called the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God Himself is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is the mystery of this mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the secret of this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then in verses 16 and 17 Paul goes on to point out how the Colossians have been influenced by the Judaizers in their eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these things whether daily, yearly, monthly, or weekly "are a shadow of things to come."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The light may cause a table, for example, to cast a shadow, but that shadow is not the body of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul says that their practices under the Levitical law are all shadows, "but the body is of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How sad for the Colossians to miss the body and care for shadows!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other words, Christ is the real food, the real drink, the real Sabbath, the real new moon, and the real feast.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the reality of everything positive.</S>
