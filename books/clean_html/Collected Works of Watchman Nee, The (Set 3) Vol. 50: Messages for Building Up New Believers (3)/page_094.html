<h2 class="head3">2. The System of Bishops</h2><p>At first, the bishops, or overseers, were the elders, and they were always plural in number. Later, a bishop from among the elders was appointed. Still later, the bishops began to oversee not only the church in their own locality but churches in several localities. The elders, however, continued to oversee one local church. As a result, the elders and the overseers became two separate classes! Originally, the overseers and the elders were one and the same group of people, but later, an elder was chosen from among all the elders to be a bishop. One elder bore the title of bishop, while the rest remained as elders but were no longer called overseers. The bishop was considered to be an elder of the elders; he presided over the other elders and ruled over the church in that locality. Still later, these bishops expanded their authority and began to cover other localities. Gradually, the condition of the church changed. The bishop of the capital of a province would rule over that entire province, and the bishop of the capital of a nation would rule over the churches of the entire nation. The bishop of Rome naturally ruled over all the churches in the entire Roman Empire. As a result, the church became something very big!</p><p>Originally, the church was a mustard seed, something very small. But then she became a big tree. Now we find something strange on the earth&mdash;united churches. These are institutions organized by men. The Bible shows us that God's intended union of earthly churches is a union of the Body. The fellowship of the churches on earth is the fellowship of the Body. But what do we see today? Men have cast aside this spiritual fellowship and spiritual union. The fellowship of the Body is spiritual, and the union of the Body is spiritual. Today, however, men replace this spiritual union with organizational unions. Beginning from the second century, the church gradually degenerated into a confederation of churches.</p><p>When Constantine accepted Christianity, he saw a church which by then had already become the Roman Catholic Church, a church welcomed by men. That church had become full grown; it was a tree. It was no longer made up of individual churches. It had become a united tree. When the Roman Empire accepted Christianity, many birds came and nested in its branches!</p><h2 class="head3">3. Satan Bringing Defilement into the Church</h2><p>The birds in the second parable signify the principalities in the air. In the first parable, the Lord Jesus said that the seeds were snatched away by birds, and then He explained that it was the evil one who came to snatch away the seeds that were sown. Birds in this chapter refer to Satan and his evil principalities. This means that Satan is responsible for bringing many defiled things into the church.</p><p>Now the church has become a mammoth organization. However, this greatness is a false greatness; it is a deformed greatness. Originally, the church was despised by men. Now she has become a political asset in the hands of ambitious people. The church is full of people, and in politics the more people there are, the more it is an asset. Now every kind of defiled thing has crept into the church. The birds of heaven came and nested in its branches. The condition is like that of Pergamos&mdash;the church has become united with and married to the world. Today the church has become a big and worldly organization, and all kinds of people have come into it.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Body of Christ Becoming Large</h2><p>This tree includes the genuine church, but it also includes many things that should not be there. The seed is still a mustard seed. The trouble with it is that it has grown too big. This excessive greatness is manmade. The seed that was sown by the Lord is still there. On the one hand, the church has deviated. On the other hand, we have to admit that the Lord's church was still hidden within such a church. The only trouble is that something more has been added to it. It is no longer simply the Lord's church, but something greater. The world has crept in everywhere, and the church has become large. The mustard seed has grown into a big tree.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Woman Exercising Her Authority</h2><p>The One who sowed the seed was the Lord Himself. The woman represents the church. In the Bible women always represent the church. The position of the church in the Bible is that of the wife of Christ. Christ loved the church even as a husband loves his wife. Just as God made Eve out of the rib of Adam, Christ produced the church by His life. In the Bible the church is always represented by women. In the future, the church will be the wife of the Lamb. A man, not a woman, sows the seed. In other words, only Christ can sow the seed; the church cannot do this. The church cannot make any decision for herself. It does not have any authority of its own.</p><p>Yet one day the church on earth became like a tree whose roots were deep and whose branches were numerous. The church became worldly and powerful. All sorts of evil powers came into the church and took shelter there. Because Caesar was in the church, the woman became great and assumed much authority.</p>
