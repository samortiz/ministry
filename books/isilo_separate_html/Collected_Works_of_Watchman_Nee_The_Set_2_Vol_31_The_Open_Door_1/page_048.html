He is from Hankow&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>(1) There is one matter to report that requires prayer in one accord. Since I left the orphanage in Hankow, the management was handed over to the X denomination. Not long ago the chief administrators of the denomination mentioned to Brother Yu Shiang-shan that they wanted to close down. However, most of the students in the school do not have homes to return to. Brother Yu was wondering what to do when he heard that the founder of the school, Mr. Lee Ju-shen (the manager of Liu-Ho-Gou Steel Foundry), had come to Hankow. Brother Yu wrote a letter to him and made an appointment to see him. Mr. Lee definitely did not want to allow the orphanage to be closed. If the denomination did not want to run it, he asked Mr. Yu to work out the details for dissolving the partnership with the denomination and then manage it himself. Mr. Lee would be responsible for all of the costs. He also asked Brother Yu to ask me to come back and run the school. Mr. Lee then gave Brother Yu some money on the spot and told him to save X dollars for use after the denomination stopped managing the place. He also said that the daily costs could be sent to him by mail and he would wire the money back. Brother Yu told me this last night and asked me to take the job. (Of course, this would be after all the rice in the school has been eaten and the denomination leaves.) I listened to him and only promised to pray about this matter. I really feel that God must initiate this matter. When God calls people, He bears the full responsibility and it is enough. I was personally called to this occupation, but I want to wait for God Himself to move. I only want to walk in God's way without going off. I am telling you this to ask for your prayers and any advice you can give me.</p><p>(2) Brother Chen Hsi-wen went to Ch'ang-sha on December 29. He really saw the Lord's marvelous arrangement and full provisions in the matter of buying his tickets.</p><p>(3) Brother Zhang Ji-wu left Hankow for Ch'ang-sha on January 2. He sent a letter from Ch'ang-sha on January 17 saying that he was planning to go to Kuei-yang sometime around the twentieth.</p><p>(4) Sister Ma Min-jen and a Sister Yao arrived safely in Hankow on January 3. On January 13 Mr. Luan sent a letter to Sister Ma Min-jen exhorting them to go to Hong Kong. She prayed about it and felt that she should go to Hong Kong and that I should accompany them. If I did not accompany them there, I would still have to go to Hong Kong for a very important mission. I plan to meet for a long talk with Mr. Lee Ju-shen concerning what to do with the orphanage. Then I will know how to make arrangements for these children when I return. Brother Yu also approves of my going to personally meet and discuss the practical matters with Mr. Lee. However, I am praying earnestly to see how God would lead me in this matter. Please pray earnestly for this. "This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction" (James 1:27). This word is always in my heart. Sister Ma is waiting for a sleeper seat on the train. Whenever she is ready, we will set out. Please do not worry. But I do hope you will pray for us.</p><p>(5) Brother Wang Sin-sheng (Sister Wang's uncle) came to a meeting on January 3 and said that his wife had arrived safely in Yi-Yang. Brother Sin-sheng has found a job. They now live in the meeting hall.</p><p>(6) Brother Han Fu-sheng and Brother Zhang Gung-jih are both well in Ch'ang-Teh and Yuan-Jiang. Brother Zhang may still be able to find some work. (This needs prayer.)</p><p>(7) Brother Li Tsan-ting found a job in the Wu-ch'ang County government with the help of Mr. X. He has moved from the countryside to Hankow to work in the provincial capitol.</p><p>(8) The condition of the assembly in Hankow is very good. Although the brothers and sisters that were once here have all scattered, many new brothers and sisters have come.</p><p>(9) Brother Liu Chu-fei, Sister Liu Mei-jen, and Sister Liu Yu-jen left Hankow for Ch'ang-sha.</p><p>(10) Sister Wu's desire to leave Hankow has already cooled off. She is probably not going to go to Hong Kong in the near future.</p><p>(11) A Sister Chang Kuo Ji-jen has recently attended the Lord's Day meetings. Last week she came to remember the Lord with us. She mentioned that she knew Sister Wang. Brother Wang Ching-shan introduced his cousin's wife to us. She is also a good sister.</p><p>(12) Many of the brothers and sisters who lost their jobs in Hankow have now found work. Praise the Lord! He willingly inclines His ear to our prayer! He remembers His people!</p><p>(13) On the morning of January 22, Missionary Jieh came here from Chu-Wo in Shansi. She said that she would be going home by way of Hong Kong. She asked me about the time of the meetings, and tomorrow evening she will come to the table meeting. In Hankow she stays at the China Inland Mission Workers' House.</p><p>(The following are excerpts from Shanghai's Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's last two letters&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>(14) San-Chiao-Bu cannot receive letters directly. A person who came to Shanghai from that area said that Brother Chou Hsin-yih, Brother Tang Shou-ling, and their families were all in a place near there called Yah-Dan-Ou. They were all doing well.</p><p>(15) Brother Luh Tze-ming plans to move to Hankow because the Shanghai Youth Book Store has closed. He is still in Shanghai.</p><p>(16) The Christian will not be published for awhile. It is too difficult to send out because the subscribers have moved around too much.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
