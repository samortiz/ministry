<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FEW MATTERS CONCERNING THE CONFERENCE</H2><P>Because many friends from distant places do not have friends or family in Shanghai to stay with and our place is not the most spacious, there are many things that are lacking. If there is any lack in our hospitality, I ask you ahead of time to forgive us!</P><P>With regard to the price of meals, we do not set a price, nor do we determine not to accept money. We only ask for voluntary help according to the ability of the brothers and sisters attending the conference and the Lord's leading. In this way, he who has much will have no surplus, and the poor will have no lack.</P><P>Any brother or sister coming to the conference should please pay attention to the following points:</P>	<ol class="decimal">	<li>We hope that whoever is not clear that he is saved or is saved but does not seek the Lord with hunger and thirst will not come. The nature of our conference is not for the unsaved, nor is it for the undesiring. Please pay attention to this point.</li>	<li>You must bring your bedding with you (you will need two blankets because Shanghai is very cold), towels, and any other personal thing you must use every day.</li>	<li>You must take care of your own traveling expenses.</li>	<li>The dates of the conference are from January 22 to February 1, 1934.
