<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE BEING CHRIST, THE SPIRIT,<br />
AND THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>We have seen that the Spirit is the realization of Christ and that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. We have also seen that when the Triune God moves, He is the Spirit. Just as the current of electricity is electricity in motion, the Spirit of God is God moving. As the Spirit He moves into us, He stays in us, and He lives in us. When He lives in us, He becomes the divine life. The divine life is simply God Himself living in us.</p>
<p>When God is embodied, He is Christ. When God moves, He is the Spirit. When God lives in us, He is the divine life. These are three factors vital to the church life: Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life. The church life is simply Christ, plus the Spirit, plus the divine life. Christ is God embodied, the Spirit is God moving, and the divine life is God living in us.</p>
<p>I hope that all of you, especially the young people, will speak all these things again and again until you can speak them in your dreams. Speak of the three factors vital to the church life: Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life. Christ is God embodied, the Spirit is God moving, and the divine life is God living in us. This is the church life! The church is not something organized, not merely a human society. The church is Christ, the church is the Spirit, and the church is the divine life. What is Christ? Christ is God embodied. What is the Spirit? The Spirit is God moving. What is the divine life? The divine life is God living in us. We all must have this dream, the dream of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DAILY SALVATION BY THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>We all must see that the divine life is the Triune God living in the believers. You have been regenerated with this divine life, and now this divine life is saving you with a daily salvation (Rom. 5:10). This divine life saves you from your bad temper, from anger, from worry, and from anxiety. It even saves you from murmuring. In the family life there is always murmuring. Husbands may murmur about their wives, and wives may murmur about their husbands. A husband may say that he does not always love his wife because sometimes she is not so lovable. This is murmuring. A sister may say that she does not always submit to her husband because sometimes he is not a proper head. This is also murmuring. In the church life the saints sometimes murmur about the elders. All this shows how much you need a daily salvation. If God lives in you in reality, this living of God will save you from murmuring. Then to you your husband or your wife will be wonderful, and all the elders will be wonderful. We all need this kind of salvation.</p>
<p>To be saved in life as mentioned in Romans 5:10 is not to be saved from perdition, from hell, but to be saved from our daily &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; Perhaps this morning or this afternoon a sister was in &ldquo;hell&rdquo; for three hours because her husband offended her. Then she came to a meeting, heard the message, and became happy. In a sense, this meeting saved her from her hell. However, I expect that every day you will be saved by God living in you. Do not forget that God living in you is the divine life. In Romans 5:10 Paul says that we shall be saved in His life. Salvation in this verse does not refer to salvation from eternal perdition. To be saved in His life means to be saved from daily failures, from daily weaknesses. This is the life that we are enjoying today.</p>
<p>In the millennium, the faithful believers will reign in life as kings ruling over all things (Rev. 20:6). However, even today we can be kings ruling over our anxiety, over our anger, over our bad habits, over our bad temper, and over murmuring (Rom. 5:17). We can be kings in our daily life and in our church life. We can be kings in our offices. The sisters who teach school can be kings in their schools, kings ruling in life. This is the divine life.</p>
