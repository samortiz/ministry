   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EPHESIANS 4:4-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4:4 reveals that there is one Spirit for one Body with one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without Paul's prayer in Ephesians 3, there would be no way for the believers to be one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the believers' inward parts have been taken over, occupied, by the settling Christ, the Spirit can be the very essence of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church as the Body of Christ has the Spirit as its essence with a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The hope is that the entire Body of Christ will be fully transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today much of our being still remains in the old creation, but we have a hope that one day the Lord will transfigure even our physical body into His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the Spirit is the Body's essence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit as the essence of the Body needs to saturate our entire being until we are transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have a hope for this transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 4:5 speaks of one Lord the Son with one faith and one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Faith united us to Christ in the organic union, and baptism cut us off, separated us, from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, faith joins and baptism cuts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we are of the Lord because we have faith and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 6 says that there is one God and Father of all over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to be those who are enjoying the Father as the source of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This One is in three directions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the Father is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the Father is over all, the Son is through all, and the Spirit is in all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that the Triune God is embodied in the Father who is also over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EPHESIANS 5:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 5:19 and 20 also show the Divine Trinity in the divine move and in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, there is speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs songs of the Spirit in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "spiritual" shows that all the songs are spiritual poems of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the Spirit is the very essence of our psalms, hymns, and songs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The worldly poetry is of another kind of essence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we sing our psalms, our hymns, and our songs, we have the deep feeling that we are touching another essence, and this essence is the very Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 19b says that we should be singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord the Son .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are of the Spirit, but we sing them to the Lord, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we need to be those giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father v. 20 . We sing with the essence of the Spirit to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we give thanks to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All Three of the Godhead are covered in Ephesians 5:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we speak the psalms, the hymns, and the songs, we are speaking something of the essence of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we render our singing, our psalming to the Son, and we thank our Father in the name of the Son with the essence of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, very few Christians realize that whenever we sing or speak a hymn, we are enjoying the Three of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We enjoy the essence of the Spirit, we enjoy the Lord as our goal, and we enjoy the Father as our object.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We thank the Father, and we sing songs to the Son with something of the essence of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way in which we enjoy the Triune God.</S>
