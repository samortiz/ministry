   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONLY CRITERIA FOR RECEIVING SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HEART TOUCHING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 7:36-50 speaks of a sinful woman being forgiven of her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was full of gratitude to the Lord for the forgiveness she received.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She realized that the multitude of her sins had not stopped the Lord from forgiving her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This led her to appreciate the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She was not conscious of any condition for believing; she simply felt the Lord's compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She touched the Lord with her heart, and she was full of gratitude for His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was all she did to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believing simply means touching the Lord with the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In preaching the gospel, our emphasis should not be on how much men understand salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as they touch the Lord once, their sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The woman was forgiven of all her sins because she loved much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once she exercised her love to touch the Lord, she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Luke 18:13-14 the Lord said, "But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here was a man who was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not have to make any so-called commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not have any spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He only felt that he was a sinner and prayed for God to be propitiated to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was all he did to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a man comes to God, we do not have to worry if he understands the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as his heart turns to God, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, we do not have to pay too much attention to what we preach concerning God's accomplishments for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All we need to do is to make the sinners feel that they have sinned and make them come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 15 speaks of the parable of the return of the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was able to return home because he came to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is all that was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the prodigal son came to himself and decided to turn back to his father and confess his sin, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In saving men, we do not have to make them understand too much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is enough to have a sincere heart to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can help them understand the truth of the gospel later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Luke 19:1-10 is the story of Zaccheus's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His "seeing" was similar to the "touching" of the woman with the issue of blood Mark 5:25-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people pressed against the Lord, but He did not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as the woman with the issue of blood touched Him, however, He felt something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The look of Zaccheus was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once he looked, the Lord's attention was drawn towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our Lord does not save anyone who does not care to be saved; He saves only those who are eager to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not save the pressing ones; He only saves the touching ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not save the noise-loving crowd; He only saves those who have come purposely to look for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Zaccheus was saved because he was intent on seeing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His penetrating concern earned him the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once a man's heart stretches out, the Lord's attention is drawn to it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Luke 23:39-43 we find the two thieves being crucified with the Lord mocking Him at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before one of them died, however, he suddenly had a change of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said to the Lord, "Remember me when You come into Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His heart was stirred up to touch the Lord, and his whole being was drawn forward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although his words missed the mark, the Lord knew his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord was not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He answered him, saying, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as the thief's heart was stirred up, the Lord saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His salvation was not dependent on the amount of doctrine he knew.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In John 4:1-10 the Lord preached the gospel to the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did not explain the truth of the gospel to her in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He did not tell her how He was going to die for her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He only said, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord's word shows that God is willing to grant men salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as a sinner says in his heart, "This is the Savior that I need," he will be saved immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to follow our Lord's example.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The most economical way to preach the gospel is to save the most number of men with the least amount of teaching.</S>
