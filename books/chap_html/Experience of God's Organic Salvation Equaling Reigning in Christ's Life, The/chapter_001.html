It is not easy to speak such messages, but each message has an outline that can help us enter into the content of the message. Therefore, today I am not speaking to you in the way of delivering a message. Rather, I will speak item by item according to the message outline. I hope that you will try your best to follow me in each point. Every item mentioned in these outlines is a development, and the ultimate issue of this development is the New Jerusalem, which is an indescribable constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man. Never consider that the New Jerusalem is a physical city. The New Jerusalem is an indescribable constitution of God and man. As such, it can be understood only according to the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and it cannot be expressed with human words.</p>
