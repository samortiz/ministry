The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, that is, to bring them into His expression.<p>Romans 8:29 and 30 tell us that God&#8217;s work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, continued through His predestination, calling, and justification, and will end with His glorification. This will be accomplished by the Lord&#8217;s coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we shall appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God&#8217;s salvation, will be manifested in fullness in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23).<p>Through regeneration the life of glory was dispensed into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us. This seed, this life of glory, is Christ in us, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). Eventually, this seed will blossom, and thereby we shall be brought into glory. Actually, the glory into which God is leading us is the glory which He has already given us (John 17:22). Although glory has been given to us already, it is still necessary for God to bring us into it.<p>God&#8217;s leading the believers as His many sons into glory will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing. This means that the dispensing of the Triune God will consummate in our being brought into God&#8217;s glory. If we see this, we shall depend not on teaching but on God&#8217;s dispensing. Mere teaching cannot bring us into God&#8217;s glory. It is only by the divine dispensing that we shall be constituted into God&#8217;s inheritance and eventually brought into His glory. This dispensing will cause the seed of glory within us to grow until it blossoms. The blossoming of the seed of glory will be our glorification. Hence, the divine dispensing will cause us to be glorified. May we all see that our loving Father is dispensing Himself into us and that through His dispensing He is bringing us into His glory.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
