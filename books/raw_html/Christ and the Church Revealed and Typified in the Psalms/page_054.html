<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAY OF RESTORATION— EXALTING CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 77 to 83</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 77:7-13; 78:65-66, 68-69; 79:1; 80:14-15, 17-19; 82:8; 83:2-5, 12, 18</h1><p>In Psalms 77 to 83 we are further impressed with the reason for the desolation of God’s house and the way of recovery. After the desolation, God’s dwelling place can only be restored by His people giving the pre-eminence to Christ. When Christ is given His rightful position, God will be able to take possession of the earth through the local churches.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 77—GOD’S WAY IS IN THE SANCTUARY</h2><p>In Psalm 77, the saints, in the experience of troubles, realize that God’s way is in the sanctuary. In verses 1 to 9, the saints are perplexed by their troubles. The Psalmist asks, “Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?” (vv. 7-8). Then he says, “This is my infirmity” (v. 10). To say that the Lord has given us up is our infirmity. “But I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old” (vv. 10-11). He still remembers what the Lord did in the past. “I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings” (v. 12). Do not look only at the present situation; we must remember what the Lord has done in the past. Verse 13: “Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?” By remembering what the Lord has done in the past and by fellowshipping one with another concerning all He has accomplished, the saints realize that the way of God is in His sanctuary; thus, God’s greatness is also realized by them. The way of all the Lord does is in the sanctuary. It is holy and mysterious. You cannot separate His doings from His sanctuary. Since His doings are mysterious, we must get into the heart, the very center of all the situations to understand them. The heart and the center of all the situations is the sanctuary of God. Do not be troubled by the present; remember what the Lord has done in the past and learn the Lord’s way—it is in the sanctuary of God, in God’s dwelling place. If you would find the solution, you must forever come into the sanctuary of God. In Psalm 73, the Psalmist received revelation in the sanctuary; in Psalm 77, he finds the answer also in the sanctuary. Verses 16 to 20 also tell us that God’s way “is in the sea, in the great waters.” This indicates that God’s way is hidden. But we can know the hidden way of God by being in His sanctuary.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 78—MAN’S FAILURE AND GOD’S RESTORATION</h2><p>Psalm 78 tells how God built His sanctuary among His people, in spite of their dishonesty, unfaithfulness, instability and failures. The first section, verses 1 to 58, which is the main part of this Psalm, tells how the people failed God. Verses 59 to 64 record how God forsook the people and even His tabernacle among them. “He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men” (v. 60). This tabernacle was God’s dwelling place before the temple was built. “He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance” (v. 62). Then verses 65 to 72 tell us how God restored the people and built His sanctuary among them in a better way. “Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach” (vv. 65-66). The Lord had abandoned the tabernacle, His dwelling place, as though He were sleeping; but now the Lord awoke as One out of sleep. “(He) chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever” (vv. 68-69). This indicates that sometimes, whether we are faithful or not, the Lord will still do something to accomplish His own purpose. The Lord chose a place and built up His sanctuary, exalted as high as the heights of the heavens and stable as the earth.<p>Verses 70 to 72 say that in God’s restoration, He also chose David (the type of Christ) to shepherd His people. With the Lord’s recovery there is always the shepherding, the feeding of Christ.
