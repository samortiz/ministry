<h2 class="head3">3. The Pride of Israel Testifying to His Face</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says that the pride of Israel testifies to his face and that Ephraim and Israel would stumble in their iniquity. Judah also would stumble with them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Going to Seek Jehovah but Not Finding Him</h2>
<p>With their flocks and herds they would go to seek Jehovah, but they would not find Him. He had withdrawn Himself from them (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Acting Treacherously against Jehovah</h2>
<p>They had acted treacherously against Jehovah, for they had begotten strange (illegitimate) children. The invaders at the new moon would devour them with their apportionments, with their possessions (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Ephraim Being a Desolation<br />
in the Day of Correction</h2>
<p>Behind Benjamin would be the enemies, and Ephraim would be a desolation in the day of correction (punishment). This was sure (vv. 8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Princes of Judah Becoming like<br />
Those Who Move a Boundary Mark</h2>
<p>The princes of Judah had become like those who move a boundary mark to enlarge the size of their estates, and Jehovah would pour out upon them His overflowing wrath like water (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Ephraim Being Oppressed, Crushed by Judgment</h2>
<p>Ephraim was oppressed, crushed by judgment, for he was determined to walk after man&rsquo;s command (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Jehovah Being like a Moth to Ephraim</h2>
<p>Jehovah was like a moth to Ephraim and like rottenness to the house of Judah (v. 12). In the Bible God is usually likened to positive things, but here He is likened to negative things, things that consume.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. Ephraim Going to Assyria</h2>
<p>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to King Jareb. But that king could not heal him, and the wound would not depart from him (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. Jehovah Being like a Lion to Ephraim<br />
and like a Young Lion to the House of Judah</h2>
<p>Jehovah would be like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. He would tear them and go away. He would carry them off, and there would be no one to deliver them out of His hand (v. 14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. The Lovingkindness of Ephraim and Judah<br />
Being like a Morning Cloud<br />
and like Dew That Departs Early</h2>
<p>The lovingkindness of Ephraim (Israel) and Judah was like a morning cloud and like dew that departs early. Therefore, Jehovah hewed them to pieces by the prophets. He slew them by the words of His mouth, and His judgments went forth as light. For He delights in lovingkindness and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings (6:4-6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. They like Adam<br />
Having Transgressed the Covenant</h2>
<p>They like Adam (or, men) had transgressed the covenant. There they had acted treacherously against Jehovah (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">14. Gilead Being a City of Those<br />
Who Commit Iniquity</h2>
<p>Gilead was a city of those who commit iniquity; it was tracked with blood. Like bands of robbers lying in wait for a man, the company of priests murdered on the way to Shechem, committing wickedness (vv. 8-9). Once again, this was the sin that involved the priests, who had become robbers.</p>
<h2 class="head3">15. In the House of Israel<br />
Jehovah Having Seen a Horrid Thing</h2>
<p>In the house of Israel Jehovah had seen a horrid thing: the harlotry of Ephraim was there; Israel had defiled itself (v. 10).</p>
<p>As we consider all these details concerning Israel&rsquo;s situation, we can realize how sinful Israel had become.</p>
