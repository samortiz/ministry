   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Son's Redemption and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His Constituting Us into His Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 7 to 12 of Ephesians 1 is another section, showing that we all have received redemption in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we were redeemed, we were fallen sinners who were in the depths of sin and far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was our condition and position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But one day we believed into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God not only regenerated us but also redeemed us in Christ v. 7 . This means that He rescued us out of the depths of sin, brought us back to Christ, and put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were there in sin, but now through the Son's redemption, we are here in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The little word in indicates an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's redemption has brought us out of sin and into Christ; now we are in an organic union with this wonderful, all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we remain in this organic union with Him, day by day He dispenses His divine element of life with all His riches into us to make us a treasure to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were sinners in sin condemned by God but today we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day after day by His secreting of His divine life into us, He makes us pearls, treasures, to make us God's inheritance see Rev 21:21, note 211, and Matthew 13:46, note 461 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are two major items in the blessings of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is redemption and the other is our being made the inheritance of God v. 11 . Today we have become God's inheritance, and God is waiting to inherit us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is not going to inherit sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He wants to make us a treasure for Him to inherit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why verse 18 speaks of the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the blessings God has given us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were in sin, but now we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ put us into Himself, and He is secreting His life element around us to constitute us pearls, a treasure, for His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The dispensing of Christ as life into us day by day makes us more and more a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we all become God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This section of the Son's blessings closes in verse 12 with the phrase "that we would be to the praise of His glory."</S>
