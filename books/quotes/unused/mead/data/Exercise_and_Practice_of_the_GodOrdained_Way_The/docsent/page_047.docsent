   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING CONCERNING SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After our talking to them about God, many people need to know that they are real sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is according to Paul's sequence in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He tells us first about God; then he tells us about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a good sequence, but we should not follow it in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should follow it in a very living way, in a very flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should first help someone to know God and then help him to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should help him to know he is a sinner, even sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To talk about sin is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should not say, "God is good; God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But you are not good; you are not righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This way of speaking is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In speaking of sin, you should begin by using the pronoun "we."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should say, "God is very good, but we are sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the second time you may say, "God is righteous, but I and you are not righteous," putting yourself first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third time you may change a bit more, saying, "You and I are not righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now you have come down to the fact gently.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, to jump down suddenly would hurt your talk and would hurt your purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you say, "You are a sinner," this may close the door.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After you go, he would put the Bible away and say to his wife, "This poor preacher he called me a sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can illustrate that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we should not ask people, "Have you ever stolen from people?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you never lied to people?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we illustrate, we should use ourselves, saying, "I can testify to you that I did a lot of stealing when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I stole chalk from the school.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times I stole some money from my mother's pocket."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are talking about ourselves, this really means we are talking about the new one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Surely everyone has stolen something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we say that we stole, that means everyone steals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our speaking will touch everyone's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times when we talk in this way, we will induce the hearer to say, "I must be honest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I did a lot of stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I even stole from my wife."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would confess to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we may say, "This is very good that you would tell us that you have stolen from your wife."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To bring someone to this point is like the work of a surgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can do a lot of things at this juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To learn how to talk about people's sin is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must learn to always use ourselves as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After this we may say, "I must also be honest with you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am a bad person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My temper is too bad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I love my mother to the uttermost, but after only five minutes I got angry with her.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How do you feel about this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is this not sin?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Bible God charges us to honor our parents, but quite often I did not honor my mother."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we illustrate in this way, we will touch his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever we talk to people about sin, the best conclusion is to have a prayer of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we should not tell people to pray and ask them to confess their sins to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not need to instruct them to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should simply begin to pray, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I did a lot of stealing, and I did a lot of lying."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should simply take the lead to confess our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Spontaneously, they will learn from us, and after we pray, they will continue by praying, "O God, I am also a sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the best way to talk to people concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After such a prayer, we have to tell them about God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, we cannot cover this subject in the same talk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the conclusion of our talk, we should help this one a little bit to know that our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At another time when the situation is right, we will be able to talk with him about forgiveness in a thorough way.</S>
