To Be Begotten as God's Firstborn Son</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. From Eternity Past without Beginning, Christ Was God's Only Begotten Son</H2><P>From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God's only begotten Son. As such, He possessed only divinity and was without humanity, because He had not yet become flesh to pass through death and enter into resurrection. In the Gospel of John the Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life" (11:25). In eternity past He was already resurrection just as He was life, but He had not yet entered into the experience of resurrection. For example, you may be a professor but still lack the experience of being a professor. The Lord is resurrection, and He has been resurrection from eternity past because He is God, who is resurrection. To be resurrected is to overcome and transcend death, that is, to enter into and come out of death. As the only begotten Son of God, Christ is resurrection from eternity, but then He did not have the experience of resurrection. It was not until after He had accomplished His ministry in the flesh through His death that He entered into resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. In Incarnation the Only Begotten Son of God Became Flesh to Be a God-man, a Man Possessing Both the Divine Nature and the Human Nature</H2><P>In His incarnation the only begotten Son of God became flesh to be a God-man, a man possessing both the divine nature and the human nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Through Death and Resurrection Christ in the Flesh as the Seed of David Was Designated to Be the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>Romans 1:3-4 tells us that through His death and resurrection Christ in the flesh as the seed of David was designated to be the firstborn Son of God. Before His incarnation, Christ, the divine One, was already the Son of God (John 1:18; Rom. 8:3). By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5). His resurrection was His designation. In the upcoming winter training, we will have a further crystallization-study of Romans to see something more concerning Christ's human nature and divine nature and how He was designated to be the firstborn Son of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
