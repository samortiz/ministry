   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIRST LIFE, THEN DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our service in the Body of Christ is based on our knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This knowledge comes from our experience of life, not from doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God first gives us life and then doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Life comes first, and doctrines follow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible shows us that Abraham had a special contribution for the Body along the line of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This did not come by a teaching he received concerning faith, and it was not brought about by him communicating a doctrine to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, it came about by Abraham being brought into a set of circumstances in which he learned to trust God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What was wrought into him through the fires of affliction was eventually ministered by him to the whole Body for its enrichment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First there was the life and lesson of faith and then the doctrine of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How did Martin Luther become competent to teach the church concerning the truth that "the righteous one shall live by his faith" Hab 2:4 ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not become competent by diligently studying the Bible as a textbook and then communicating the knowledge he had acquired; rather, he became competent through much suffering and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When his knees were worn from kneeling and his hope for justification was gone, the Lord revealed to him in a living way that a man is justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After he had this experience, he gained the doctrine of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Doctrine is necessary, but doctrine should follow experience, not precede it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First there should be life, and then doctrine should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First there should be the experience, and then there should be the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The order of the New Testament is first the Gospels facts and then the Epistles doctrines .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, we have the life of Christ, and then we have the teachings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not spend all of our time studying, analyzing, and investigating a doctrine; these are works of reeds and will fail when the test comes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The only thing that is useful is what God has wrought in us, and only this can render supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only way we can communicate to others in a living way is to communicate that which we have learned through experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Discipline, suffering, and trials are the means for God to constitute the word into us so that we may have something to give to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we want to be ministers for the building up of the Body of Christ, we must not shrink from any trial, discipline, or dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FIRST CORINTHIANS 12</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Corinthians 12:4-30 is divided into four sections:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 Subject vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4-6: Gift, ministry, and function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2 The gifts of the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>7-11: The main emphasis being on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3 The ministry of the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>12-27: The main emphasis being on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4 The work of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>28-30: The main emphasis being on God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The beginning of every section points out the main divisions, while the theme can be seen in the subject of that section.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Gift is related to the Holy Spirit, whereas ministry is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The bringing forth of the ministry is through the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The gifts are the vessels to perfect the ministries for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The goal of the gifts is to bring in the ministries, and through the ministries, the Christ that the church has learned, known, and gained is dispensed to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most of the revival movements today have gifts but no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is useless to exercise gifts all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to realize that gifts are secondary; the main thing is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we have a ministry, we can serve the Body and cause the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the members of the Body of Christ mutually affect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one member suffers, all the other members spontaneously suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes we feel strong because strength from other members has been transmitted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every member can affect the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why we should not live by ourselves but hold the Head and seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God conveys life to the Body through every member.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If life stops in you, you will not be able to supply others with life, and the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every individual failure causes damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a consequence, when one member suffers in the Body of Christ, all the members suffer with him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every member affects other members one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, we have to be in the fellowship of the Body in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have some good experiences, it is for rendering a supply to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are in some adverse condition, we must realize that this also affects other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>IN THE BODY, THROUGH THE BODY,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>AND FOR THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything we have is in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 1925 Brother T. Austin-Sparks was invited to America.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He met a sister there who had learned many lessons through her illnesses and who had subsequently rendered much help to many people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She had a ministry of life and was a person who supplied others with life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The lessons she learned were learned in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the kind of person God is looking for today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our living should be in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body; this should be our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May the Lord deliver us from individualism into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May the Lord show us the Body, and may we serve His Body with a ministry which is based on our knowledge of Christ.</S>
