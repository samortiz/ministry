After we have believed in the Lord, we have to settle one question: What should we do when a brother has sinned against us? In Matthew 18:21-22 the Lord Jesus told us that if a brother sins against us, we must not only forgive him once but seventy times seven times.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S FORGIVENESS BEING UNLIMITED</h2><p>Matthew 18:21 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" It is to our advantage that Peter asked this question. Although his spirit was wrong, his question helps us to clarify the matter of forgiveness. The Lord seemed to be saying, "You have asked how many times you should forgive a brother who has sinned against you. You should have asked instead how many times you should be forgiven when you sin against God." If God said, "I will forgive you seven times," this would be a very low standard indeed.</p><p>When we sin against God, His feeling is hurt. Yet our feeling is not that strong. When others sin against us, our feelings are hurt, and it is hard for us to let it go. Yet God is love, and love does not seek for its own gain. Although God is hurt, His forgiving grace is unlimited. Peter's question shows that he was seeking for his own gain. He suffered because he was hurt. The price he had to pay for forgiving others was himself, that is, the suffering of being hurt. This is the reason he asked the Lord, "How often shall others sin against me and I forgive them? Up to seven times?" Peter said this to show that he was quite magnanimous. Two or three times would have been enough to him, but he made it seven times. There was, however, something wrong with his basic premise. He thought God's grace is limited. The fact is that God's grace has no bounds; it is unlimited. It follows that the forgiveness which God's children practice should also be unlimited.</p><p>In Luke 17:3-4 the Lord said to the disciples, "If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him." After the Lord spoke, the disciples followed with a prayer asking the Lord to increase their faith. They found it hard to believe in the Lord's word. They felt that it was hard to believe that a brother could sin against another seven times a day and then repent seven times. They thought that it was inconceivable that such a one could be forgiven. Hence, they said, "Increase our faith." Under such circumstances, God's children should still forgive. Whether or not those who ask for forgiveness are genuine is not our concern. As long as a man asks for forgiveness, we should forgive him. Matthew says that we should forgive our brothers not only seven times, but seventy times seven times. Luke says that if a brother sins against us seven times a day and then repents, we have to forgive him irrespective of his motive. Whether or not his repentance is genuine, we have to forgive him. As long as he comes to us, we have to forgive him. In Matthew, Peter's conversation omitted the words "in a day" and somewhat changed the meaning. Luke speaks of the same incident related to the same person, but he speaks of a man sinning seven times in a day, repenting, and then being forgiven. Peter changed the same story around. He asked the Lord if it was enough to forgive seven times. By framing the question this way, he made love, grace, and forgiveness all qualities that are limited in nature. In Luke 17 the Lord indicates that love, grace, and forgiveness are all unlimited in nature. Peter's question in Matthew 18 made love, grace, and forgiveness all limited in nature.</p><p>The Lord Jesus realized that Peter had changed the wording of the question. His answer about forgiving one's brother revealed that this was not a matter of sufficiency. It was not a question of seven times, but of seventy times seven. God's love, grace, and forgiveness are unlimited. Humanly speaking, thirty-five times of forgiveness would stretch a person to his limit. Seventy times seven is something beyond the reach of human power. It is too heavy a burden. This shows us that the power to forgive is something beyond man. At the same time, those who receive forgiveness are not receiving it from man. They receive forgiveness from another power. Matthew 18:22 says, "Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven." The Lord indictes that forgiveness has nothing to do with the number of times one forgives. If anyone wants a number, let it be seventy times seven.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
