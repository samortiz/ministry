   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR PRACTICE Not Seeking to Draw People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Not Refusing People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this age the Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and minister life; He has not asked us to touch the situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if we are questioned about the situation in Christianity, we should avoid discussing it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not answer queries regarding Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not know what motives are behind the practices in each locality, but it is wrong to seek to bring people out of Christian groups into our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not reject Christians from other Christian groups, but we do not need to seek them out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not believe that the Lord wants us to seek out believers from other Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that the Lord wants us to take the gospel to every place and to minister life to His many children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord wants a situation among us that can influence His children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Over the past ten years, believers from many Christian groups have come to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am willing and eager to fellowship about spiritual things, but when the topic switches to the church, I avoid discussing it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am not afraid to discuss the church, but I feel that there is an inward forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, in Hong Kong a young person came to talk to me several times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During our conversations he brought up the church a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Another brother who was present told me, If you would simply touch the matter of the church and give him a little help, he will come to be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This young person is a pastor, and I have heard that he is very gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He repeatedly insisted that I answer him regarding the church, but I could only say, The question of the church cannot be resolved by any person but only by your spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although my word was clear and to the point, he did not understand what I said.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord definitely does not want us to lead others into our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where people meet and how they serve the Lord are entirely between them and the Lord; we cannot intervene in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this age we must minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When people contact us, they should touch something in us that is unforgettable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way they take or where they meet does not matter; we should not consider that our meetings are better than those in Christianity or that our meetings have the greatest number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such thoughts are not in resurrection, and we must condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must also condemn raising up meetings merely for the sake of having meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we raise up meetings in order to minister life, we are proper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not have any intention of competing with or comparing ourselves to others; the thought of competition is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers like to compare themselves with others, saying, That city would have been a good place to work, but we came a little too late; if we had come earlier, the opportunity would have been ours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a sweet, spiritual, or proper feeling; we should not have such feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are we living in life, resurrection, and the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Strictly speaking, the Lord does not want us to open up fields for the work or to establish churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord wants us to preach the gospel and minister life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I really hope that our gospel preaching is the going forth of the pure gospel and not just a work; I hope that we are ministering only life to people and that we are not concerned with the visible church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One brother wrote a letter to his classmates which said, In today s Christianity we should find the place in which we can touch God s presence the most.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today in Taipei the place in which we can touch God s presence the most is with the church in Taipei; therefore, I hope that you will come to meet here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is this in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, this is not in resurrection; this is not something that we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None of the brothers and sisters among us should do this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has not commissioned us to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If someone comes here and touches God s presence, that is between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he returns to Christianity, that is also between him and God and does not concern us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we meet someone who has never contacted Christianity, we should do our best to bring him into the Lord s churches, but we should not announce to people who are already in the realm of Christianity that God s presence is with us or attempt to draw them to meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a foolish practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they want to come, we should not refuse to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If Christianity misunderstands us because we do not refuse to receive them, that is God s responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A highly-educated woman in her fifties was recently saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After one meeting she said to me, When I come here, I really feel supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please tell me what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I answered, You should go home and make a complete consecration of yourself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should give Him the authority over you, and He will tell you what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what we should do; we should not do anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not we who gain people but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should condemn the aspiration to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only the Lord can gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>People can meet in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The important thing is for people to be gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must constantly deal with our motives.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God does not want us to be happy only because people come to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God s blessing upon us is for all to share, and there should be no boundaries dividing God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we should not use human hands, the hands of Uzzah 2 Sam 6:6-7 , to draw people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We welcome anyone who wants to come to serve and pursue the Lord together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many severe misunderstandings and persecutions have arisen in the past because we do not refuse to receive anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will happen again in the future; it is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we do not care about persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we try to draw people in or exhort them to meet with us, we have fallen; we should not do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The best attitude for us to have toward today s Christianity is to not ask about or concern ourselves with it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This does not mean that we despise the believers in Christianity and are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we meet a sinner, we should do our best to preach the gospel to him; when we meet a child of God, we should do our best to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If someone has something to minister to us, we should humbly receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christianity should not even exist in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our thinking should include only sinners and Christians, not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Such an attitude is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever we meet a Christian, we should not let Christianity be the focus of our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, I hope that the Lord would give us the mercy, opportunity, way, and grace to minister something of the true spiritual life to such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Allow the believer s spiritual life and the Holy Spirit to resolve all other questions.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I believe that those who live by God s life, are enlightened, and have the inward, heavenly wisdom will take such an attitude.</S>
