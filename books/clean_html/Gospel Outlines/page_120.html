<h1 class="title">THE HOLY SPIRIT CONVICTS THE WORLD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 16:7-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Holy Spirit came
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God not only sent His Son to accomplish redemption for us, but also sent the Holy Spirit so that we may understand the redemption.</li>
	<li>After God&rsquo;s Son had accomplished redemption and ascended to the heavens, God&rsquo;s Spirit was poured out so that men may understand God&rsquo;s redemption.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Holy Spirit convicts the world
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Holy Spirit causes man to know God&rsquo;s redemption by means of convicting him. Speak thoroughly on this point. Describe that the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s working in men and causing men to know God&rsquo;s redemption is the work of convicting the world.</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s convicting work is to cause man to know himself, Christ, and Satan.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Holy Spirit convicts the world concerning sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first aspect of the working of the Holy Spirit is to cause man to be convicted concerning sin. This is to cause man to know that he is a sinner.</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit causes man to see that he is born in sin, brought up in sin, and living in sin; that he is a sinner in every respect, and that he is under condemnation. <em>Expound on these five points.</em></li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit causes man to see that he is a sinner in Adam and is under condemnation; He reveals that the only way to depart from sin and to obtain forgiveness is to believe in Christ. If a man does not believe in Christ, he can only remain in sin and under condemnation. The Scripture says that the Holy Spirit convicts the world in respect of sin because man does not believe in Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Holy Spirit convicts the world concerning righteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s convicting man concerning righteousness is to cause man to know Christ.</li>
	<li>The working of the Holy Spirit in man firstly causes man to see that he is a sinner in Adam under condemnation, and secondly causes man to see how he can be justified in Christ and become righteous. The Holy Spirit causes man to see that Christ has died for men according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, that Christ&rsquo;s death has fulfilled all of God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, and that God has resurrected Him so that He can be the righteousness to those who believe in Him. Whosoever believes in Christ is justified and made righteous.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Holy Spirit convicts the world concerning judgment<br />
<span class="normal">The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s convicting man concerning sin is to cause man to know his condition in Adam. Man is sinful and condemned. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s convicting man concerning righteousness is to cause man to know Christ. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s convicting man concerning judgment is to cause man to know Satan. The Holy Spirit shows that Adam is sinful, Christ is the Redeemer, and Satan is the one judged. Man in Adam is condemned because of sin. Man in Christ obtains forgiveness of sins and is justified. However, if man follows Satan, he shall receive the judgment of sin. Since Satan is the originator of sin, he must also receive the judgment of sin. Although man in Adam followed Satan and committed sins, becoming a sinner, he can be redeemed in Christ, and be freed from the judgment of sin. But if man would not believe in Christ and would continue to remain in Adam and to follow Satan, then he can only be the companion of Satan, sharing the judgment with Satan. So the Scripture says that the Holy Spirit convicts the world concerning judgment because the ruler of this world, Satan, has been judged.</span></li>
<li>The result of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s convicting the world
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Causes man to confess that he is sinful and condemned.</li>
	<li>Causes man to receive Christ as the resurrected Savior, that he may be justified.</li>
	<li>Causes man to reject Satan and be freed from the pending judgment.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Summary<br />
<span class="normal">The three main points of this message are sin, righteousness, and judgment. These three things make up the history of the universe. Also in this universe there are three persons who are related to our salvation or perdition. The result of following the first person, the sinful Adam, is that man is condemned. The result of following the second person, the redeeming Christ, is that man is justified. The result of following the last person, the judged Satan, is that man is judged.</span></li>
