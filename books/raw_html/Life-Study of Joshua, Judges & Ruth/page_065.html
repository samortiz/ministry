<h2 class="head1">III. BECOMING A CRUCIAL ANCESTOR<br />
IN THE GENEALOGY<br />
TO BRING IN THE ROYAL HOUSE OF DAVID<br />
FOR THE PRODUCING OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another aspect of Ruth&rsquo;s reward is that she became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy to bring in the royal house of David for the producing of Christ (Ruth 4:13b-22; Matt. 1:5-16). This indicates that she had an all-inclusive and all-extensive gain with the position and capacity to bring Christ into the human race. She is thus a great link in the chain that is bringing Christ to every corner of the earth. We all are indebted to Ruth, for without her Christ could not have reached us. But wherever we may be on earth, Christ has reached us through Ruth.</p>
<p>The burden of this ministry is to produce Christ in the believers. This means that the goal of this ministry is not to teach you to be humble or merely to glorify God in your behavior. Rather, the goal of this ministry is to &ldquo;inject&rdquo; you with Christ, to impart Christ as an &ldquo;antibiotic&rdquo; to you. The more we receive such an injection, the more we will be able to sing, &ldquo;Christ liveth in me, / Christ liveth in me; / Oh! what a salvation this, / That Christ liveth in me&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #507). On the one hand, this injection of Christ will kill our old man; on the other hand, it will make us producers of Christ, those who minister Christ to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. TO CONTINUE THE LINE<br />
OF THE GOD-CREATED HUMANITY<br />
FOR THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ruth not only became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy for the producing of Christ, but she also continued the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ (Matt. 1:5-16). The incarnation of Christ was a matter of His being brought out of eternity into time with His divinity. In a practical way, this needs to take place in our daily living. Every day of our Christian life should be a continuation of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, with Christ being brought forth in order to be born into others through our ministering Christ to them. In order for this to happen, we all need to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and even speak Christ to others. Ministering Christ in this way will surely change us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. FIRST SAMUEL TO MALACHI<br />
BEING A LONG RECORD OF THE GENERATIONS<br />
FOR THE PROLONGED LINE OF HUMANITY<br />
FOR CHRIST&rsquo;S INCARNATION</h2>
<p>First Samuel to Malachi is a long record of the generations for the prolonged line of humanity for Christ&rsquo;s incarnation (Matt. 1:17).</p>
