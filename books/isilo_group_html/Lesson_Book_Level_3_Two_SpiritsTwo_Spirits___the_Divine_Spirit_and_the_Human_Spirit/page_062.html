[To be filled in spirit (v. 18) is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Our spirit should not be empty, but should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God (3:19)....Our spirit may be empty and flat, like a flat tire. If our spirit is flat, it needs to be filled with pneuma. We need to go to the heavenly "filling station" and get our spirit filled with pneuma. In this way we shall be filled in spirit. According to chapter three, we are to be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. If our spirit if filled with the riches of Christ, we shall have no problems in our Christian life.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TWO ASPECTS OF THE FILLING</H2><P>We have seen that there are two aspects of the all-inclusive Spirit (Lesson 7). One is essential (inward) and the other is economical (outward). These two aspects of the Spirit can be seen in the matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit.</P><P>[Acts 2:2 says that the wind filled the house where the one hundred twenty were sitting. The Greek word for "filled" here is pleroo, a word that means to fill inwardly, as the wind filled the house.</P><P>Verses 3 and 4 say, "And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were divided and sat on each one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out." The Greek word for "filled" in verse 4 is pletho (also used in 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9 and Luke 1:15, 41, 67). This Greek word means to fill outwardly. According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in verse 2; and pletho denotes to fill the persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in this verse. The disciples were filled (pleroo) inwardly and essentially with the Spirit (13:52) for their Christian living, and they were filled (pletho) outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry. The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the disciples (John 14:17; Rom. 8:11), whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them (Acts 1:8; 2:17).] Every proper Christian should experience both kinds of filling.</P><P>[After Pentecost, the experience of the Holy Spirit inwardly as well as outwardly was fully accomplished in the Head (the Lord Jesus) as well as in the Body (represented by the Apostles). From this time onward, all those who desire to experience the work of the Holy Spirit can experience both the indwelling and the outward descending of the Holy Spirit at the same time.]</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 3: Two Spirits-Two Spirits - the Divine Spirit and the Human Spirit &nbsp; pg 62</div><br></body></html>
