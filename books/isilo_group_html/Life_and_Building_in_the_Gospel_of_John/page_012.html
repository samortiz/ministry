BEING A NATURAL CONCEPT</h2>
<p>We need revelation, vision, and light so that we may be delivered from our natural religious concept. According to our concept, we were far from God, living without a fear of God, walking in a loose way, and doing many dubious things. After believing in the Lord, we think that we must learn to fear God, reject evil, and do good in order to please God. With such a concept, we focus on outward things. For example, we make a determination to worship every Lord&rsquo;s Day, to have a family worship time at home, to be meek and humble, to be full of love by helping others, and to be well-behaved by not troubling others. We make a list of regulations for ourselves, and we even kneel down and pray, &ldquo;Lord, lend me a helping hand. It will not be easy for me to do all these things, so help me. I want to please You.&rdquo; These natural religious concepts are based on the thought that God is far away in the heavens and that He is dignified, majestic, glorious, and worthy of our worship. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day, Christians &ldquo;go to church&rdquo; to worship Him. Regardless of what is being preached, they care only for one thing&mdash;&ldquo;going to church&rdquo; to worship God.</p>
<p>This was precisely my condition when I was young and I believed in the Lord. At first, I blindly believed that God was far away and sitting in heaven. As I progressed on my spiritual journey, I sensed more and more that He was also living in me. He lived in me and spoke in me, and His words were light. Slowly my concepts began to change. Now I realize that the Bible does not speak of God wanting man to worship Him as a lofty God in heaven. Rather, it reveals that as the Word, God was incarnated to enter into man on earth, to mingle with man as one, and to be man&rsquo;s life. This is the relationship that God desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING THAT MAN RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE</h2>
<p>God is not focused on man worshipping or serving Him; He is focused on man receiving Him as life and letting Him live in him and be his life. When I saw this, I felt that the Bible is filled with the matter of life from the first page to the last. In Genesis God placed man in front of the tree of life after He created man. This indicates that He wanted man to receive life. When the Lord came to the earth, the apostle John said, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (John 1:4). The Lord also said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (10:10). At the end of the Bible, the tree of life is growing on this side and on that side of the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2). The fruit of the tree of life is for man to eat, and the water of life is for man to drink. God wants to fill man and to be enjoyed by man.</p>
<p>This light has become brighter and brighter in me. I am clear that God wants to be our life. God does not want us to do anything but receive Him as our life. I hope that we all can have a change in concept not to limit our believing in the Lord to the matter of outward worship. This is not to say that worshipping God is wrong but that such worship cannot satisfy God fully. Our Lord not only wants us to worship Him but also to receive Him as life. Worshipping Him is secondary; receiving Him as life is primary. Without receiving Him as life, we have no way to be proper worshippers.</p>
<p>We all know that certain things can be done only by a certain life. For example, a bird can fly in the air because it has a bird&rsquo;s life, and a fish can swim in the water because it has a fish&rsquo;s life. Worshipping God is an even more specialized matter than flying in the air or swimming in the water. Hence, we must have God&rsquo;s life in order to worship and serve God. Without God&rsquo;s life, we cannot worship or serve God. Worshipping God is a particular function that comes out of God Himself.</p>
<p>The worship that God wants from us is the worship that is the result of His entering into us. While people in the world do not understand this, those who have obtained God&rsquo;s life know how to worship, serve, and please God. Although it is good for us to come to the meetings with the thought of worshipping God, this is only a secondary matter. The primary matter is to touch God. He is the Word as well as the Spirit (John 4:24). Therefore, we should focus not on religious, ritualistic worship in our meetings but on contacting the Lord in our spirit. When our spirit contacts and touches God, and He speaks in us, we are made alive, and we are full of light.</p>
<p>We all need the word of God and the life of God. Whether we are deep or shallow in our experience of the Lord, we all need God to speak and to shine in us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
