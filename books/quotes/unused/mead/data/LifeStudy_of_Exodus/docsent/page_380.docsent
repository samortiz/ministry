   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPRESSING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have been under God s judgment in a full way, the righteousness of God will be expressed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is true both in the church life and in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a brother and his wife are willing to be under God s judgment, spontaneously God s righteousness will be upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Others who visit their home will be able to see the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if the husband justifies himself and the wife justifies herself, then visitors in their home will not see anything of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, they will see two strong expressions of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BRONZE, SILVER, AND LINEN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elements of the gate of the court of the tabernacle are bronze, silver, and linen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gate is constituted of these three elements.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The bronze used in the sockets and the pillars is the basic material.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sockets are for the base, and the pillars are for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that the capitals on top of the pillars were overlaid with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These capitals were a crown and indicate that redemption crowns God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s judgment brings forth redemption, and redemption crowns God s judgment with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the hooks used for holding the linen to the pillars were of silver, and the connecting rods were also of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By means of these hooks and rods, the pillars could stand as one entity to hold the linen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have emphasized the fact that the linen signifies the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, here we have God s judgment with the redemption of Christ as a crown to hold God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the front of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When sinners outside this building hear the glad tidings and repent, they experience an inward convicting through the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit of reality works on them to convict them and to cause them to condemn the self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This leads them to repent before God; they realize that, because they are fallen, they must be under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With us fallen creatures, there is nothing that can be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, Paul says in Romans that no flesh shall be justified before God Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, the entire old creation must be judged, condemned, by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we submit to this divine judgment and condemnation, we shall simultaneously experience the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we shall see that Christ died not only for our sins, but also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we realize this, redemption crowns us and links us to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, redemption brings in the righteousness of God as our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First we are judged by God and then redeemed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ now hangs upon us as God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We bear the righteousness of God as the expression and testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we are those judged by God and redeemed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With others, we are the church to become a testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We remain human beings, but we are human beings who have been judged, redeemed, and linked to God s righteousness, bearing Christ as God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we bear the Triune God as our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>PREACHING AN UPLIFTED GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to learn to preach the gospel according to what is revealed in the typology of the gate of the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must exercise our faith to preach such an uplifted gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not preach a gospel that has been lowered down to what we think is the level of people s understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of bringing people up to the level of the gospel, many of us have lowered the thought of the gospel when presenting the truth to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For years, I did this when I preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I realized that many of those in the audience were pagans.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some were Buddhists.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They did not know God, they did not know anything about the gospel, and they had never heard the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because I considered their situation, I did not preach an uplifted gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Missionaries to China also had this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Deep within, they had the thought that the Chinese people were not able to understand such matters as redemption, justification, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This caused them to lower the level of their gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to realize that within man there is a God-created talent, ability, to receive God and to receive and understand His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>People in the educational sphere have learned that children have the ability to understand more than teachers formerly thought they could understand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as children are often able to understand more than their teachers realize, so unbelievers can understand more of the gospel than we realize.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we preach the gospel, we must believe that those listening were created by God with a certain ability, a talent, to receive and understand the message of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to improve our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should preach an uplifted gospel and never lower the concept.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes our preaching of the gospel has been too simple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may emphasize one point: without Christ life is vain and people are empty, but with Christ there is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to preach an uplifted gospel, a gospel that covers more than the ABC s of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This will satisfy the hunger and thirst that is within man because of the way God created him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It will also stir up the interest of those who hear to come again to hear the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Otherwise, they may come just once.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Having received a cup of plain, tasteless water, they will not care to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I would encourage the leading ones in all the churches to fellowship concerning the presentation of the gospel, especially how to enrich and uplift our gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am not saying that it is necessary to give a long lecture or sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even in a rather short message we can present something solid and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man was created for God, and within him there is the ability to understand the things of God, and there is a hunger for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, as we preach the gospel in an uplifted way, we must believe that the hearers have the ability to understand what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Gospel preachers such as George Whitefield and Charles Finney had the ability to awaken people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whitefield prayed daily, sometimes for hours.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result, the people who came into contact with him experienced an awakening.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The same was true of Charles Finney.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I was told that once he visited a factory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As soon as he entered a certain room and looked at the workers, some of them began to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the awakening power.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, in this message I am speaking not about the power of the gospel, but about the content of the gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to enrich and uplift the word of our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we would preach an uplifted gospel, we ourselves must know and experience all the contents of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In particular, we need to know the truths of the gospel typified by the gate of the court of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to know the significance of the numbers three and four and of the materials, the elements, of bronze, silver, and linen.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to know judgment, redemption, and righteousness, and to know that the Triune God is a God of judgment, redemption, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As the gate of the court indicates, the Triune God is involved with man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This involvement has the elements of judgment, redemption, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As we preach the gospel, we need to declare that God is such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>With this message we conclude our study of the tabernacle itself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Next we shall consider the lighting of the lamps and the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I hope that we shall all be impressed with a clear picture of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This picture will be more helpful than thousands of words.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Not only should we see this picture; we should have it impressed deeply into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then we shall have the proper understanding of the bronze, the silver, the gold, and the linen.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hallelujah for this picture of the tabernacle, the court, and the gate!</S>
