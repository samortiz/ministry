   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CHRIST IS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; Matt 3:2; 5:3, 10, 48; 6:9-10, 31-33; Rom 14:17; Rev 11:15; 2 Tim 2:12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter, we saw that man is God's expression and His representative with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His creation God made man in His image and entrusted man with His dominion Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have these two words: image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Image is a matter of life, whereas dominion is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we have the divine life and the divine authority involved here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since man was created in the image of God, this means that man was meant to have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And since God entrusted man with His dominion, this means that man was meant to have the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To express God we need the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To represent God we need the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, man became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, God Himself came to be a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus was a wonderful man, and today, even in His resurrection, He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is a man in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Stephen was being stoned to death in his martyrdom, he saw "the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, today Christ in the heavens is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we have to realize that this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Christ was resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens, He came down as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b and as the Spirit of power Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Spirit, who is Jesus Himself, is now waiting for all the fallen human beings to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as a person receives Him, this wonderful One, Jesus, immediately enters into this person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means this person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be saved simply means to have Christ coming into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>REPENTING FOR THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know it is not a small thing to have Christ come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, there is something deeper than this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The opening word of the gospel of the kingdom is repent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to repent for the kingdom of the heavens Matt 3:2 because we have fallen from the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to have a real turn from the fallen state to the original state.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to leave the fallen situation and turn to God's dominion again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This dominion is simply the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christians today talk a lot about gospel preaching, but what do we preach as the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say we preach Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is right, but it is still inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The gospel preached at the beginning of the New Testament was: "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were made in the image of God, and we were entrusted with God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we have to return to God's dominion; then we will have His image again.</S>
