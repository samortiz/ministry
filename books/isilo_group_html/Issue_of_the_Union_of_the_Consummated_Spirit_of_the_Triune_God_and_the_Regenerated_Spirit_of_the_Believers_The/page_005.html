BEING THE COMPOUND SPIRIT<br>AS THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</H2><P>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment (Exo. 30:23-25). The Spirit's being a compound indicates that His elements are not just one but many. The compound Spirit is an ointment, not just oil. If He were just oil, He would not require compounding. However, the Spirit as an ointment requires many elements to be mingled together to become a compound ointment, which includes the elements of the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ. These six elements have been mingled together to become an ointment. Hence, the Bible says that this consummated Spirit is an ointment (1 John 2:20, 27). The processed Triune God became the anointing ointment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT,<br>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>This compound Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, who is also the Spirit of life (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2a). The matter of giving life is not simple. God Himself is life, but it is not simple for Him to give His life to people. How can He as God give His life to us? As the God of holiness, He is holy, but we human beings are common. He is righteous, but we are unrighteous. He is bright, but we are dark. How can this God, who is holy, righteous, and bright, give His life to us, the human beings, who are not holy, not righteous, and not bright? This was not possible until He passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection and became a life-giving Spirit. It was at that time that He was able to give His life to us who are common and sinful. This is because He passed through the death of the cross and resurrection to redeem us who are sinful and not proper. His redemptive death not only delivers us from sin, but it also includes many other elements which release us from the troublesome situations related to sin, thus making it possible for Him to give His life to us who are redeemed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. BEING THE LORD SPIRIT</H2><P>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is also the Lord Spirit. God is God, and He is also the Lord. God is God, and He is also the Spirit. Eventually, He became the Lord Spirit. This is what 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 tells us. If He were not the Lord, He could not have become the Spirit. For the Lord to become the Spirit, He had to be the Lord. He is the Lord Spirit, and this Lord Spirit is for our transformation (v. 18). We are being transformed every day from one degree of glory to another degree of glory, until we are transformed into the image of the firstborn Son of God. This transformation is carried out by the Spirit who is both the Lord and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. BEING THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><P>This compound life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. First, He is the Spirit of God, who went through human living, death, and resurrection with Jesus Christ. Then, He is also the pneumatic Christ Himself, who has the bountiful supply of the experience of human living, death, and resurrection in His flesh. Philippians 1:19 says clearly that the Spirit of Jesus Christ has the bountiful supply. Such a Spirit has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply. However, in what aspects is He the bountiful supply? He is the bountiful supply in the aspects of His incarnation, His human living, His death, and His resurrection. In these aspects there is the bountiful supply in the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of the Union of the Consummated Spirit of the Triune God and the Regenerated Spirit of the Believers &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
