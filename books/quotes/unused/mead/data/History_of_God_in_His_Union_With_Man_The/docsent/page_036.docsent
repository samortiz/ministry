   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Appointing Seth to Replace Abel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God appointed Seth to replace Abel Gen 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the only thing the Bible says concerning God's work on Seth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abel did not live long.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was martyred, so there was the need of a continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Right away God came in and appointed Seth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word appointed is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For God to appoint Seth to replace Abel means that Seth was the same as Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was also God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God Beginning to Have His Name</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Called Upon by Enosh</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God began to have His name called upon by Enosh Gen 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also need to give the credit for this to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do we think calling on the name of God was initiated by Enosh?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, it was not initiated or motivated by Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God moved Enosh to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The name Enosh means frail, mortal man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Enosh was very frail, weak, and fragile, so he realized he had nothing to trust in. At that juncture God came in to motivate him to call spontaneously, "O Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>O Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Calling on the Lord's name started in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people oppose the truth and practice of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we have to realize that all real Christians, when they feel they are so weak and fragile, would spontaneously call, "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even before we knew the truth concerning calling on the Lord's name, many of us practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we got into trouble, whenever we felt so weak, fragile, and helpless, we spontaneously called, "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, when we felt so weak and helpless, God the Spirit motivated us from within to call, "O Lord, help me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was not only the practice of calling upon the name of the Lord but also God's working.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the positive doings we see in the Bible are always something motivated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We human beings actually are not inventors but imitators.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is the unique Inventor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God invented everything, so He is the One who motivates, who invents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are those who follow His motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we were saved, there were a number of times when we could not manage our situation, so we called upon Him and exercised our whole being to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In mainland China during the Second World War, I was put into prison by the invading Japanese army.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While I was there I spontaneously called on the Lord and exercised my whole being to trust absolutely in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time it was a small thing for the invading Japanese army to kill people, and I was under their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They could have killed me at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I had not trusted in the Lord, in whom could I have trusted?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He motivated me to trust in Him.</S>
