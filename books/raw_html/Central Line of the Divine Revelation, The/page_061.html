<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. As the Revealing Spirit,<br>Showing Us the Deep Things of God<br>concerning Christ as Our Portion<br>for Our Enjoyment</H2><P>As the revealing Spirit, the Spirit shows us the deep things of God concerning Christ as our portion for our enjoyment, foreordained, prepared, and given to us by God but having never been seen or heard by man and having never come up in man's heart, for the dispensing of all the mysterious riches of Christ into our spiritual being for our glory (1 Cor. 2:7-12). Christ is rich in many items. According to 1 Corinthians, Christ is rich first in His being the power of God and the wisdom of God (1:24), and then in His being righteousness, sanctification (holiness), and redemption to us (v. 30). He is rich in at least twenty items in the book of 1 Corinthians. The final and consummate item of Christ's riches in that book is that He is the life-giving Spirit. If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, we could not receive Him as wisdom and power and as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. For us to receive Him, He must be the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>The dispensing of all the mysterious riches of Christ into our spiritual being is for our glory. We are whatever we live. If we live such a rich Christ, how glorious we will be! The way to live such a Christ is by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). By the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we can participate in His bountiful supply in order to magnify Christ by living Him. What a glory this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. As the Spirit<br>of the Divine Fellowship,<br>the Divine Flow, Imparting, Dispensing,<br>the Love of God in the Transfusion<br>of the Grace of Christ for Our Enjoyment</H2><P>As the Spirit of the divine fellowship, the divine flow, the Spirit also imparts, dispenses, the love of God in the transfusion of the grace of Christ for our enjoyment (2 Cor. 13:14). Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." This is the blessing in the transfusion of the Triune God in three aspects&#151;love, grace, and fellowship&#151;into us for our enjoyment. We enjoy the Triune God&#151;the Father as love, the Son as grace, and the Spirit as the fellowship, the flow. These riches are a great blessing to us.</P>
