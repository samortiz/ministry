<h2 class="head1">CORRECTIONS</h2><p>The name list of the responsible ones in each church in Wu-Yi contained both elders and deacons and deaconesses. Wu Jou-shiang, Gu Zhang-feng, Hsu Chi, Chui-feng, and Chu Hwei-ai are all deaconesses. I am sending this as a correction&mdash;Ding Keh-chang.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) All letters concerning the work, whether from the disciples or the apostles, are published in the column "News of the Work." All letters concerning the churches are published in the column "News of the Churches."</p><p>(2) Beginning with this issue, we are publishing a translation concerning the principles of service. We are in a time of emergency, and the mail is often blocked. We are doing our best to put all the news into the publication, because many news items need to get to the readers in a timely manner. The editor is aware of the increase in the number of pages, but we feel that it is best if the brothers and sisters can learn all the news from every locality as early as possible.</p><p>(3) Some of the letters are very ordinary. The reason we did not delete them is that we can see how God graces our brothers and sisters. They also bring in a kind of closeness. In one letter there was a request to bring an iron. The editor was planning to delete the sentence, when she suddenly thought about the word in 2 Timothy 4:13: "The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come." We decided to keep the sentence about the iron. Practical daily events are not altogether unspiritual. If it is a spontaneous, honest letter, does it not add a little of the flavor of the house of God?</p><p>(4) One brother may be concerned about something that another brother is not interested in at all. Another brother's concern may mean nothing to a third brother. Therefore, the editor can only objectively think about all sides and do her best to enable the brothers and sisters to communicate their news with each other. Our past experience shows that the brothers and sisters have been comforted by this publication. Even the editor has learned about many brothers and sisters whom she has never seen before and has begun to care for them, too. Even some brothers who had questions about us because of rumors that they had heard have had their misunderstandings resolved through this publication. Therefore, the editor dares not restrict the news of the churches with boundaries of locality or truth. We only hope that through the letters from every place, love and oneness in Christ can be expressed.</p><p>(5) In the news of the work, there are naturally many paragraphs which are in the nature of reports. The editors would like to quote a few sentences from The Normal Christian Church Life:</p><p class="indent1">The Bible shows us that it is not only permissible, but necessary, to give reports of the work to those who pray for us and are in one accord with us. However, reports are not advertisements, so they should not be in the nature of advertisements. It is precious to give the children of God reports of messages and other news. However, if the nature of the report has been corrupted with a motive, it is not acceptable to God. On the other hand, there is no example among the apostles of unnatural reticence or soulish seclusiveness of a better-than-you-are sort among God's children. It is all a matter of motive. All things are pure to the pure. Nothing is pure to the impure. [Translator's Note: The preceding paragraph is based on the Chinese edition of The Normal Christian Church Life.]</p><p>Therefore, we hope that the motive of those who send in reports and the attitude of those who receive them are both pleasing to God.</p><p>(6) The many difficulties, needs, and requests for prayer are not intended to be given to every reader as a burden. A heart of love feels no burden. "For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have" (2 Cor. 8:12). Therefore, it is not a question of doing or not doing something. It is a matter of having the heart. If one does not have the heart, it will not be beneficial even if one does it. If one has the heart, one prayer, one small offering, or one drop of sympathy can strengthen, comfort, and encourage others.</p><p>(7) The editors would like to speak a word of mutual exhortation to the co-workers. Our basis for our dealings with any person or matter should be love. We should reject our own "self." We should break our own "heart." We often shout the slogan of the cross, but it is better to bear the mark of the cross in our body. Not all the co-workers used by God are our co-workers by the narrowest definition. However, when we contact them, if we do not have the heart to receive instructions from them, we should at least have a heart of blessing toward them and ask God to bless them. We are merely using the light of the truth to serve the churches. We do not want to overstep the boundary which God has given us and trample on another's work. If one is humble and considers others stronger than himself, it will be easy for him to receive benefit from others.</p><p>(8) Finally, this issue was prepared and edited during travels. The final copy is then sent to Hankow for printing. The punctuation marks are often misread by the print shop, but we cannot correct every error. We ask all the writers to forgive us.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />April 30, 1938, in Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is still being published in Hankow. We ask that all news of the work, news of the churches, subscription orders, and questions be sent directly to Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) Please put the date on your letters. (If there is no date, we do not know when your letter was written.) Write your address clearly and in detail. If anyone removes the envelope from a letter which was sent to them and then delivers the letter to us, please write the address of the writer on the letter.</p><p>(3) Whenever a subscriber changes his address, he should send us a letter immediately, if possible.</p><p>(4) Issue No. 13 of The Christian is being printed in Shanghai. It will still be sent from Shanghai. Any letters concerning subscribing to or wanting information about The Christian will be forwarded to the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. They will be recorded, sent, and answered in Shanghai.</p><p>(5) Because the post office in Shanghai does not accept large amounts of printed material, it is best for each locality to print their own gospel tracts. It will be more convenient that way.</p><p>(6) The Gospel Book Room has established a branch store in Hankow. Anyone in the region of Hankow can buy books from Hankow. If you live in Hankow, please come to buy your books at Gospel Court, 1 Hsiao-Dong-Jia Alley. When Hankow lacks books, Shanghai will send what is needed, but please forgive us for adding a charge for the postage.</p><p>March 30, 1938, in Hankow</p><h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>The Open Door emphasizes the gospel work in each locality.
