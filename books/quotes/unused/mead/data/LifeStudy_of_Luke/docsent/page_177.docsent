   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSTITUTING THE QUALIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE BASIC FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE MAN-SAVIOR S DYNAMIC SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The highest standard of morality constitutes the qualification for the Man-Savior s dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the Man-Savior has this qualification; no other person, including Confucius and Plato, is so qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Gospel of Luke there are a number of cases illustrating that the Man-Savior s standard of morality qualifies Him for dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The best illustration is the parable of the good Samaritan 10:25-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Samaritan lived the highest standard of morality, and He saved the fallen one by His standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The highest standard of morality also constitutes the basic factor for the Man-Savior s dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We see this in the case of Zaccheus 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of the Man-Savior s dynamic salvation, Zaccheus became another person immediately after coming into contact with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Man-Savior came to the house of Zaccheus, He came with the Spirit of power Luke 4:18 and with the indestructible eternal life Heb 7:16 to impart into him at his believing in Him John 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of power and the eternal life were both conveyed in the highest standard of His morality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He, as such a dynamic Man-Savior, looked at Zaccheus and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house, Zaccheus responded.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may compare Zaccheus to an electrical toy that responds as soon as electricity flows into it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What made Zaccheus respond as he did?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was the Spirit with the eternal life, as the divine electricity, that flowed into him from the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the Spirit, there would have been no way for Him as the eternal life to get into Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His humanity in the highest standard of morality was the wire conveying the electricity of the Spirit with the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit with the eternal life as the divine electricity was within the Lord s humanity of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He looked at Zaccheus and talked to him, the Spirit with His eternal life entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the years of His ministry on earth, the Lord Jesus was like a great magnet drawing people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Attracted by Him, the disciples left everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know from the four Gospels that great crowds went after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also have been drawn to Him by His powerful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason we spend so much time in meetings is that we have been attracted to the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have been drawn by His dynamic saving power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Man-Savior s dynamic saving power is constituted of His highest standard of morality in which His powerful Spirit and eternal life are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Triune God is a mystery, and the incarnation of Christ is also a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the Man-Savior s living on earth was mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, He was a magnet attracting His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, He came into His followers and made each one of them a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason that, as believers, we are a mystery to our relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not understand what we are doing day by day and why we are doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, we are all living a mysterious life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our being a mystery is altogether due to the Man-Savior, the God-man, whose divine attributes fill His human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have emphasized in this message, the Man-Savior s highest standard of morality constitutes the qualification for His dynamic salvation; it also constitutes the basic factor for this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we have been covering in this message is not merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have been considering a living Person, the God-man with the highest standard of morality as His saving power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not be content with teachings we need the Man-Savior with His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I encourage you to bring to the Lord this matter of the Man-Savior s highest standard of morality constituting His qualification and the basic factor for His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you bring this to the Lord in prayer, I believe that He as the Spirit will speak more to you concerning His highest standard of morality.</S>
