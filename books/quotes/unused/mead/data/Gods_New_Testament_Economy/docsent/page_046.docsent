   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE TRANSFORMING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 17, 18; 13:14 GROWTH IN LIFE AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus far, we have seen that the first Epistle, Romans, is on the Spirit of life, and the second Epistle, 1 Corinthians, is on the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The third Epistle, 2 Corinthians, is on the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows us that under the sovereignty of the Lord, the arrangement of the New Testament books is in a good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians what is stressed is the matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Transformation is emphasized in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first Epistle to the Corinthians we see the growth in life, with the indication that this growth is for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we grow, the more we will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, to grow is one thing and to be transformed is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Growth needs life and transformation needs the elements of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 3 we see the growth in life for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word transformation is not used in that chapter, but the issue of the growth in life is there indicating transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As God s farm 3:9 with planting, watering, and growing, the church should produce plants; but the proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones 3:12 , all of which are minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the thought of transformation is implied there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life that we may become the precious materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul continued in his second Epistle to the Corinthians from the growth in life to transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his first Epistle there are many points referring to the growth in life, but in the second Epistle there are not any points regarding the growth in life but a number of points referring to transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why we say that the Spirit in the first Epistle is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit that always gives life for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the second Epistle, however, Paul always points out to us the things related to transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we say that in 2 Corinthians we see the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The one Spirit is first life-giving and then transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word transformation is not mentioned in the first Epistle, but the indication of transformation is there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both the Spirit that gives life and the transforming Spirit are mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 6 tells us that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life, and verse 18 says that we are being transformed even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The life-giving in verse 6 leads to the transforming in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the first Epistle growth in life issues in transformation, and in the second Epistle transformation is the result of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Growth in life needs the life supply, but transformation needs the elements of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE ANOINTING, SEALING, AND PLEDGING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second Corinthians 1:21-22 shows us that this transforming Spirit is the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anointing, sealing, and pledging are different from life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To give life is to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To anoint someone there is the need of some ointment, and the ointment is full of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ointment may be likened to paint.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paint is a composition of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the elements, there could not be paint.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more I paint a table, the more elements are put on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Old Testament, the holy anointing oil is the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is compounded with four kinds of spices into one oil Exo 30:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This holy anointing oil is no longer merely oil, but a compound ointment composed of five elements.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more anointing there is, the more these elements are being added on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 2 Corinthians, the Spirit is the transforming Spirit, and this transforming Spirit is anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To anoint is to put more elements on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With transformation there is the need of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The petrification of wood is another good example of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the current of water flows through a piece of driftwood it carries away the old elements and brings in the new elements of minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the minerals entirely replace the cell structure of the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This transforms the wood into a piece of stone by the continual addition of new elements.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In like manner, the Spirit transforms us by adding more and more of the divine elements into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The transforming Spirit flowing through our being adds into us the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, His human living, His all-inclusive death, and His excellent resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these elements are carried into our being by the transforming Spirit, and these elements become the factors of our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, such a flowing Spirit is a transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit transforms us by putting into us more and more of the divine elements.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the Spirit anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sealing is also a matter of imparting some elements.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I were to stamp a piece of paper with a seal and the seal did not have any element of ink on it, we would not see anything on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose, however, that the seal is saturated and full of the element of ink.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I seal the paper, a mark or an impression is left on it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The mark is constituted with the element of ink.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without any ink element, there is no mark.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sealing is a marking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Holy Spirit, who is the transforming Spirit, is sealing us all the time, and this sealing makes a mark which people can read.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a new convert who has just believed in the Lord Jesus is happy and full of joy in the Lord, his cousins, in-laws, relatives, and friends recognize and know that he is now a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, they do not know and they cannot see what kind of Christian he is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After two years of growing in life and allowing the transforming Spirit to seal him every day, this sealing is always putting some elements upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After two years, all of his acquaintances will be able to read some mark upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They will testify that he is so extraordinary, fine, and excellent in his living and character.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a mark built up by the sealing of the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Anointing imparts God s elements into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The sealing does the same thing, but it also forms the divine elements into an impression, a mark, to express God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The pledge is a sample, a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In ancient times, the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, a pledge, according to the ancient Greek usage, was also a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By enjoying the sample we have a foretaste of what is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The anointing Spirit, the transforming Spirit, pledged Himself into us as a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The foretaste gives us a taste of God; this is also a pledge, a security, a guarantee of the full taste to come.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>By the anointing, sealing, and pledging, all the elements of the Triune God, including the wonderful process He went through, are imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The title the life-giving Spirit indicates the giving of life in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The transforming Spirit, however, involves the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging of the elements of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As we enjoy Him and open our being to Him, the divine elements are being added to us all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since I received the Lord over fifty years ago, I can testify that every day, through the anointing, sealing, and pledging, I have received more of the divine elements into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I believe that now a distinct and strong mark is upon me, and I must testify that I am enjoying many riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am also enjoying more of the pledge of God being my portion in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is all for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In 2 Corinthians 1:21-22 we see that through the anointing, sealing, and pledging, the believers are receiving more and more of the divine elements into their being.</S>
