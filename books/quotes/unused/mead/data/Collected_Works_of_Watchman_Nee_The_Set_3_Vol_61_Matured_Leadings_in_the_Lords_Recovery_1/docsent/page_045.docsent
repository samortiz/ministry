   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HANDING OVER EVERYTHING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SERVING THE LORD IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Handing ourselves over does not necessarily mean that we will become poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Handing over everything is different from merely living in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we hand ourselves over to God, we are not only giving Him our money but our time and future as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The cheapest and most shallow consecration is the consecration of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Heart consecration alone does not cause any pain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have not offered up our time, body, and future, we may say that we have consecrated everything, but in reality everything is still in our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The young people may say that they have consecrated themselves, but their consecration has not touched their education or their future occupation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today when you hand yourselves over, the church may send you with five or ten other saints to a school where there are no believers at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You will not only study in the school but also bring people to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If some do this, perhaps fifteen or even a hundred people will be saved by the end of a term.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church in Shanghai, some have handed themselves over, and they have been sent to study at Nanking Central University.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the coming days every consecrated one will need a change in his future and occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will go to school for God; his education will be merely a sideline.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you hand yourselves over to serve the Lord, you have to learn to work in coordination, not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In particular, you have to learn to accept the arrangement made for your occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A brother may be working alone in a company or business, and you may be assigned to join him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not ask how much money you will make.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You should ask how you can take care of the gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to take all the colleagues at work as your gospel prospects, and you have to preach in coordination with the other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you take up a job as a consecrated one, it is not for the sake of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it is, you are no different than the people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your real occupation is to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone from ten to eighty years old should make his service the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the whole church is mobilized this way, I believe the gospel will surely saturate Hong Kong and even all of China.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, handing yourselves over does not result in doing your own thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not mean coming on the Lord's Day and dropping some money into the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Handing yourselves over has everything to do with your future, your occupation, and your coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Acts of the Apostles shows us that the church suffered great persecutions after chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The nascent church was formed as a result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When persecution comes, the normal thing would be for all the believers to scatter, but the apostles were not scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the disciples were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While they scattered, they preached the gospel as they moved 8:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the church made a decision; both the apostles' staying and the disciples' leaving were for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before Acts 7 there was the practice of handing over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By chapter eight there was a well-organized preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason the number of believers in Jerusalem eventually reached tens of thousands in Acts 21.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church exists on earth for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, no brother or sister can live loosely or be a Christian carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone has to hand himself over and preach the gospel in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, Brother Ku was once the manager of Shin-Yi Dye Factory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day the brothers went to him and told him that everyone felt he should no longer remain in his job.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He prayed about it and felt that he should leave.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was making a good living as a manager.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now his salary is only one-fifth of what it used to be, but he has become very useful in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has a good testimony before the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is no longer giving himself to his factory but to serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Handing ourselves over should result in a fundamental change in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are no longer individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we serve the Lord in coordination with all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only has our past been consecrated and dealt with, even our future has been consecrated and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is all for the sake of breaking open a way for the gospel to spread through us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the past we preached the gospel when we felt like it, but we turned away from the brothers when we grew cold and disinterested.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether we were working or not, we were doing everything as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But now that we have handed ourselves over, we can no longer act individualistically; we must serve in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some brothers and sisters are studying at Catholic schools.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I advise you to depart from them according to the Lord's command Rev 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not be defiled by the unclean things 2 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if many of you brothers and sisters are together at the same school, and if you all have a strong spirit to preach the gospel and to bring others to salvation, I have no objection for your staying.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, you have to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should not be there only for your education, and you should not say that there is no need to change schools as long as you study the Bible, pray, and come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once you have handed yourselves over, you have to know God's will and arrangement every step of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have to serve in coordination with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You cannot go to a school merely for the sake of your education.</S>
