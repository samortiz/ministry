<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Promise<br>of the Seed of David</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Referring to the Resurrected Christ</H2><P>The divine economy and the divine dispensing are also seen in the promise of the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 1:1, 6; 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Rev. 22:16). The seed of David refers to the resurrected Christ, who carries out God's New Testament economy for the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the members of His Body (Acts 2:30-31; Matt. 16:16-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As God's Sure Mercies</H2><P>The resurrected Christ is God's sure mercies, of which Christ is the center and reality, shown to David through his descendant Mary, the mother of Christ (Matt. 1:16), for the dispensing of God Himself into all the believers of Christ in His resurrection (Acts 13:32-35; Isa. 55:3-4). According to Paul's understanding in Acts 13:34 and 35 (see note 1 on verse 34), the sure mercies shown to David are Christ Himself in resurrection. In Christ as the sure mercies, God reaches us in His grace to be our enjoyment. Because our situation was miserable and could not match God's grace, Christ not only took the step of incarnation to bring God as grace to us, but He also took the further step of death and resurrection in order to become the sure mercies to us in resurrection. Through His death and resurrection, Christ, the embodiment of God's grace, became the sure mercies, and through these mercies we are now in the proper position to match God and to receive Him as grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. For the Believers in Christ<br>to Share His Kingship</H2><P>Christ as God's sure mercies shown to David is for the dispensing of God Himself into all the believers of Christ in His resurrection. This is for the believers in Christ to share His kingship in His resurrection in the eternal kingdom of God (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6).</P><P>The divine economy and the divine dispensing in the promises of the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David have a threefold purpose: first, to destroy Satan and to save us from sin and death; second, to cause us to inherit the consummated Triune God as our blessing and inheritance; and third, to cause us to share Christ's kingship. These three items cover God's full salvation in a complete way. God's full salvation is to deliver us out of the hand of Satan and out of sin and death, to bring us into the full inheritance of God Himself as our blessing, and to cause us to share the kingship with Christ as His co-kings in the kingdom age.</P><P>The seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David all indicate the divine dispensing. All three of these seeds are just one seed&#151;a human being with God dispensed into Him. Christ, the God-man, is the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David. Now, in Him, God and man, man and God, are blended and mingled together as one entity. This entity is fully signified in, with, and by the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the totality of God's dispensing of Himself into humanity.</P>
