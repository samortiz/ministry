   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTIMATE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point I would like to say to all the saints, especially the young people, that to serve the Lord is not simply a matter of a way or a method.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Serving the Lord is something very personal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would serve the Lord, we must be a person who has an intimate relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Otherwise, we may be good Christian workers, but we cannot be those who are able to touch God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses was a man greatly used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In previous messages we have seen how Moses was raised up by God and trained by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses was raised up by God during the first forty years of his life, and he was trained by Him during the next forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Moses was eighty years old, God came in to call him and use him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God gave him a vision of a burning bush 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the fire was burning in the bush, the bush was not consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through this vision God seemed to be saying, Moses, you are like this bush.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I intend to use you, but I shall not burn you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I shall not consume you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I shall burn in you according to what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Moses was called by God in Exodus 3, there was not yet any intimacy between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moses was new to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their relationship can be compared to that between an employer and a new employee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God, the employer, spoke to Moses, the new employee, and asked him if he would accept the job.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that eventually Moses was convinced to take the job the Lord offered him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The period of time from the day Moses was called in Exodus 3 to the conversation between him and God in Exodus 32 and 33 was probably not more than two years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the course of this period of time, Moses became intimate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the record in Exodus, Moses twice spent a period of forty days alone with God on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the first forty days, God gave Moses the design of the tabernacle and the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is described in six chapters, Exodus 25 through 30.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you think that the content of these six chapters occupied God for those entire forty days?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This certainly would not seem to be the case.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What were God and Moses doing all that time?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may have been enjoying intimate fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The children of Israel may have tried to excuse themselves for making the golden calf by the fact that Moses was gone so long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of them may have said, We have not heard from the Lord or from Moses for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have left us here at the foot of the mountain, and we have been here for nearly forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord and Moses brought us out of Egypt and led us to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we don t know what has happened to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can t see God, and we can t see Moses either.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we must do something for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God, of course, did not give the people a chance to excuse themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, Moses did not allow the children of Israel, especially Aaron, to make an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If Aaron and the children of Israel had been allowed to excuse themselves, they probably would have blamed Moses for being gone too long.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They may have said, Moses, where have you been?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have been gone too long.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Does the Lord intend to have us for His people, or does He plan to have only you?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems to us that you and God have forgotten about us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may say that the Lord and Moses stayed together so long because they were intimate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They had a happy time together on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But that pleasant time was a time of testing to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later God asked Moses to go up to the mountain again, and they were together for another forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses and God simply liked to stay together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They loved each other, and they wanted to be together.</S>
