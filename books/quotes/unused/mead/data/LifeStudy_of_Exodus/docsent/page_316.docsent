   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. CHRIST AS THE RESURRECTION LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GROWING, BRANCHING, BUDDING, AND BLOSSOMING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO SHINE THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the lampstand is a growing entity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the lampstand typifies Christ, it indicates that Christ is the One who is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Remember that the lampstand is not made up of only one branch and one lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, as the central stalk grows, it produces three pairs of branches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, all the branches are growing and have knobs, buds, and blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the stalk of the lampstand begins to grow, it produces the first pair of branches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then as it continues to grow, it produces the second pair and finally the third.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, the stalk itself grows to its full measure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All this indicates that Christ is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ grows first in Himself and then also in us as the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apparently it is the branches that are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, it is the stand that is growing through the branches and within them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates Christ s growth in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not growing Christ is growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the central stalk, Christ grows in Himself, by Himself, and with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the six branches He grows in us, by us, and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This matter of Christ growing both in Himself and in us is not merely a doctrine; it is a vision which applies to us in our experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that there are six branches on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man was made on the sixth day; hence, six is the number of man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This number is composed not of two plus four, but of three plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number three in the Bible indicates the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although as those created on the sixth day we are the number six, we nonetheless have the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we are created men who are now in the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the significance of the number six composed of three plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the stalk, Christ is growing in Himself and with Himself; but He is also growing in us as the six branches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why we say that the lampstand does not portray a simple Christ, but rather a complicated Christ, the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lampstand also implies two other matters the wick and the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the lampstand did not have a wick and if it was not supplied with oil, it would be impossible for it to burn and give light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wick was made of material from plants and thus signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The oil, a symbol of the Spirit, signifies divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When humanity is burned in divinity, there is the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if our wick becomes too long, smoke will be produced instead of light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever there is too much wick and too little oil, there is smoking instead of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no mention in Exodus 25 of either the wick or the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we consider the picture of the lampstand given in this chapter, we shall realize that both the wick and the oil are implied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could the lampstand shine if it did not have a wick and a supply of oil?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the wick and the oil are implied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, the wick must be of the right length, in proper proportion to the lampstand, and there must be an adequate quantity of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the wick and the oil will work together to produce the burning, the burning will cause the shining, and the shining will give forth light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this burning and shining result from the growing, branching, budding, and blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>SHINING IN THE HOLY PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lampstand shines in the Holy Place; that is, it shines in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today Christians argue with us and ask, Why do you say that you are the church?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are we not the church just as much as you are?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no need to quarrel about who is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are truly the church, then you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if you are not the church, then you simply are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, I am a man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a fact no matter what others may say.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since I am a man, there is no need for me to advertise the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Likewise, if we are the church, there is no need for us to argue the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are the church, then the shining of the lampstand will surely be among us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that with the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies there are three kinds of light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the outer court we have the natural light, the light of the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since the outer court is in the open air, it has this kind of light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are completely covered.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This covering makes it impossible for the light of the sun, moon, and stars to penetrate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If it were not for a particular kind of light in the Holy Place, it would be like a dungeon full of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the Holy Place is full of light because it is enlightened by the shining of the lampstand with its seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever a priest left the outer court and came into the Holy Place, he could see the shining of light from the lamps on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The shining of the lampstand was proof that this place was indeed the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without the lampstand shining, that place would have been a dark dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the shining of the lampstand proves that it is the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The principle is the same with the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How can we discern who is the church and who is not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can determine this by discerning whether in the meetings there is darkness or the shining of light from the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whether or not a particular group of believers is the church depends on whether or not there is the shining of the lampstand among them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before we came into the church life in the Lord s recovery, many of us attended other Christian gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But we did not see the shining of the lampstand until we came into the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the meetings of the church we behold something shining.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I can testify that I was first in fundamental Christianity and then with the Brethren assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>With the denomination there was darkness, and with the Brethren assembly there was only a small amount of light.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when I came to the church in the Lord s recovery, I was not only in the light, but was even immersed in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This light is not a natural light, the light of the sun, moon, or stars; it is the light of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Psalm 73:16 and 17 say, When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. The psalmist was bothered, perplexed, and puzzled about a particular situation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When he thought about it, it was painful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thinking about the matter was unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But when he went into the sanctuary of God, the Holy Place, he received understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This means that he was enlightened by the light in God s sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many of us can testify that we have been troubled and perplexed about certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But when we came to a meeting of the church, we were enlightened, and the matter became clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How much light there will be in our meetings depends upon how much we have of the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we have more growth of Christ, we shall have more light.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Suppose the lampstand in the Holy Place was not fully grown or had grown in an unbalanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The lampstand would still shine, but it would not shine adequately or properly.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If the lampstand did not have the opportunity to grow in full, the light in the Holy Place would likewise not be full.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For this reason, we sometimes sense that the light in a particular church meeting is not very bright.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Yes, there is light, but there is not the full, complete shining.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>How much light there can be in the church depends on the extent to which Christ has a way to grow in us and through us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we all give the Lord a free course to grow within us day by day, there will be the adequate shining of the light whenever we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Only when there is the full growth of Christ within us can there be the full shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is crucial for all the branches to give the lampstand a free way to grow in them and through them.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The more the lampstand grows in the branches, the more it will blossom and shine, and the more light there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then when we come together in the church meetings, the light will gradually become brighter and brighter.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Many of us can testify of having been enlightened in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Certain things related to us that were covered or hidden were exposed by the light.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This light comes from the Christ who grows not only in Himself as the central stalk, but who also grows in us as the branches of the lampstand.</S>
