<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICAL STEPS<br />
IN IMPLEMENTING THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we love Your dwelling place, which is Your Body, Your church. Thank You, for gathering us together once again. May Your presence be with us in the depths of our being so that we would not become an organization but would move together with You in one accord as Your organic Body. Lord, we desire to learn to fulfill our function as members of the Body and to promote Your new way under Your love and Your grace.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You that You have Your testimony here in Taiwan, and thank You for entrusting this testimony to us and showing us the clear vision and the great commission. Thank You for showing us the practical way and giving us the clear leading. We want to enter into a deeper fellowship with You, to touch Your heart&rsquo;s desire in a more practical way, and to be enlightened concerning the details of how we should go on. We ask that You grant us a definite leading whether in personnel arrangements or in the financial supply. Teach us how to trust in You, believe in You, look to You, and work by You with diligence. Lord, it is not of those who will or of those who strive but of Your grace and mercy. We look to You to grant mercy to Taiwan, to all the inhabitants of this island, that this land would not only be gospelized, but that everyone would be saved unto Your name and become a child of God. May You have a strong and powerful testimony at the end time before Your return, a testimony that will affect the entire earth.</p>
<p>Lord, fulfill Your word today. For the past two thousand years the testimony of the church has not been fully manifested. Work this out today in Taiwan. Lord, give us this burden. We look to You not only concerning ourselves but also concerning the saints in all the churches. Just as You have visited us, cared for us, touched us, and moved within us, we ask You to do the same work within all the saints so that they will have the inner registration, the inner enlightening of their eyes, to clearly see the vision and to see the vanity of this world. May they see that everything is vanity, that there is nothing new under the sun, and that everything fails and can be compared to chasing shadows and the wind. Only You are worth anything, and only You are of eternal value.</p>
<p>Lord, we put ourselves, including what You have given us, all men and all things, on Your altar. Gain us. May we all be full-timers. May we live for You and unto You. Every day and every moment of our days are for You. Everything, every move we make, is for You. Lord, cleanse us, and may Your church be acceptable in Your sight. In Christ Jesus and by the Holy Spirit, we want to be priests, offering every saint in the churches under our care to You as a sacrifice. Lord, may they be acceptable to You. Sanctify them, and gain them in a deep way. Do a thorough work in them, a work beyond what we can ask or think. Lord, unless Your Spirit works deep within man, our work is in vain. May we all receive this burden to pray and to call on You day and night, until we see the New Jerusalem appearing as the praise of the earth.</p>
<p>Lord, accomplish an unprecedented work here in Taiwan. Do something earth-shaking in this age. Show the world a living testimony that is different from Christianity, a testimony that is the living expression of Yourself. Lord, fulfill this desire and answer our prayer. Hear our cry. We offer this as our sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor for Your satisfaction. This is not a personal prayer; it is the cry of Your Body. Lord, may this touch Your heart, move Your heart, and move the throne, so that You in turn will move the universe, move the world, move Taiwan, move every heart, and even shake every heart. Lord, we have seen the signs of Your opening the door in Taiwan. Your promise to Philadelphia is also a promise to us. Give us an open door that no man can shut. Lord, open the door of every house, and open the doors of the hearts. Lord, grant all the saints this burden, the adequate prayer, a thorough appreciation, and a strong consecration. May everyone offer himself for Your glorious move. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FIVE-YEAR SCHEDULE<br />
FOR GOSPELIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to speak of practical steps in carrying out the new way. We mainly want to show the brothers and sisters a schedule for gospelizing Taiwan in five years and some definite plans and actual implementations to achieve this schedule. For decades we have heard many spiritual terms and have become accustomed to them. We are used to terms, such as the &ldquo;leading of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;guidance of the Lord.&rdquo; As a result, we are not very concerned for the future. We do not make any plans. We only know to place everything in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and let the Lord do all the work. With this kind of understanding, all schedules and plans seem redundant and unnecessary. I have been saved for sixty-one years and have been working for the Lord for sixty years. As soon as I was saved, I loved to study the Bible, and through such study I entered into the realm of spirituality. I have accumulated sixty years of experience and have become very familiar with all kinds of spiritual principles. I have said many times that everything depends on the Holy Spirit and not on human arrangement. Therefore, I am very clear that the moment I mention the word <em>schedule,</em> we will think that this is a movement, and the moment I mention the word <em>plan,</em> we will think that this is organization. Actually, this is a wrong concept.</p>
