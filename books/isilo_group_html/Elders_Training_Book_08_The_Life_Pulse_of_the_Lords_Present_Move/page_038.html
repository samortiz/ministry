<h1 class="title">SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-20; Luke 24:44-49; Acts 1:8</h1>
<p>To spread the gospel is to preach the gospel. To preach the gospel is a very common, popular term among Christians. Concerning the preaching of the gospel in the Scripture reading in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, I do not quote one verse, but a section. Why? Because many today in Christianity have isolated the so-called preaching of the gospel from its context. They seem to make the preaching of the gospel something different from the proper preaching instructed, revealed, and ordained by the Lord. I want to quote all the context of these three verses regarding the gospel preaching in the first three synoptic Gospels and also fellowship concerning Acts 1:8.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATTHEW 28:18-20</h2>
<p>Matt. 28:18-19 says, &ldquo;And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying,...Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; At this juncture, Jesus came in resurrection. He had spent forty days with the disciples in His resurrection. At the end of those forty days He came and spoke to them saying, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth&rdquo; (v. 18). This simple sentence indicates that the speaker, Jesus our Lord, is not a simple person. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him. He is now the Lord of the universe because He has been given the authority in the entire universe. At this time, this One came in His resurrection, not in His flesh, nor in the natural form of a man in the flesh, to declare that all the authority both in heaven and on earth had been given to Him. Based upon this declaration He gave them the commandment, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; It is not just to preach the gospel to make them believers but to make them disciples. There is a big difference between believers and disciples. The word disciples in the English language is very much related to discipline. A believer may have little to do with any kind of discipline, but only discipline can create a disciple.</p>
<p>By this you can see that many Christians quote this verse in a shallow way, making others &ldquo;heaven-goers,&rdquo; rather than disciples. To disciple the nations means to make them disciples, to make them persons who belong to God in Christ and who are disciplined all the time. This includes a lot. It is not merely to preach the gospel to save people, but to bring in people through the gospel and to make them disciples through much discipline.</p>
<p>Many Christians argue about the matter of baptism in speaking about Matthew 28:19. Is this the baptism with water or the baptism with the Holy Spirit? If this is baptism with the water, should the water be hot water, cold water, salt water, natural water, water in the pool, water in the river, water in the sea, water in the bathtub, or what kind of water? I read only one person that stressed being baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Vincent in his <em>Word Studies of the New Testament</em> gives a marvelous and excellent interpretation when he comes to Matthew 28:19. He says that the name denotes the Person. The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His Person. To baptize into the name means to baptize into the Person. To baptize the disciples into the name of the Triune God means to baptize them into the Person of the very Triune God.</p>
<p>Vincent also tells us about the small preposition &ldquo;into,&rdquo; not in. Into indicates a kind of union (see note 19<sup>4</sup> in Matthew 28&mdash;Recovery Version). Vincent gave us these good points, but few readers have ever practiced this. We should charge the full-timers to go out to preach the gospel by &ldquo;discipling the nations, baptizing them into...&rdquo; The Lord Jesus does not say, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations <em>and</em> baptize...&rdquo; There is no conjunction and, so discipling and baptizing are not two separate items. To &ldquo;disciple all the nations, baptizing&rdquo; means that to disciple is to baptize, to baptize is to disciple. Baptizing is a modifier modifying the predicate disciple, telling us how to disciple. By what way do we disciple them? By putting them into the Triune God.</p>
<p>We should train our young full-timers to realize that our way to go out is to disciple all the nations by baptizing them or by putting them into the Triune God. In our gospel preaching we need to tell them who the Triune God is, who the Father is, who the Son is, and who the Spirit is. If we do not tell people about the Triune God, about the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, how could they realize that to be baptized is to be baptized into such a One? Many today make baptism just a ritual for people to enter into another religion. The Chinese regarded baptism as a ritual to take a Western religion. Their thought was that baptism was a kind of initiation for entering a new club. Most of the Chinese who were baptized had no idea about the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:20 there is another participle&mdash;teaching. Baptizing and teaching modify the predicate &ldquo;disciple.&rdquo; It is not so simple to go out to preach the gospel. To preach the gospel is not just to tell people that they are sinners, that Jesus is the Son of God who came to be their Savior, who died on the cross for their sins, and that when they believe in Him they will be forgiven and go to heaven. This is too low.</p>
<p>We have to tell the listeners who the Triune God is, the One into whom we intend to put them. Our preaching must have the intention to put the listeners into the Triune God. We have to tell them who the Triune God is, the substances of the Triune God. This is higher preaching. We have to use teachings as in verse 20, &ldquo;Teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; The last part of the verse is a promise. If we do this kind of preaching, surely He will be with us and we will enjoy His presence. He will be with us until the consummation of the age. This promise for us to enjoy is based upon the foregoing one and one-half verses.</p>
<p>This is a gospel that comprises the entire New Testament economy of God. To disciple the nations as one act needs two things to modify it. First, there is baptizing the people into the Triune God. Second, there is teaching them all the things we have been taught. This is the New Testament economy of God, and the One who was speaking this was the One in resurrection to whom all the authority in heaven and earth had been given. Putting all these things together you could see a clear picture of the entire New Testament economy of God. This is the kind of gospel we have to go out to preach and by which we disciple the nations, putting our listeners into the Triune God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
