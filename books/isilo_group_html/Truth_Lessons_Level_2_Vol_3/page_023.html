God</H2><P>As the believers' portion, Christ is God to us (Titus 1:3; 3:4). Most Christians regard God merely as an object of worship. However, from the Bible we see that God is not only an object of worship; He is our portion for us to enjoy.</P><P>In the conversation between the Lord Jesus and the Samaritan woman, John 4 indicates that the real worship of God is to drink of the living water in our spirit. In verse 14 the Lord said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life." In verse 24 the Lord went on to say, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness." These two verses show us that the worship of God is the enjoyment of Him as the real drink in our spirit. Hence, Christ as our God is the portion for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Redeemer</H2><P>Christ is also our Redeemer. In Him we have redemption (Rom. 3:24). To redeem means to purchase back something which originally was ours but which has become lost. Thus, redemption means to repossess at a cost. Originally, we belonged to God; we were His possession. However, because we became fallen and were lost, we became involved in sins and many other negative things that were against God's righteousness, holiness, and glory. We were under the threefold requirement of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory. It was impossible for us to fulfill the requirement, for the price was too great. However, Christ paid the price for us, repossessing us at a tremendous cost. He died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Heb. 10:12; 9:28), and His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). Therefore, He is our Redeemer.</P><P>Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom [the Beloved] we have redemption through His blood." This indicates that we have been redeemed in the Beloved, the One in whom God delights. In the sight of God redemption is something to be delighted in. We have been redeemed through the blood shed for us on the cross by God's Beloved. Now we can enjoy the Beloved as our Redeemer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Passover</H2><P>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul took the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers. In 5:7 Paul said, "Our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed." Paul considered the believers God's chosen people, who have had their Passover, as typified by the children of Israel's experience of the Passover in Exodus 12. In this Passover, Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover. To be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross that we might be redeemed and reconciled to God. Thus, we may enjoy Him as a feast before God.</P><P>In chapter six of the Gospel of John, with the Passover feast as the background, the Lord Jesus fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish. After He did that, He revealed Himself as the bread of life and went on to speak concerning our need to eat His flesh and drink His blood (vv. 35, 51, 53-55, 57). At the Passover, people slew the redeeming lamb, struck its blood, and ate its flesh (Exo. 12:3-11). This typifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who was slain so that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, thus taking Him as the life supply for us to live by. In the Lamb of God there are two elements: the blood for redeeming and the flesh, the meat, for feeding. Therefore, our enjoyment of Christ as our Passover comprises two aspects, the redeeming aspect and the feeding aspect. As the Lamb, the center of the Passover, Christ is our portion for our enjoyment to redeem us and to feed us as well.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
