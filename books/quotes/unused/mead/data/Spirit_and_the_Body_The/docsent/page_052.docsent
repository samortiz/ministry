   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME EXAMPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider, as examples, some of those who lived and walked in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, was such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A number of times the book of Acts says that Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was one who acted, walked, behaved, and worked in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit mingled with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In him the divine Spirit and the human spirit were mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was the same with Philip, who also was full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Acts 6 and 7, Stephen and Philip were people who lived, behaved, and walked in such a wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was not a doctrine to them; it was their daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They lived no longer in the soul, in the old being with the old personality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They lived in the new being, in the new personality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This new being, this new personality, was constituted by the Holy Spirit indwelling their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we saw this, there would be no need for so many kinds of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Apostle Paul and his co-workers were also such people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul and Barnabas lived and walked by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their soul, their old man with their old being and personality, had been crucified on the cross and buried with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, they had a new being, the inner man --Christ dwelling in their spirit and making His home in every part of their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Acts 15:28, the Apostles made a decision with the Spirit, saying, "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that they were one with the Holy Spirit and that their action was the action of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their walk, their daily life, and their work were altogether that of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING THE CONSTITUENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not simply a matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians today consider the Holy Spirit either merely as a power or as an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Holy Spirit is the constituent of our new being, not simply a power or an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit is not only a matter of power, but also a matter of constitution, a matter of our make-up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the Apostles lived according to this new being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Acts 16:6 and 7 reveal that as Paul moved in his ministry, he moved not by his old man, but by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>STIRRED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 17:16 says that Paul was stirred in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you were not regenerated, you could never be stirred in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You could only be stirred in your soul, because your spirit would only be an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, one could never say that he is stirred up in his body, because one's person is not the body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul could be stirred up in his spirit because his personality was in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, this verse is another indication that after regeneration our being, our personality, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, because many Christians do not have this light or this vision, they are still stirred up in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may be stirred in the soul by their husbands or wives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How we need to see that our new personality is no longer in our soul!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is in our spirit, which is constituted with Christ as our new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever we do, we must do it here in this new man.</S>
