<h2 class="head2">The Church as the Mystery of Christ<br />
Revealed to the Apostles and Prophets</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:2 through 11 and verses 16 through 19 contain three crucial points. The first point is the mystery of Christ. This mystery was hidden in God, who created all things. Why did God create the heavens, the earth, all things, and man? The purpose of creation was a secret that God did not tell the angels or the saints in the Old Testament. God did not tell this secret to Adam, Abel, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, or Malachi. The saints in the Old Testament feared God and were blessed by Him, but the mystery was not revealed to them, and they did not know it. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus was born two thousand years ago. While He was on the earth, He called a group of disciples and appointed them as apostles. Then through His Spirit, God revealed His mystery to the apostles and prophets in their spirit. Paul was among those who received this revelation of the mystery. There are a total of twenty-seven books in the New Testament, and fourteen of these books, from Romans to Hebrews, were written by Paul. He wrote over half the books of the New Testament. In these fourteen Epistles Paul elaborated and developed this mystery. He spoke of &ldquo;the stewardship of the grace of God&rdquo; (Eph. 3:2). The word translated &ldquo;stewardship&rdquo; in this verse is the same word in Greek as the word translated &ldquo;economy&rdquo; in 1:10 and 3:9. A person who has a stewardship must be full of God&rsquo;s economy and plan. This economy is the stewardship.</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you, that by revelation the mystery was made known to me&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). Paul received a revelation from God. God revealed the mystery, which had been hidden in Himself throughout the ages, to Paul. God did not tell this mystery to the angels or anyone else. It was not until God found Paul that He opened the secret hidden in His heart through revelation. Paul used fourteen Epistles to write concerning this indescribable mystery.</p>
<p>Paul called this mystery &ldquo;the mystery of Christ&rdquo; (v. 4), which is the church. When we say that the mystery of God is Christ, we mean that God is in Christ and that Christ is the embodiment of God. To say that the mystery of Christ is the church means that Christ is in the church and that the church is the embodiment of Christ. A person who wants to find God must find Christ, and a person who wants to find Christ must find the church. Today God is in Christ, and Christ is in the church. This is the mystery of Christ. We may not be fully able to explain this matter, but it is a crucial point in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Announcing the Unsearchable Riches<br />
of Christ to Men</h2>
<p>God revealed the mystery to Paul and gave him a stewardship to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to the Gentiles (v. 8). This is a very significant word. How much of the riches of Christ do we know? How much have we tasted? His riches are unsearchable and indescribable. In order to describe the riches of a wealthy man, we need to know his assets. A person&rsquo;s assets are his riches. How many riches does Christ possess? The first item of the riches of Christ is that He is the embodiment of God. Christ being the embodiment of God means that He is God. Who is richer than God?</p>
<p>The second item of the riches of Christ is that He is man. In order to know the true God, we must know Christ, and in order to know a true man, we must also know Christ. We should consider whether we are true. There is no one on this earth who has not told a lie; no one is honest. We are not even honest with our parents. How often have we deceived our parents? If we are honest, we will confess that we have deceived our parents, spouse, and children; hence, we are not honest or genuine. No one is true.</p>
<p>In human history there has been only one honest person&mdash;Jesus Christ. When He was seized before His crucifixion, He underwent six trials. Three times He was tried according to the Old Testament law and judged by the Jewish high priests Annas and Caiaphas and by the Sanhedrin (John 18:13; Matt. 26:57; Luke 22:66). He was also tried three times according to Roman law and judged by Herod and by Pilate (23:1-25). Eventually, Pilate said that he found no fault in Him (John 19:4; Luke 23:22). In other words, Pilate found no error or falsehood in the Lord Jesus. Who among men could pass through such examinations? We would not have needed six trials to prove that we are at fault. One trial would have been sufficient. Only Jesus Christ could stand in front of everyone and say, &ldquo;Which of you convicts Me of sin?&rdquo; (John 8:46).</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the true God and a true man. He is rich. I once made a list of the riches of Christ according to the Bible. Jesus Christ is God, man, life, light, holiness, righteousness, sanctification, love, grace, and so many other items. He is over two hundred and seventy items. He is every positive item. He is the sun, the air, food, water, and the best drink. He is whatever we need. He is our patience, our love, and our obedience. He is God, and He is man. He became a man to be our Redeemer and our Savior. He also became the life-giving Spirit. He is the light of life, and this light is full of the elements of grace, righteousness, and holiness. He is the glory of God and every human virtue. We are false; only Christ is true. Our humility is false; only Christ is real humility. Every human virtue is a shadow; only Christ is the reality. Christ is so rich.</p>
<p>When Paul announced the gospel, he did not announce doctrine; he announced a person. Paul announced the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. We should do the same today. We should announce Christ everywhere around the world. Christ is living, true, all-inclusive, deep, and vast. He is rich, and He is everything.</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a parent. People want children, but they do not know how difficult it is to be a parent until after they have children. It is easier to deal with other people than with our own children. It is most difficult for parents to deal with their children. Therefore, I would like to inform the parents that you need Christ. When you have Christ, you will know how to deal with your children. Christ is our wisdom in dealing with our children. When we have Him, we have wisdom, because He is wisdom. Furthermore, He is our life and ability so that we not only know how to deal with our children but also have the ability to deal with them. We need Christ. He is everything that we need in our daily living.</p>
<p>Paul announced Christ in such a way. Paul did not talk about doctrines; he announced Christ and also delivered Christ. To tell you how nutritious a drink is and how it can quench your thirst is like announcing doctrines. But if I deliver the drink to you, you can enjoy its nutrients by drinking. Paul delivered the riches of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
