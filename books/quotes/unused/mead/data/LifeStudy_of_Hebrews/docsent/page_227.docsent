   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NORMAL LIVING OF THE WONDERFUL ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Christ came into us, He brought His wonderful nature into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The function of this nature is the working of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is also in us as the ointment which constantly anoints us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This anointing gives us a comfortable, soothing sense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever the Lord Jesus teaches us from within, His teaching is that of His anointing which gives us this comfortable, soothing sense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Christians, we all have the automatic, spontaneous, constant, and instant working of the law of life, the law which works according to Christ s wonderful nature, and we have the anointing which moves in us according to Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us use the illustration of shopping once again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Going shopping is like going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After not going shopping for more than two years, I recently had to shop for a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the store I saw some very fancy lamps, but my wonderful nature did not like them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those lamps were bitter to my taste.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the other lamps were like garlic to my inner taste, and my inner sense could not tolerate them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the sisters are in a department store, many times their inner taste forbids them to purchase a particular item.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This taste comes from the wonderful nature within them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fifty years ago, I might have been able to purchase a fancy lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if I did this today, I would be unable to sleep at night because of the function of the nature of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have this nature with its automatic function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you try to suppress this function, it will spring up all the more, for the more it is suppressed, the higher it rises.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have experienced this working of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have seen, we not only have this nature within us, but also a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether I should go shopping today does not depend upon the working of the nature; it depends upon the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A living Person is constantly living and moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This living and moving is His teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are about to go shopping, we should open ourselves to the Lord, saying, Lord, I m one with You, and I know that You are one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, do You want to go shopping this morning?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we do this, we shall sense the anointing within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the moving of the living One within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As this lovable One works in us, we sense the comforting and the soothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How pleasant this is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether or not we go shopping is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The primary thing is that as we look to Him and fellowship with Him, we enjoy His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever we are under His anointing, we know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we take a step which He does not want to take, the anointing will stop, and the soothing, comforting sense will diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this we know that we should not do that particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At such a time we should say, Lord, I m one with You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If You don t want to go, I won t go either.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do this, the anointing and its comforting sense will return.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The living and moving of the anointing is Christ s inward teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have a living Person in us teaching us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes in our fellowship with the saints we may sense that the inner anointing has stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we have this sense, we should stop talking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You might have spoken half a sentence, but, sensing that the anointing has ceased, you should not speak the remainder of that sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Simply be one with the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many times, however, we disregard the anointing and do whatever we want.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was young, I told the Lord a number of times, Lord, please forgive me and let me do this just one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later I said to Him, Lord, let me do it just once more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of the young people have done the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some sisters might have said, Lord, I know that You don t want me to go shopping, but let me go this one time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever you do this, you kill yourself, and it may be several days before you are living again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What we are talking about here is neither a matter of teaching nor of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is the normal living of this wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I live absolutely according to the law of life, and I move, act, and behave according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not need anyone to teach me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The wonderful nature of the life of Christ and the very anointing of the Person of Christ are more than adequate for us to live a normal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we have fellowship and here we grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here we have the spreading of the indwelling Christ into every part of our being and we undergo the process of God s transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we also have the church life and the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And here we prepare ourselves for the Lord s coming back.</S>
