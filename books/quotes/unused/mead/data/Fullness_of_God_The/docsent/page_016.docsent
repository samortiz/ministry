   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Truth Needing Reality and Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I spoke on the word reality many years ago in Taiwan, I did not give much stress to the matter of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, after further study, I feel that we need both teachings and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Merely having reality without teaching does not constitute the truth, nor does having teachings without reality constitute the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The truth must have both reality and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, even though Confucius taught benevolence and righteousness, this teaching does not contain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, this teaching is merely doctrine because he could not give the reality of benevolence or righteousness to people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Confucius did not say, I am benevolence and righteousness ; neither did philosophers such as Socrates and Plato say this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout human history there was only one person who said, I am John 8:24, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He spoke of life, He said, I am the...life 11:25 , and when He spoke of truth, He said, I am the...reality, which is, I am the...truth 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus Giving People Reality</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teachings of Confucius concerning the way of the highest learning, developing the bright virtue, loving people, and attaining supreme goodness are doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In contrast, in the New Testament the Lord Jesus did not teach just doctrine; He also gave people reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not say only that we should love other people as we love ourselves; He declared that we should abide in His love 15:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, He is the reality of our love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems as if the Lord was saying, Receive My words and understand them, but if you want to obtain the reality in My words, you must gain Me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus is the Word becoming flesh to tabernacle among us that we may be full of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus did not merely speak doctrine; He was the reality of what He spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He spoke of love, and He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He spoke of truth, and He is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The disciples of Confucius could say only that they received the teachings of Confucius and that they improved their behavior according to his teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Confucius never said to his disciples, If you do not have me, these teachings are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You need to open yourselves and let me enter into you, because I am the reality of these teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Confucius did not have this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He could not say this, because he was neither life nor the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he could not enter into men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the end of Revelation, the end of the entire Bible, He said, Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we drink the Lord by drinking the water of life, we have the truth and also the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have received the reality; the truth is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything that is written in a recipe is theory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, when someone prepares a delicious meal according to a recipe and puts it on the table for everyone to enjoy, the recipe becomes a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we need not only doctrine but also reality, the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Doctrine and Reality Being in the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 1:14 says that the Lord Jesus is full of grace and reality truth .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 17 says, The law was given through Moses; grace and reality truth came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These verses do not contain teaching; they contain reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 17:17, however, the Lord Jesus said, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word includes teachings, but in this verse the Lord says that the word of God is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that the word of God contains not only teachings but also reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us look at another verse: You shall be holy because I am holy 1 Pet 1:16; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lev 11:44; 19:2; 20:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse contains doctrine as well as reality, because God said that He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The doctrine of sanctification cannot sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only the Lord, the reality of sanctification, can sanctify people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Seemingly, the word is composed of teachings, but within the word is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the word of God can sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not only need to receive the word; we also need to gain the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament puts the word and the Lord together, as in John 1:1: In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The words in the Bible are not the same as the words of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The words of Confucius are merely words, but the words in the Bible are not merely words; they contain reality, and this reality is God Himself.</S>
