   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 4:1-4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The advocates of this school think that 1 Revelation 2 and 3 refer to today's church age, 2 Revelation 4:1 refers to the church, 3 the twenty-four elders in Revelation 4:4 signify the church's being raptured and glorified, and 4 Revelation 5 and 6 then go on to mention the beginning of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Revelation 4:1 does not address the whole church; it addresses only John when it says, "Come up here."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is an accomplished fact that occurred on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, Philip's being caught away in Acts 8:39 would indicate that he also was raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As to the twenty-four elders being the glorified church, this is truly nonsensical because: 1 Twenty-four is not the number of the church, but seven and multiples of seven are numbers referring to the church for example, the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 There is no place in the Bible where elders signify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church and among the Jews there are elders, but not every believer is an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God first created the angels, then selected the Jews, and finally gave grace to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can elders be taken to be the church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3 In Revelation 4 and 5 the elders are sitting on thrones and are crowned with crowns of gold, and Christ is standing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the thrones and crowns of gold are symbols of kingship, can it be that the church was glorified before Christ was glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4 Some say that the white robes that the elders wear refer to the righteousness of the Lord, and that they were washed in the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in the Bible there is no record that says that the robes of the elders were washed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of sin our robes need to be washed white by the precious blood, but the twenty-four elders never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>5 These elders never sang the song of salvation for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter four they sang of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter five they did sing the song of salvation, but they were not referring to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were referring to the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Several versions of the Bible translate the passage in verse 9 as "redeemed us."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This translation is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word "us" should be "men."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is absurd for the church to sing a song referring to God saving others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>6 Revelation 4 does not speak concerning the church, the Gentiles, or the Jews, but refers to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the elders there are the elders of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is not the elders of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>7 According to Revelation 5:8 the church cannot bring man's prayer to the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>8 In Revelation 7:13, if John also is part of the church, then it becomes the church asking the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>9 Since John addressed the elders as "Sir," or "My lord," obviously John's position is inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the twenty-four elders are the church, since John is a patriarch, he would be the elder among the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>10 The number twenty-four is interpreted literally; it is not a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since one among the elders spoke with John, how could one twenty-fourth of the church speak with John?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the number is fixed, the elders also are fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The twenty-four elders are in fact the archangels who govern the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even under Satan there are princes and rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>D. These say, "Do not 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 refer to the rapture?" Of course they refer to the rapture, but they do not say at what time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They mention the fact of the rapture but not the time of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This cannot prove that the rapture is before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>E. First Corinthians 15:50-52 shows that both the dead and the living will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This refers to the fact of the rapture, but it does not say that the rapture will be before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, it proves that the rapture will be after the tribulation, at the time of the last trumpet, which equals the seventh trumpet in Revelation 11:15.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some say that according to the Roman custom, the trumpet was blown three times, and therefore the last trumpet would be the third trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is wrong, because the Holy Spirit does not borrow the Roman way in giving revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no connection and it is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>F. These argue that in Luke 21:36 the Lord clearly promised that the church can escape the great tribulation and "stand before the Son of Man," which, to them, is the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But here this promise is conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not conditioned on salvation by regeneration; it is conditioned on watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one is accounted worthy after he watches and waits, it becomes a promise conditioned on watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not everyone in the whole church is watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>G. Revelation 3:10 is, for these ones, the strongest reason.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But here it is also a conditional promise.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One cannot say that, based on this, all will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the church not everyone will follow the word of the endurance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What does "the word of My endurance" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today men revile the Lord, curse Him, and deny Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet the Lord does not send lightning from heaven to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord does not punish them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the word of the endurance of Christ in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we endure together with Christ; we do not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is it really possible that everyone keeps this word of endurance?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If this is so, then all the believers can be raptured; if it is not so, then not all the believers can be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And if this is the argument, then it follows that the whole world will be saved according to John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But they forget the condition in John 3:16, "every one who believes into Him."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The promise of the Lord here in Revelation 3:10 was to the whole church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They say that since Philadelphia is a representation of the church, the whole church will therefore be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time in Asia Minor there were the seven churches, but this promise of the Lord was spoken only to one of the seven.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, Philadelphia cannot represent all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Otherwise, the overcomers in the other six churches could not be raptured and would have no hope of being saved from the tribulation.</S>
