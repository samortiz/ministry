To understand the Old Testament, you need to keep one principle; and to understand the New Testament, you need to keep another principle. Today, the Pentecostals, like those in Catholicism, understand the Bible in a mixed-up way. They do not keep the principle of the Old Testament and of the New Testament. When you apply anything of the Old Testament, you must find out the principle of applying it in a spiritual way, not in a physical way.</P><P>This is the difference between the practice of Judaism and the practice of God's New Testament economy. The Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, has become an idol to the religious Jews. They do not really care for God in reality but for the letter of their Torah. Even the ark became a superstitious thing to the children of Israel. When they were fighting the Philistines, they brought out the ark to go with them. Eventually, they were defeated and the ark was captured (1 Sam. 4:3-5, 10-11). The children of Israel also built the temple, and the temple eventually became an idol to them. They trusted in the temple rather than in God Himself. Later, the Babylonians came to destroy the temple.</P><P>The two lines of the Bible are the line of life and the line of the knowledge of good and evil. With these two lines, there are the principles of the Bible. As long as it is something other than God, whether good or evil, that is not life. Only God Himself is the tree of life.</P><P>Today people are claiming their rights, but they are violating the God-ordained principles. Paul spoke of the distinctions between male and female in his Epistles (1 Cor. 11:2-15; 1 Tim. 2:9-15). Deuteronomy 22:5 says, "A woman shall not put on a man's belongings, nor shall a man wear a woman's garment; for everyone who does these things is an abomination to Jehovah your God." For a woman to wear a man's clothing or for a man to wear a woman's clothing breaks God's principle. We have to keep the principles. Every part, chapter, paragraph, sentence, and clause of the Bible must be interpreted according to the proper principles.</P><P>According to the principle in the Old Testament, the Old Testament saints had to keep the Sabbath, the seventh day. But when the Lord Jesus came, He ended the Old Testament time. To end means to conclude and to consummate. Christ consummated, concluded, ended, the Old Testament. Now according to the book of Hebrews, Christ is everything. In the New Testament, Christ is our Sabbath (Mark 2:27-28; Col. 2:16-17).</P><P>Now that we are in the New Testament age, we have to keep this principle concerning Christ. The principle in the Old Testament was to keep the Sabbath day. The principle in the New Testament concerning the Sabbath is to believe in the Lord, to rest in the Lord, and to enjoy the Lord. The Seventh-Day Adventists mix up the Old Testament principle with that of the New Testament. They keep the Old Testament Sabbath in the New Testament age. They are wrong in principle. Their intention might be good, but their principle is wrong.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 70</div><br></body></html>
