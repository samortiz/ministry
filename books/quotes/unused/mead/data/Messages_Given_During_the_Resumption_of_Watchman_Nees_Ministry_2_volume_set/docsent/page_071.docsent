   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO SERVING BY THE WHOLE BODY CONFERENCE 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Evening, January 19, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading:Phil 1 PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN COORDINATION,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WITH EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gospel preaching is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is quite a demanding work, and we cannot consider it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I can testify that before every gospel meeting, I have to speak to the brothers and sisters at least twice, to let every one enter the burden of the gospel before we actually preach to the outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today the gospel is preached by the church, and everyone has a part in it; everyone can give themselves to this work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, this does not mean that everyone can deliver a message on the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet in the work of gospel preaching, the delivering of the message occupies only a small part of the various responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other responsibilities rest with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of gospel preaching will not put the burden on the shoulders of one person only.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a big difference between a gospel preaching that is done in coordination and one that is done individually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every time, before I deliver a gospel message, all the brothers and sisters first do their part in inviting their friends and making all the preparations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am like one who sits on a sedan chair; there is no need for me to do much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the message, everything is handled by the brothers and sisters also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can go home and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of coordination does not put the burden on the shoulders of one person alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, it becomes the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Chefoo, during the New Year, none of the brothers and sisters would celebrate the festival.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone prepares only simple meals.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some brothers and sisters only cook once in the morning and eat leftovers for lunch and dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some who come from distant localities bring their own food with them, while the church provides only water and tea for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Other brothers and sisters would invite gospel friends to eat at their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Chinese New Year festival is very much related to superstitious practices and idol worshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, during the New Year season, all the illegal and sinful things are done in the open.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this demonic festival, theatrical groups would be set up in front of the idol temples and would sing to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In spite of all these activities, every time we preach the gospel, we gain many people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In preaching the gospel, as long as we are one, we will see many people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Tsingtao, our number was originally quite small, about one hundred thirty brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After I worked there for two months, from April 15 to June 15, we had an increase of two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Originally we did not have a baptistry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later a baptistry was built in a brother's home, and the church began baptizing people every month.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here in Swatow, you have about three hundred brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are in one accord, by the end of this year you should have one thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if you argue with one another and divide yourselves into five or six groups, the number will surely decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have a burden in my heart, which is that the church here should preach the gospel in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the matter of gospel preaching, I hope that the church would learn to mobilize everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The main emphasis is not merely the saving of the sinners, but the oneness among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you do this, the number of saved ones will increase all the time.</S>
