   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER SOURCE THE SERPENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, Genesis 2:9 also reveals a source other than God the evil one, Satan, the adversary of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil has its source in Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 1 the significant words are image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 2 the significant word is life, the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's image and dominion require God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three image, dominion, and life are very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 3 there is another important but very negative word the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After two positive chapters, suddenly the serpent comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and scribes, calling them serpents and the brood of vipers Matt 23:33; 12:34 , He did not speak in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was saying that Satan was a serpent and they were all the offspring of the serpent; Satan was the father, and they were all his children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their father was the serpent; therefore, they belonged to the serpent family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus also told the Pharisees that their father was the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Pharisees claimed that Abraham was their father, but the Lord Jesus said that if Abraham were their father, they would have done the works of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He told them that their father was not Abraham, but the serpent, the Devil, the father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The serpent came into man first by tempting him to take his thought.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God had told Adam and Eve not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lest they die Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the serpent came in to raise a question: "Did God say?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you look at a question mark, you will see that it resembles a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When that little serpent rears up his head and questions you, he looks like a question mark.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The satanic, serpentine thought first entered the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, the man stretched forth his hand and ate of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the serpent, the evil one, entered the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, Satan entered man's mind; second, he came into man's physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this, the human mentality is awful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His mind is evil and terrible because it has been fully occupied by the evil serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Also, the human body has been corrupted with all kinds of lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible tells us that the lusts are in man's physical body Gal 5:24; James 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man's body has become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was created by God as a body, but after it was poisoned and corrupted by Satan, it became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The created body was good, clean, and pure; the flesh is evil, dirty, corrupt, and full of lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan came into man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, man now has a defiled body and a corrupted mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Satan came into man, man not only became sinful, but his inward constitution was also corrupted with the satanic element.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both the outward conduct and the inward nature were defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need many negative words to describe this corrupted man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All that man is and does is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether he loves or hates, man is full of the poisonous element of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man has been inwardly constituted with Satan and has become a satanic thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man has been mixed with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is still man, but man mixed with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man was mixed with Satan to such an extent that the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees serpents Matt 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Apparently human beings are still men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They appear to be ladies and gentlemen as they walk down the street.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, in the eyes of God, they are serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not a matter of outward conduct; it is absolutely a matter of the inward element, the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 3:14 shows us that the brass serpent in the wilderness was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole so that the people who were poisoned by the fiery serpents might be saved Num 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brass serpent on the pole typified the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He was on the cross, He was in the form of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In like manner, the brass serpent had only the form of a serpent; it did not have the nature or the poison of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the cross the Lord Jesus took the form of the serpent because he died for man who had become a serpent in his inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the eyes of God mankind had become serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apparently man was still man; actually he was a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, when the Lord Jesus died as the substitute for all the serpentine people, He was in the form of the serpent.</S>
