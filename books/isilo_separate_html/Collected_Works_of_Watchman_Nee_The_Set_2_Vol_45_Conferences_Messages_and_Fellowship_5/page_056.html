At that time I was not very knowledgeable concerning the prophecies, and I wrote about them in a very brief way. I attached to it a preface and sent it to the printer. I felt very good about it and did not have much regret about printing it. Moreover, I received over three hundred responses from readers telling me that they had liked it and received help, encouragement, and admonition from it. I felt quite proud of myself. One day, as I was with Miss Barber, I asked, "Have you received a copy of The Christian that I edited? What do you think of its content?" She was not interested in this at all, talking only about her tea and cakes. I tried a few more times to draw her attention to my magazine, but she kept on talking about tea, cakes, and candies. When I was about to leave, she said one word to me, "Brother, one day you will discover that good things are not necessarily good." I asked if she was referring to the second issue of The Christian, and she said yes. She continued, saying, "If I had to put out ten issues of The Christian, I would not put those things in one of them. I would write on something else." At that time I did not appreciate what she said. But day after day, I began to realize that it is not how much we can produce and achieve, but how much God has done. Everything that issues from man is futile, whether it is human wisdom or human power.</p><p>One time I took a sister to visit Miss Barber. The sister did something wrong, and after Miss Barber spoke with her, she cried from morning until the afternoon. I went back and asked Miss Barber, "Do you know that she has been crying?" I thought that her repentance was wonderful. But after Miss Barber heard my word, her reaction was very cold. I tried my best to describe how repentant the sister was, but Miss Barber replied, "She is pitying herself! I do not like to help this kind of person." At that time I could not quite take these words. I felt that Miss Barber was compassionless, uncaring, and unsympathetic toward others. But after a year or two I found that she was right. I thought that repentance, tears, weeping, and remorse for one's own sins were the right things to have. But she was able to discriminate between good and evil. This is not a matter of criticism or compassion, but a matter of seeing or not seeing. The one who had the vision had the spiritual knowledge of good and evil, but I did not have it.</p><p>Once I took over sixty co-workers to see Miss Barber. She said "If five or six from among these ones remain to follow the Lord, we should be thankful and praise the Lord." In reflecting on her words today, I can see that it is just about that number that are still following the Lord in a genuine way.</p><p>Miss Barber possessed this spiritual ability to discriminate between good and evil. The good and evil that I am speaking of here are different from the good and evil that ordinary men speak of. In many instances what is good and evil to man may be exactly the opposite in the eyes of God. Those who are good at criticizing others often have a wrong spirit. But those who have the knowledge of good and evil have the right eyes for things. Because their eyes have seen the light, their words are a kind of spiritual discernment rather than a kind of criticism.</p><p>I appreciate Brother Austin-Sparks because he also has such a spiritual ability to discriminate between good and evil. One man lived together with me for a few months; however, Brother Austin-Sparks seldom saw him. Yet he knew this man more than I did. We are not here to criticize others. Those who criticize others will not have God's blessings. But we do need a kind of spiritual discernment. Our knowledge of good and evil should not only be applied to people, but should be applied to things as well. Many times in making judgments on things, those who have the light can tell the difference between good and evil. Those who have seen the light do not even need to seek after God's will; they are already clear about God's will within themselves.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO THE SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE<br />OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Word</h2><p>Genesis 3 and Hebrews 4 and 5 are three places in the Bible that speak of the knowledge of good and evil. The discriminating between good and evil in Hebrews 5 is spiritual; it is a mark of maturity. Hebrews 4 tells us how we can discriminate between good and evil, and where the power of discrimination lies. Only God can discriminate between good and evil because all things are laid bare before His eyes and cannot be hidden. There are many things which are unknown to man, but God says that those who are spiritual can discern all things (1 Cor. 2:15). This is what Hebrews 4 speaks of. God's word can divide and cut asunder man's soul and spirit, discerning the true nature of things. Soulish ones criticize others and exercise their mind to split hairs over small things. But spiritual things can be known only in an inward way. A person must first be dealt with. Before he can have a clear vision before God concerning all things, he must first have God's word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
