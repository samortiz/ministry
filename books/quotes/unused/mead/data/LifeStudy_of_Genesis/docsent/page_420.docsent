   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO BEING DEALT WITH 6 11 The Stone with Oil Poured upon It</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob's dream is the most crucial point in the whole book of Genesis 28:10-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not even 1:26 is as crucial as Jacob's dream in chapter twenty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One of the most striking aspects of this dream is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After traveling on a long journey, Jacob, being tired and lonesome, took a stone, made it his pillow, and slept in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This might have been the first time in history that a man used a stone for a pillow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you ever laid your head upon a stone for rest?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have never done this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly, Jacob made that stone a pillow; secondly, he set it up for a pillar 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A pillow is for resting and a pillar is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you realize that one day your pillow will become a pillar?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later we shall see what this pillow is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 28:22 Jacob said, "This stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to the stone, the pillar, and the house, there was the oil poured upon the top of the stone 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How could Jacob, a lonesome wanderer, have had oil with him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, early in the morning, he poured oil upon the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, in this dream there are four basic elements: the stone, the pillar, the house, and the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These four items are the basic factors with which the Bible is composed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have mentioned several times, God's intention is to make man His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the book of Genesis we cannot see that God obtained such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1:26, a declaration of God's purpose in making man, we are told that man was made in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But here we do not see that God gained His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not have His expression with Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, or Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we come to Jacob, we see that he was a supplanter, a heel-holder, a very crafty young man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under the light of the whole Bible, we know that this young supplanter was chosen by God and was predestinated to have the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before the foundation of the world, in eternity past, God predestinated him to have the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have pointed out, the birthright includes three things: expressing God as priests, representing Him as kings, and inheriting God's inheritance as heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This birthright is absolutely for the corporate expression of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The events in Genesis 28 occurred approximately twenty-two centuries after the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God called Abraham approximately two thousand years after the creation of Adam, and the period of time from Abraham until Jacob was about two hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During this long period of time, God did not obtain what He desired.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While Jacob, the young supplanter who had gotten into trouble due to his supplanting, was on his lonesome journey, he had a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What Jacob saw was a dream; it was not yet a fact, because Jacob was still a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Deep within, he was probably still holding on to Esau's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How could such a supplanter be the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, at that time, Jacob's dream was only a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, although it is impossible for us to land on the moon right now, we may dream that we have landed on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This may be a dream, but it is not a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to have dreams in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have had a number of dreams in the past and I would like to have another one today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have had no dreams since you were saved, your situation must be most pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How many dreams have you had since you were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every spiritual vision is a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the significance of a dream?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The principle of a dream is that in it something impossible happens to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our being saved was a dream, the initial dream in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although getting saved was an impossibility, we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Coming into the church life was also a spiritual dream.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone who has come into the church life has had a dream in which something impossible took place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I like these heavenly dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we have seen in Jacob's heavenly dream four things were revealed: the stone, the pillar, the house, and the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These four things are rarely found before Genesis 28.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For instance, apart from the onyx stone in 2:12 no stone is mentioned in the foregoing twenty-seven and a half chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we do find mention of the bricks used for building the devilish city and demonic tower of Babel 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we were studying chapter eleven, we pointed out that bricks signify human work, the issue of human effort with clay.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every religion is represented by bricks, for every religion is a human effort with clay.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Mankind is clay, and religion works upon mankind to produce bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No pillar is mentioned before Genesis twenty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the Bible speaks of the city and tower of Babel, no pillars are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not think that the Bible is common.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not common; rather, it is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the temple constructed by Solomon there were two great pillars 1 Kings 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Galatians 2:9 we are told that Peter, James, and John were pillars of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Moreover, in Revelation 3:12 we see that the overcomers will be built as pillars into the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Like the pillar, neither the house nor the oil is mentioned prior to chapter twenty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all lived in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But after having his dream at Bethel, Jacob did not speak of a tent; he spoke of God's house.</S>
