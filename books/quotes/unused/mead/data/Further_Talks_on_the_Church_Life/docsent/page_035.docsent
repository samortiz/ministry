   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For a clearer understanding, I will give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows that God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's Gen 4:2-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Cain was a farmer and cultivated the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what his father did when he was in the Garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When his father tilled the soil in the Garden of Eden, he brought the produce of the land and offered it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though Cain was outside the Garden of Eden because of sin, he tilled the soil as before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He received produce from the land as before, and he offered it to God as before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God not only refused to accept him, but also was displeased with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people ask, "Why?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very simple and has but one significance: What man did before he sinned was acceptable to God, but nothing can be worse before God than to do the same thing after man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose that at eight o'clock each evening a child wants his mother to prepare a snack for him before he goes to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But one day he causes some trouble, and his mother has to apologize and pay for damages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What would happen if he asked his mother to prepare a snack for him as usual as though nothing had occurred?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the child had been crying and was upset over his actions, you might not feel too bad.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if he acts as if nothing has happened, you would feel very bad.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a child is not bothered after making trouble, when he grows up he may even kill people and not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Cain was just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What he had done before, he continued to do in the same way after having sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He continued to offer things to God as though nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He considered committing sin a small matter; he did not think it was anything serious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abel was accepted because he acknowledged that he was outside the Garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His offering acknowledged that he had sinned and that his present situation was different from what it had been in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are afraid of frivolous people like Cain; this kind of people cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They say, "We are in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The denominations were not formed by us; they were formed by our forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We bear some responsibility in them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot say, Good!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us be united tomorrow.'</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What about the denominations we are in?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants the church to be united, but denominations divide it!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When one begins to be conscious that it is wrong to be divided in this way, he must confess that this is wrong before God; he must tear it down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He should say, "O God, although this denomination was not formed by me but by my forefathers, I am sinful as long as I am a part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not just a personal matter; it involves the whole church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today I would ask You to tear it down; today I would declare that there is something wrong in it."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the right way to act.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose I form a denomination and afterwards realize that something is wrong and try to ameliorate it by saying, "Let us have fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am afraid of this kind of frivolous and light-minded behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Cain's behavior, not condemning sin after he had sinned but trying to repair the situation instead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is very unchristian.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers, are you clear?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think it is all right to not condemn but only attempt to repair it after you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is never the expression of God's life!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, suppose I offend a brother by speaking many things behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should I do when I am rebuked by God's light?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, I must go to him and confess my sin: "Brother, I have sinned against you by speaking many things to undermine you behind your back.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please accept my apology."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then it is right for me to express some love to him the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What if a man sins against you, steals many things from you, speaks against you, and then behaves as if nothing has happened?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He does not confess his sin at all, but turns around to treat you well and to send gifts to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How would you feel about him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We Christians do have a way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have done something wrong, we cannot change a little without confessing our mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not right to act this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not the way before God to solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such a person should come to you and confess, "Brother, I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I owe you money, and I owe you other things."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He must first confess his sin before he can show his love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the principle by which a Christian may be restored.</S>
