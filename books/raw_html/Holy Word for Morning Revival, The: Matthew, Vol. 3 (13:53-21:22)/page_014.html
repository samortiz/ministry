<p class="bold">WEEK 12 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 16:24-27</h2><p class="bold">24 &nbsp;Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him <sup>1</sup>deny <sup>2</sup>himself and take up his cross and follow Me.</p> <p class="bold">25 &nbsp;For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever <sup>1</sup>loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.</p><p class="bold">26 &nbsp;For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his <sup>1</sup>soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?</p><p>27 &nbsp;For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>24<sup>1</sup> To deny our self is to forfeit our soul-life, the natural life (v. 26; Luke 9:25).</p><p>24<sup>2</sup> Three terms in vv. 23-25 are related to one another: mind, himself, and soul-life. Our mind is the expression of our self, and our self is the embodiment of our soul-life. Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion. When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened with Peter. Hence, the Lord’s subsequent word indicated that Peter had to deny himself, i.e., not save his soul-life but lose it. Losing the soul-life is the reality of denying the self. This is to take up the cross.</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. If the heavenly King’s followers allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the King’s sake, they will enable their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King’s joy in ruling over the earth (25:21, 23).</p><p>26<sup>1</sup> In Luke 9:24-25 soul-life is replaced with himself, indicating that our soul-life is our self.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>I have learned to be afraid of my opinions. During the years, I have been enlightened to see that the natural opinion or concept is the incarnation of Satan. If this were not so, how could the Lord Jesus have rebuked Peter and called him Satan? The first time I read this in the Bible, I was shocked. In verse 23 Peter and Satan had become one in Peter’s selfish opinion. Peter’s opinion was Satan.</p><p>Nothing damages your Christian life more than your opinions.</p><p>The cross is not merely a suffering; it is also a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, first were crucified with Him and now bear the cross. To us, to bear the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man. In so doing we deny our self that we may follow the Lord.…Ultimately, the pathway to glory is a matter of being terminated.…Resurrection follows termination. When we keep ourselves under Christ’s termination, spontaneously there will be a reaction in our spirit. This reaction is resurrection.…Before the Lord’s crucifixion the disciples followed Him in an outward way. But now, after His resurrection, we follow Him in an inward way. Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) dwelling in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), we follow Him in our spirit (Gal. 5:16-25).</p><p>The word “For” at the beginning of [Matt. 16:27] indicates that the Lord’s rewarding of His followers at His coming back…will be according to whether they lose or save their soul, as mentioned in verses 25 and 26. The reward will be given according to how we have borne the cross.
