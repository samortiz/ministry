<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Most people in Christianity completely ignore this kind of truth. They focus only on the outward practices and neglect the inward reality. For example, in wedding ceremonies the pastor often teaches the wife to be subject to her husband and the husband to love his wife, and both the bridegroom and the bride nod their heads in agreement. Then they go on their honeymoon. Perhaps on the third day, the wife thinks to herself that her husband is unreasonable and wonders how she can be subject to him? The husband may feel that his wife is inconsiderate, but on the first day he restrains his anger and says nothing. He continues to grit his teeth on the second day, but on the third day he can no longer stand it and loses his temper. If we give people only doctrines without giving them the life supply, they will be powerless.</p>
<p>We can never be subject to our husbands or love our wives by ourselves. If we try to do this, we will definitely lose our temper by the third day. We have to realize that since we are Christians, we have the Lord Jesus in us. He is our life because He is the Spirit of life indwelling us. When our husband or wife gives us a difficult time, we should not look at them, because at that time they will seem very ugly. Rather, we should turn to the Lord and behold Him. We should not try to reason with our husbands or wives but should talk to the Lord Jesus inwardly. We can tell the Lord that if He had not given us our husband or wife, we would not have married him or her, but since He did, He should see how unreasonable they are. I believe that as long as we have a little conversation with the Lord, our anger will be dissipated. After He has completely dissipated our anger and infused us with His fragrance, we will surely be filled with joy. Eventually, not only will we not be angry with our husband or wife, but we will also love them very much.</p>
<p>We all know this truth, but unfortunately, most of the time in our practical daily life it is not Christ who lives but we who are living. When our spouse stares at us angrily, we stare back at him or her. At these times, we forget that we are Christians. We are living instead of Christ. When this happens, we should not be surprised and ask how we could lose our temper so badly. Our &ldquo;I&rdquo; is no good; it is a gopher, a scorpion, and a serpent. This is why our living is so weak and feeble. Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #499 says, &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace! / The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives. / With Him I have been crucified; / This glorious fact to me He gives. / Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live, / But Christ the Lord within me lives.&rdquo; A couple may sing this hymn with uplifted spirits and resounding voices in the meeting, but once they go home, they may quarrel about the matter of opening or closing the windows. One may say, &ldquo;The air circulation is not good in the house, so it is better to open the windows.&rdquo; However, the other one may answer, &ldquo;We should close the windows, or else I may catch a cold.&rdquo; While they are arguing, their eyes look fiercer and fiercer. They have both forgotten that Christ is their life. Thus, it is no longer Christ who lives but the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who lives.</p>
 <p>I believe that in every Christian home there are many unnecessary things that should be given away. In the United States the department stores advertise their sales every Saturday, and many sisters love to read these advertisements. No matter how loudly they sing in the meeting&mdash;&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live, / But Christ the Lord within me lives&rdquo;&mdash; when they read the advertisements, it is &ldquo;no longer Christ but I.&rdquo; A sister may notice that her favorite fabric is being sold at a fifty percent discount and that she has a good amount of savings in her bank account. She may decide to drive to the store and buy it. At this time, the Lord may say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it. You have enough clothes already.&rdquo; However, she is still &ldquo;no longer Christ but I.&rdquo; When she arrives at the department store, the Lord may say again, &ldquo;Do not buy the fabric. Go home!&rdquo; Nevertheless she remains &ldquo;no longer Christ but I.&rdquo; After she enters the store, she may pick up a piece of fabric thinking that its color is beautiful and its quality is very good. At this time, the Lord may say again, &ldquo;Put it down and go home.&rdquo; However, she may reply, &ldquo;O Lord, please allow me just this once, and I will never do it again. Just allow me this one time to be no longer Christ but I.&rdquo; Many of us have experiences like this.</p>
<p>In how many of the things in our practical daily living can we definitely say, &ldquo;It is no longer I but Christ&rdquo;? Sometimes when the telephone rings, the sisters&rsquo; ears become attached to the telephone just like a piece of metal attracted to a magnet. They cannot get off the telephone until they have talked for half an hour to an hour. If you ask them to read a life-study message, they will excuse themselves by saying that they do not have time. If you ask them to pray over and read the Bible, they will say that they cannot do it because they are busy with their housework. It is actually not that difficult to experience Christ as life as long as we first converse with the Lord and fellowship with Him in every matter. He is not far from us; He is right inside of us. We should inquire of Him, &ldquo;Lord, what would You do? Do You want me to do that? If You will do it, I will do it with You. If You will not do it, I also will not do it.&rdquo; Then we will know what we should do immediately. This is to enjoy Christ as life and to enjoy God&rsquo;s nature. In this way we can experience the clear leading of Christ within us in every single matter. We will know that He does not want us to do this thing and that He also does not want us to do that thing. In the end, we will spontaneously live out love, light, holiness, and righteousness. In other words, God&rsquo;s divine attributes will be expressed in our human virtues. This is to live Christ and to express Christ.</p>
