   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OPPOSERS GLORIFY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE DAY OF VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 12 Peter is saying that if we have an excellent manner of life among the nations, they will eventually glorify God concerning us in the day of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse Peter seems to be telling the saints, The opposers now speak evil against you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if you live a life that is excellent among them, a life that is beautiful in quality and excellent in manner, they will observe your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As they look upon you, they will realize that you are under the visitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, the outcome will be a glory to God, for the opposers will glorify God in the day of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can testify that throughout the years I have seen Peter s word fulfilled many times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because they saw God s visitation of the saints, a good number of opposers regretted what they had done and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The saints were under God s loving care in the day of His visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though these saints were evil spoken of, they lived a marvelous, excellent life under God s gracious care.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, God visited them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their excellent manner of life and God s visitation eventually caused the opposers to repent and give glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of the young people in the Lord s recovery have been opposed by their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Several years ago, the parents of a particular young person may have opposed him strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They wondered why he spent so much time attending the meetings of the church and of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, gradually they began to see a change, a transformation, in his manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although they did not have the word to describe it, they were witnessing the Lord s transforming work in their son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, they came to realize that he was a person under God s care, a person under God s visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not long ago, a number of saints testified to this effect in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They said that in the past they were opposed by their parents and, in some cases, even persecuted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But gradually, over a period of time, the attitude of their parents began to change.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the young people went home to visit the family, their parents continued to oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But they also were carefully observing their children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Little by little, there was less opposition and more observation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the parents had a complete change in attitude, and in some cases, they also came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They observed the excellent manner of life of their children, and they glorified God in the day of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SUBJECT TO EVERY HUMAN INSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verses 13 and 14 Peter says, Be subject to every human institution for the Lord s sake, whether to a king as supreme, or to governors as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and praise of those who do good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What does the word institution mean?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Literally, the Greek word means creation, as in Colossians 1:15.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It refers to anything made, as a creature, building, regulation, ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The King James Version and the American Standard Version render this Greek word as ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Darby and the New American Standard Version translate it as institution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse the word institution means a regulation, an ordinance, an established principle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is difficult to find a proper English equivalent of the Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 13 institution means the making of regulations or ordinances much like the enacting of laws by the legislature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the context, every human institution includes a king as supreme and also governors as sent by him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here Peter is telling the believers that for the Lord s sake, that is, for the expression and glorification of the Lord v. 12 , we should be subject to all human institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 15 Peter goes on to say, Because so is the will of God, by doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The foolish men in verse 15 are the evil speakers mentioned in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>USING OUR FREEDOM AS SLAVES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 16 Peter says, As free, and not having freedom as a cloak for evil, but as slaves of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should never use freedom as an excuse to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not say, Are we not free?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not under the bondage of the law; we are under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that we are free.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, we are free, but we should not use our freedom as an excuse to behave in a careless manner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, we should use our freedom as slaves of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter s word here is similar to that of Paul in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although we are freed from the law of Moses, we are still under the law of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As those under the law of Christ, we should be slaves of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, we are free; on the other hand, we are slaves of God under His control.</S>
