   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION BECAUSE OF OUR JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is wonderful that Romans 3 tells us that we are justified freely through the blood of the Lord Jesus and that Romans 4 follows by telling us that because we are justified, the Lord Jesus was resurrected v. 25 . His death is the basis of our justification, while His resurrection is the proof of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since He died, we are justified; since we are justified, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are justified before God because of His death, and He was resurrected because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His resurrection is God's proof to us that His blood is able to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose someone were to ask if His blood is effective or not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no way to see the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot see the blood at all because the blood was put on the side posts and the upper post of the door Exo 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was brought into the Holy of Holies and put in the place of atonement for sin Lev 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was only for God to see.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We only know about the redemption of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not know how the blood of the Lord Jesus has satisfied God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter how much we know, we will never be clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the whole universe, only One knows the full value of the Lord's blood, and this One is God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God knows in full the value of the Lord Jesus' blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We only know it in part.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will never know it by our mind, our prayer, or our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not know why the blood of the Lord Jesus washes away all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can only say that He has died for us and for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We still do not know the value of the Lord's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God knows this value.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How does God show that the work of His Son is of great value?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How does God show that the propitiation sacrifice of His Son has indeed propitiated us?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He shows it by giving us the resurrection as a proof.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Resurrection proves that He is satisfied with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In resurrection, God is saying that He has approved the cross and that the cross has passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now God is presenting resurrection as an evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because God saw that the work of the Lord had fulfilled all the righteous requirements of God, everyone who comes to God is now justified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since God is satisfied, the Lord Jesus resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The illustration that we have given may not be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let me give you a more accurate illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us not say that I owe money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us say instead that I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this case a brother is not going to plead for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead he will bear my punishment, if there is such a thing in law as bearing others' punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have sinned and should be put in jail for three months or confined to manual labor for two or three months.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I have brain disease, heart disease, a lung problem, a kidney disorder, and all kinds of other sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, this brother is very healthy and is willing to be my substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When will I know that my case is over?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I should be the one to go to jail.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But he has gone in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although I have not spent one day in jail and although I am staying peacefully at home and can conduct my business as usual, as long as he is in jail, my heart is still not at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am worried that one day the judge may say that he cannot be my substitute and that I have to come myself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not until the day that he is released and walking on the street that I know that my case is over.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If my case was not yet over, he would not have been released.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we do not know what God has to say about this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I know that the Lord has come to redeem us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But how do I know that God will acknowledge this way of redemption as proper?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not know if the Lord's redemption is adequate or proper.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not know if the redemptive work of the Lord has been fully settled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But since the Lord came out from death, I realize that everything has been taken care of.</S>
