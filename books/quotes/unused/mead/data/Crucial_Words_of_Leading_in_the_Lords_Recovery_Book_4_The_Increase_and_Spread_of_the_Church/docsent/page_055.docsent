   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Coordinating with Neighboring Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In some homes there are only husbands and wives because all the children have left home.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, they may think that there is not enough support for them to preach the gospel in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In such a case, they can ask others who are nearby to join them; thus, they can have a gospel meeting with two or three families who live nearby.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will not cause the free nature of preaching the gospel at home to be lost, and at the same time, there will be more impact in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we need to combine our homes together, but we should not do this in a rigid way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not have fixed rules about the number of families that come together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should always be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following the Lord s Leading</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>to Have Specific Prayers</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easy for us to neglect to pray for our relatives, friends, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should follow the Lord s leading to petition specifically for the more hopeful ones to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all have some experience in praying for people, but many times our prayers are too general.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We ask the Lord to gospelize Taiwan, but we have little way to determine whether or not the Lord has heard our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we pray specifically for our relatives and friends one by one, we will pay attention to whether or not the Lord has heard our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, this is a very good opportunity for us to exercise our spirit and faith to see the Lord s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a great strengthening to our faith when we see a person turn and believe in the Lord after praying for him for many months.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not a heavy burden; it is an exercise as well as an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all should pray for our relatives, friends, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have too many relatives and friends, we need to have specific prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In their initial zeal some brothers and sisters write down a hundred names and make a determination to pray for them every day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the end, they do not pray for anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we do not need to focus on too many people at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The best way is to focus on three to five, always looking to the Lord for them in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The effect of this constant looking to the Lord will gradually be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Giving Out Gospel Literature and Gospel Tracts</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We want to stir up the spirit of the gospel throughout all the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through gospel tracts and gospel literature, we should spread the gospel all over Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gospel is preached not only with our mouths but also with our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can open our mouth to testify for the Lord and also testify through the activities of our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If three thousand saints are willing to distribute one gospel tract every day, three thousand tracts would be handed out every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If each saint handed out ten tracts, thirty thousand tracts would be distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way Taiwan would soon be filled with gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the gospel is very common today, we still know that many people have never heard about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their hearts are open, and they would believe if they heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we need to do all that we can to sow the seed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today both truth and lies go side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If truth does not spread, lies become prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In today s society people believe many things that are not true, because they are constantly repeated and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should speak and spread the precious truth that is in our hands even more.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Using Bible Verses and Hymns Skillfully</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hymns are the best weapon in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man s mind is harder than his heart, and changing his mind is more difficult than touching his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hymns are the best tool for touching a man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have many gospel hymns, and we should learn them one by one so that we can sing and declare them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, Hymns, #1024 speaks of our need for Jesus, and Hymns, #1080 speaks of the vanity of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should learn these hymns, and we can write them on paper and put them up in the house, or we can make note cards and place them on the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then when people come to our house, we can sing these hymns with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we have things that people did not have thirty years ago, such as tape recorders and other audio devices.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can make good use of them to play gospel hymns at home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can give tapes to those who drive to work, and we can play songs to those who ride with us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the office, if circumstances allow, we can play music for people during our break times.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should make good use of every opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>People may oppose us if we preach the gospel, but no one will oppose us if we sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Singing hymns will sow the seed of the gospel into people, little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not only use the Bible verses in a flexible way but also use the hymns in a flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The effective preaching of the gospel depends on our flexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to spread the gospel through big meetings and small groups, through contacting people and making phone calls, and through tracts and tape recorders.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After we have done all these things, some results will gradually be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot expect everyone to be an evangelist; nor can we expect everyone to be eloquent and gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet if every saint is faithful before the Lord and willing to gain at least one person each year, our numbers will certainly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The new way that the Lord has given us is a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that this burden and this way can be brought into the small groups to make every brother and sister a person who participates in the move of the gospel as well as a person who propagates the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way, the Lord will have a more rapid increase and a more rapid spread among us.</S>
