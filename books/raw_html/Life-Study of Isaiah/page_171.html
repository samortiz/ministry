<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A SON GIVEN BY THE ETERNAL FATHER</H2><P>The child born of a human virgin is a son given by the Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6a; John 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. His Name to Be Called Wonderful Counselor,<br>Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace</H2><P>Isaiah 9:6 says that this One's name is to be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace." Thus far, we have seen that this One is both Jesus and Immanuel. Isaiah 9:6 reveals four more items of what Christ is. Some translations separate the words Wonderful and Counselor with a comma, indicating that these are two separate titles. However, because the other items in 9:6 are composed of a noun with a modifier, it is logical to say that "Wonderful" should modify "Counselor." Christ is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace.</P><P>The prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 concerning Immanuel can be seen in its fulfillment in Matthew 1:20-23. The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 concerning Christ as the wonderful One can be seen in its fulfillment in John 3:16. Isaiah 9:6 says that "a child is born to us, a son is given to us." John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son." John 3:16 is based upon Isaiah 9:6. A son was given by a child being born. In the birth of that child, there was a gift given by God&#151;His Son. That child was both a man-child and a God-child, that is, a God-man child. The Eternal Father gave us a gift, and that gift was His Son, who became the God-man.</P><P>His Son, the gift given to us, is called the Wonderful Counselor. He is also the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. The Gospel of John unveils the Son as well as the Eternal Father. The Son and the Father are mentioned many times in this Gospel. It shows us that the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; 14:9-10). He is also the Prince of Peace. This title is related to government. Isaiah 9:6 says, "The government is upon His shoulders," and verse 7 says, "To the increase of His government and to His peace there is no end." In Luke 1 the angel Gabriel said to Mary that "He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall not be an end" (v. 33).</P><P>This One was a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father. John 1:14 says that He was the Word, the very God, who became flesh. John 1:14 does not use the words born or given. It says the Word became flesh. He was the Word, and then He became flesh. His becoming flesh was His coming full of grace and reality. His becoming flesh was God's incarnation, in which He became God's embodiment (Col. 2:9). God came as grace and reality for us to receive Him, gain Him, and enjoy Him. This God, who is grace as our portion, is also our reality. We had nothing real until we received the incarnated God. When we enjoy Him, He becomes our portion, and this portion is our reality. When the Word became flesh, He came as grace and reality.</P>
