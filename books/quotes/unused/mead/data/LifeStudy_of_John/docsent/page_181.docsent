   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. The First Meeting of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>before Pentecost</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The gathering of the disciples in 20:19 in the evening of the day of the Lord s resurrection may be considered as the first meeting of the church before Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This meeting was to fulfill Psalm 22:22 according to Hebrews 2:10-12 for the Son to declare the Father s name and to praise the Father in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To declare the Father s name is to make the Father known to the disciples as the source of life that they might partake of His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To praise the Father in the church is to praise the Father in the praising of His believers in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Psalm 22:22 and Hebrews 2:10-12, the resurrected Lord did both of these things in the first meeting of the church on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After His resurrection, the Lord came to meet with His disciples, starting from the evening of the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, in the Lord s resurrection, the matter of meeting with the saints is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mary the Magdalene met the Lord personally in the morning and obtained the blessing 20:16-18 , but she still needed to be in the meeting with the saints in the evening to meet the Lord in a corporate way to obtain more and greater blessings 20:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this first meeting of the Lord with His disciples after His resurrection, we have the Lord s presence, the peace, the Lord s sending, the breathing, and the authority to bind and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are the blessings which the Lord brought to His disciples in that church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However good Mary s fellowship was with the Lord during the morning watch, she still needed to come to the evening meeting to obtain all these blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These blessings are greater and more important.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may receive something from the Lord and even of the Lord during the morning watch, but this is something we need personally and individually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must also come to the meetings to receive something more important.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The morning watch and the church meetings are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need the personal blessing of the first aspect as well as the corporate blessing of the second.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thomas missed the first meeting the Lord held with His disciples after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, he was compensated for what he missed in that meeting by attending the second meeting 20:25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Oh, we must not miss any of the church meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not say that it does not matter and that we shall rest at home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord comes, we, like Thomas, may miss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thomas missed the Lord s appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Due to his absence from that church meeting, he really lacked something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This chapter is full of revelation, but Thomas missed it all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He missed the revelation, the discovery, and the experience of the Lord s resurrection because he missed the morning watch and the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He missed the revelation that the disciples are the brothers of the Lord and the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He missed the peace, the breathing of the Holy Spirit, the divine commission, and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was saved and he was a brother, but because he did not attend that meeting, he missed a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the mornings we should have the morning watch personally and individually, but in the evenings we must come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How we need to come together with the other brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Lord will come with something more, something different, and something greater.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not be proud of your wonderful experiences during morning watch, and do not say that morning watch by itself is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You also need to come to the church meetings and meet with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of us miss the morning watch and some miss the evening meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we must have a personal morning watch as well as attend the corporate evening meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The morning watch cannot replace the evening meeting, and the evening meeting cannot be a substitute for the morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need both.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With God, everything is of two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even in contacting the Lord, there are two aspects, the personal and the corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this matter, there are the morning watch in the morning and the meetings in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we must neglect neither the morning watch nor the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mary received something new, fresh, and firsthand in the morning, and nothing could replace it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, she still needed something more the peace, the sending, the breathing, and the commission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These things can only be received in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The commission from the Lord is to the church, not to the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, we must be in the church before we can be sent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The commission is a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, we must be sent by the Lord in and through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is strange that this chapter never indicates that the Lord departed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It never tells us that He left the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is so strange that the Lord, with a physical body which could be touched, came in through the closed door.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that, after His resurrection, the Lord was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the risen Lord is now the Spirit, He can be with the disciples at any time and at every place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since His resurrection, the Lord has no problems with time or space.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord can now be with us under any circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although we may shut the door, He is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to this chapter, we do not know from where He comes or when He comes and goes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have read this chapter many times and I cannot find any indication where the Lord went.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that after the resurrection, the Lord is the Spirit and is with us as the Spirit at any time, at any place, and under every circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord is always with us; the only difference is that sometimes we sense His presence and sometimes we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even when we do not sense His presence, He is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With us today, it is not a matter of His coming or going; it is a matter of His appearing or disappearing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When He comes, it means that He appears; when He goes, it means He disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, however, He is here all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whether we sense His presence or His absence, the Lord is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is now no coming or going with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now it is only the difference of His appearance or disappearance.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since He has accomplished everything, He has made Himself one with the disciples, and they are now one with Him.</S>
