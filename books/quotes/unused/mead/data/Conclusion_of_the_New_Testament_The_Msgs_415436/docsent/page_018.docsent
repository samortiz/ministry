   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Revelation 11:15 says, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The world spoken of in Revelation 11:15 is the earth that the meek will inherit in Matthew 5:5.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ alone is the proper Owner of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He paid the price on the cross to purchase the entire earth so that one day the kingdom would be established on it 13:44 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever our travels may take us, we need to learn to declare, This is my Lord s property.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Temporarily it is usurped by the enemy, but one day my Lord will come to claim what is His.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sooner or later, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 11:15 is a part of a promise that God made to Jacob in Genesis 35:11, which says, A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, / And kings shall come forth from your loins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we have a company of nations, indicating multiplication, and then we have kings, indicating the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following Jacob, there was the nation of his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then there was the kingdom of his descendants under David and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament there was the kingdom under his descendant, Jesus Christ; in the next age there will be the millennial kingdom; and after that, the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This one matter of the kings requires all the subsequent books of the Old Testament and the New Testament for its fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the church today as God s kingdom on earth is included in this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything in Jacob s life is a type to be fulfilled by us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not be satisfied to have one or two people saved through us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, we should say, Lord, I am not happy with this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I want to see the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I need the multiplication that will issue in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should have the faith for it, saying, Lord, I would have the faith to be multiplied, not for my empire but for Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He, Lord God the Almighty, Who Is and Who Was, Having Taken His Great Power and Having Reigned</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of Christ at His coming back Dan 7:13-14; 2:44-45 , the twenty-four elders will fall on their faces and worship God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned Rev 11:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here it is difficult to determine to whom the word You refers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because verse 15 speaks of Christ s reigning, but in verse 17 it is the Lord God the Almighty who is reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Does the word You in verse 17 refer to Christ or Lord God the Almighty?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, is it Christ or Lord God the Almighty who reigns?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although this is ambiguous, we may say that it is both Christ and Lord God the Almighty who reign.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In these verses we see the Divine Trinity God, who is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible often refers to the Divine Trinity in an ambiguous way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because certain terms in the Bible reveal the Divine Trinity in an ambiguous way, it is difficult to discern which one of the Trinity they refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is often better to attribute such terms to the entire Triune God.</S>
