   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE THE BLESSING RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE LOVING SEEKERS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH HIS LAW AS HIS LIVING WORD 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 119:130, 105; 19:8b; 119:25, 50; 1:1a, 2-3; 19:7a; 119:41, 110, 170, 28, 76, 103, 116-117</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law as the living word of God has many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To the loving seekers of God these functions are the blessing received through God s law as His living word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message and in the message following we shall consider the blessing we may receive from the living Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the loving seekers of God receive blessing from His Word, it is possible to come to the Word of God and not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I know of many who have read the Bible and even studied it without receiving anything from it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the situation among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they read the Scriptures, many Christians do not receive any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only thing they get is vain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Using the knowledge they gain from reading the Bible, they engage in controversies over matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of being truly helped by reading the Bible, they argue about the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, first they themselves are killed by their kind of Bible knowledge, and then they use this knowledge to kill others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To them, the Bible is not a book that gives life; it is a book that kills.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the centuries, many have been killed by taking the Bible as nothing more than a book of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps the most striking example of those killed through Bible knowledge is the so-called higher critics of the Scriptures in the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In their study of the Bible, these higher critics exercised their mind to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consequently, they did not receive any blessing from their study of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our condition is normal, we should be helped and very much blessed whenever we come to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not receive any blessing, there must be something wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 ; therefore, the words of the Bible are God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, as the embodiment of God Col 2:9 , the Lord Jesus is Himself called the Word John 1:1, 14; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, coming to the Word should be the equivalent of coming to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the Word is the embodiment of God, it contains the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Word of God contains all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the reason the Word of God is so rich, substantial, living, and enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All that God can be to us, the Word can be also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Provided we have no problems within us which cause a hindrance, we should receive blessing whenever we come to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PROBLEMS OF THE HEART No Exercise of Heart</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you fail to receive help when you come to the Word, there is probably a problem of some kind in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your heart is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It may be that you have no genuine exercise of heart in coming to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You read the Bible, but you have no heart for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In human life it is possible to do many things out of necessity without having a heart for those things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, a young person may be forced to attend school, but he may have no heart for education.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He goes to school only because he is compelled to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, although we may read the Word of God, perhaps out of a sense of duty, we may not have a heart for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Divided Heart</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another problem you may have in your heart is the problem of a divided heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is possible that your heart is divided into two or three parts, perhaps even more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This may especially be true of young people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A young person may love many different things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This causes the heart to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One thing occupies one part of the heart, and something else occupies another part.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose a young man has a heart for his studies, but also has a heart for a particular form of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will cause his heart to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a person s heart is divided into two parts, one part for something good and another part for something evil, the evil tendency will always prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This seems to be a natural law or principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In his heart a person may have two opposite intentions; he may intend both to lie and to tell the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The evil intention, that of telling a lie, will prevail over the good intention, that of telling the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever our heart is divided, reading the Word of God will not help us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we come to the Bible halfheartedly or with a divided heart, we shall not receive blessing from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we come to the Bible, we must come with a whole heart and with a single heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not profitable to read the Word of God in a halfhearted way.</S>
