   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTERS AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God raises up special ministers in every age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Church history during the past several centuries shows that the church was built up by special gifts of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I love all those brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I love Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I love Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I love Darby, etc. All of these spiritual giants were greatly used by God at the beginning, but gradually the only thing that was left was a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is really pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I cannot reject the truth released through these persons, but I cannot accept the churches they have formed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because they did not see the local church, they set up churches according to their ministries and controlled these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Scriptures, one never finds a minister of the gospel controlling a certain church or several churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, no minister is greater than the local church; rather, the local church is greater than the ministers cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 Cor 3:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this principle is not upheld, sects will be produced immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once an assembly comes under a certain minister or a certain commission, it becomes a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Baptism is a truth which we preach and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should immerse people into the water so that they can become disciples of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But making a commission the basis for setting up a church and putting the church under the commission of a truth is forming a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a department store there are apparel, shoe, watch, handkerchief, and souvenir departments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of the departments work together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do this, there will be no possibility of having a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise God, He has commissioned me with a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I confess that I am not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, since God has been gracious to me, I have become bold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Should I then preach myself?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, I should not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But should I be unfaithful?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, I cannot be unfaithful either.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I go to a certain place, I will establish an assembly there; I will save sinners and also have my ministry there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after I finish my work, I will leave and be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I should not expect the entire city of Shanghai to be handkerchief stores and force others to use handkerchiefs for everything eating with handkerchiefs and drinking with handkerchiefs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, I should not demand that all other shops be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What relationship should a worker hold with the assembly?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the assembly a worker is the same as other brothers who are holding other jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether the brothers who hold other jobs make money or lose money has nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, George M ller set up an orphanage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This work had nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, the condition of a worker has nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the students at Cheloo University to have their own table is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only the church in Tsinan is qualified to represent Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Cheloo University cannot be a unit upon which a table is set.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one stands on the ground of the church in Tsinan, he can break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's ordination, every church is directly related to that locality alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The purpose of this is to maintain the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is the church that every Christian attends a church in the locality, or is it a church that is smaller than the locality?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am a brother in Shanghai, but my work is in Jen-Ru.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people want to replace the church with the work, but the work can never replace the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I should not expect God's children to belong to me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If this is not the case, may the Lord forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am a brother in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If tomorrow I go to Nanking, I will immediately become a brother in Nanking and not a brother in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope you will not demand believers in Shanghai to leave this and that organization in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to talk positively about the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whoever has been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and has been regenerated by the Spirit is in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There should be no discrimination of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our heart needs to be enlarged to include all the believers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May all the workers be clear about the nature of our testimony and the practice of the local church.</S>
