   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This Turning Wheel in God's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having the Body of Christ as Its Axis</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that every wheel has an axis; it is the center of the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The great turning wheel of God's economy has the Body of Christ as the axis and the center.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a certain sense according to the truth, we can say that this axis is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as far as God's New Testament economy is concerned, this axis is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we say here that the turning wheel of God's economy has the Body of Christ as its axis.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that all of God's move and work today are joined to the church and are for the church, the Body of Christ Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we know something about world history and would spend some time to study the Old Testament prophecies, we have to bow down and worship the Lord that indeed, everything in the universe and all the world situations, whether political, military, industrial, commercial, scientific, or educational, have the Body of Christ as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are all joined to and are for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We moved to Taiwan from the mainland in the second half of 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The world situation was tense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We decided to forget about everything and seize the opportunity to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, we printed big quantities of gospel tracts in proportion to the population of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We divided up the city into districts according to the streets and passed out these tracts from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, we made huge gospel posters and posted them at train stations, crossroads, and other important places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We even posted them by the doors of the brothers' and sisters' homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, we sent out gospel teams to promote a gospel atmosphere along the large and small streets.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, every week, we went to the New Park to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We did this for four or five years, and our number increased from three or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>None of us was affected by the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time until now, after so many seasons of battering storms and rain, Taiwan is still solid as a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It has even made such miraculous achievements in recent years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe all these happenings are for the move of God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that the entire world situation is for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, the New Jerusalem, as the ultimate consummation of God's work, is the axis of God's move in the whole universe Rev 21:2, 11; 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The whole universe is full of God's move, and the ultimate achievement of this entire move is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church today is the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the future, and the Lord's recovery on earth represents His church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why I have a strong burden during this conference to fellowship with all of you again concerning the church as the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy.</S>
