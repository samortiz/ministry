<p>The first incident that John describes using this style of writing occurs in the second half of chapter 1. In verses 19 through 51 he presents a background involving the Jewish religion and the context of John the Baptist&rsquo;s testimony. The background and the context show that the expectations, focus, and speaking of those in religion do not correspond to God&rsquo;s intention in the universe.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s presentation of the background of religion involves Judaism, which is not an ordinary heathen religion. Judaism is a true religion, and it is based on God&rsquo;s revelation in the age of the Old Testament. Verse 19 says that the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to John the Baptist. Priests and Levites are the main figures in Judaism. The priests are in the central position, and the Levites are in a supporting position. These religious people came to ask John the Baptist, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; (vv. 19, 22). They had studied the Old Testament thoroughly and understood it well, and they knew of God&rsquo;s promise in the Old Testament of a coming Messiah. <em>Messiah</em> is a Hebrew word, and when it is translated into Greek, it is &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; (v. 41). In their reading of the Old Testament, these priests and Levites knew that Elijah was coming and that God would raise up a Prophet, just as He had raised up Moses (Mal. 4:5; Deut. 18:15, 18). When John the Baptist came, his clothes and food were quite different; nevertheless, he spoke with much power and authority (Matt. 3:1-12). Consequently, these religious people wanted to know if he was the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet (John 1:20-21).</p>
<p>When they came to ask John the Baptist, he told them clearly, &ldquo;I am not the Christ&rdquo; (v. 20). They then asked, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; They asked again, &ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo; John answered, &ldquo;No&rdquo; (v. 21). Then they became confused and asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; (v. 22). He said, &ldquo;I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, &lsquo;Make straight the way of the Lord!&rsquo; as Isaiah the prophet said&rdquo; (v. 23). John the Baptist acknowledged that he was only the voice that Isaiah had prophesied would come and cry out in the wilderness (Isa. 40:3). He said that he was only a voice crying in the wilderness, &ldquo;Make straight the way of the Lord.&rdquo; Then they asked, &ldquo;Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?&rdquo; (John 1:25). John answered them, &ldquo;I baptize in water; but among you stands One whom you do not know&rdquo; (v. 26). John&rsquo;s word was a recommendation of Christ, but they did not recognize Christ or even understand John&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>After describing this religious background in verses 19 through 28, the apostle John continued to describe the immediate context of John the Baptist&rsquo;s speaking. Verse 29 says, &ldquo;The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; John the Baptist did not refer to the Lord as Christ, the Prophet, or Elijah. Although the Lord Jesus was the Christ and also the Prophet, John the Baptist did not refer to Him in this way. He spoke of the Lord in a way that was contrary to the religious background presented in this chapter. John said that the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. John the Baptist even acknowledged that this was contrary to his understanding, saying, &ldquo;I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 33). When John baptized the Lord Jesus in water, he saw the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him as a dove (v. 32; Matt. 3:13-17). This is the reason that John did not refer to the Lord Jesus as the Christ or the Prophet. Rather, he referred to the Lord as &ldquo;He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 1:33). John the Baptist&rsquo;s special reference to introduce Christ was in contrast to the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>John the Baptist spoke of two things in contrast to the background of Judaism: &ldquo;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Christ is the Lamb, and the Spirit descended upon Him as a dove. Consequently, John did not speak of Him as the Christ or the Prophet but as the Lamb with the Spirit as a dove. According to the background of Judaism, people discussed the coming of the Messiah, the appearance of the Prophet, and the coming of Elijah (Mal. 4:5). However, when John the Baptist began to testify of the coming Lord, he did not speak of Him as the Christ, the Prophet, or Elijah. In contrast to these concepts, he spoke of the Lamb of God upon whom the Spirit descended and abided as a dove. The testimony of John the Baptist was completely contrary to the background of Judaism.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
