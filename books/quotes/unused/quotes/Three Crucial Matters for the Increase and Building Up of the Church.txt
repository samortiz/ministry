In the past we stressed the truth that the ministry is for the churches but that the churches are not for the ministry
If the churches are not in one accord with the ministry the ministry has no way to build up the churches or to fight for the Lords recovery
When we say that the ministry is for the churches, we mean that the ministry builds up the churches; the ministry does not build up itself
When we say that the churches are not for the ministry, we mean that the churches are not for the building up of the ministry
Whoever is of military age in a country should fulfill his military service and be in one accord with the army
In the same way the churches must be in one accord with the ministry, supporting the ministry and being for the ministry
Today the Lord's recovery has more than six hundred churches all over the earth, and they are all supplied by the ministry
They were not afraid of the threats from the Jewish leaders, and they prayed in one accord for the Lord's move
Previously they had differing opinions and argued , but in Acts 1, Peter and the sons of thunder, James and John, no longer contended
Christians say that they do not accept human control and justify this by saying that they are following the Holy Spirit
Everyone supposedly follows the leading of the Holy Spirit, but the result is that every person has a different leading
Since the time that the Lord's recovery was raised up, we have rejected control because it is not found in the Bible
We must not say Amen when things are peaceful but when the battle begins, say that we need to reconsider because it is not convenient
In Ephesians 4:3 Paul, speaking of the oneness in reality, exhorts the Ephesian believers to be 'diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit'
Being one in heart and in soul thinking the same thing and speaking the same thing are the foundation for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
Many Christians hope to obtain the outpouring the baptism of the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit is never poured out upon individual members
If we produce five hundred full-timers every year, we will have two thousand five hundred full-timers in five years
These two thousand five hundred fulltime serving ones will need more than two thousand five hundred moneymaking fulltimers to support them
The labor of the ministry has not been in vain because a number of spiritual things have entered into the saints
There are three important matters for the spread and increase of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching
Every country is founded upon its society, and the soundness of a society depends upon begetting, nourishing, and teaching
We need a plan to preach the gospel in every school, in every home of every neighborhood, to every level of society, and in every village
In society nourishing takes place in the homes; in the church nourishing should take place in the home meetings
When the work began in Taipei more than thirty years ago, as soon as a person was saved, he was placed in a home meeting
If the church in Taipei has four hundred home meetings functioning in this way, there will certainly be the increase
There is a locality near Taipei that holds two classes for Truth Lessons at four different times on the Lord's Day
All teachers know that teaching a matter, rather than simply studying it, is the best way to gain a thorough understanding
If people do not understand the truth today, they will understand after they hear the truth over a period of time
May all the churches in Taiwan practice begetting, nourishing, and teaching for the increase and building up of the church
We must not forget the three crucial matters for the increase and building up of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching
Even though we did not preach the gospel much in the past, some people were saved, but not many of them remained in the church
When we preach the gospel, we beget many children, but if we do not nourish and teach them, they will not be useful
If we desire those who are gained through our preaching of the gospel to remain in the church, we must nourish and teach them
Those who are able to speak many languages can travel all over the world to preach the gospel and expound the truth in every place
We should not look to our past success or simply give messages on being spiritual, loving the Lord, bearing the cross, and resurrection
We have been preaching these things for more than ten years, but the brothers and sisters are still not sufficiently nourished or educated
Our goals today are spreading the gospel, building up home meetings, and teaching the truth with Truth Lessons
The elders, co-workers, and full-timers need to learn how to speak these three goals in a clear and strong way
People praise us because our exposition of the Bible has influenced Christians in the Far East for the past forty years
Christianity in the Far East openly admits that we have influenced their knowledge and exposition of the Bible
In the past Western missionaries came from Europe and America to preach the gospel in the provinces of interior China
We have wasted the Lord's grace, especially during the past twenty years when very few full-timers were produced
There are approximately twenty thousand saints in Taiwan, but we have produced an insignificant number of full-timers
The world today has become smaller; hence, if the Lord is unable to spread in Taiwan, eventually the churches in America will be affected
If we continue to ignore the Lord's leading and teaching, sooner or later we will force Him to raise up another group of people
No matter how many items of clothing a person has, he has only one body, and no matter how much he eats, he has only one stomach
They sent one thousand copies of the New Testament Recovery Version in English, worth approximately fifty thousand to sixty thousand dollars
If everyone saved one dollar for the Lord every day in one month they would have thirty dollars and in one year three hundred sixty dollars
We have four directions in the gospel: the campuses, the neighborhoods, every level of society, and every town and village
We may not be able to go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel, but we cannot say that we do not have neighbors
We must understand that the big meetings are for the occasional worshippers who have not been completely gained by the Lord
After seven or eight people meet together three to five times in a home meeting, the saints will know each other
There are no famous people giving messages in the home meetings, and the co-workers or elders do not need to prepare a long message
The elders and co-workers must learn how to prepare simple, home-cooked, healthy meals for the home meetings, not big feasts
According to my observation, even though we spend the time after remembering the Lord to share our testimonies, there is not much enjoyment
Many people do not speak in the meetings because they are afraid that if they speak, they will expose their condition
We must ensure that every time the brothers and sisters come to the meeting, they enjoy fellowship with the Lord and are supplied with life
There will then be three meetings every week in which we read messages-home meetings, bread-breaking meetings, and prayer meetings
The function of the home meetings will be manifested, and people will be successfully brought to salvation, cared for, and supported
We have information cards for more than eleven thousand people, but only about four thousand people meet regularly
For the future of the church and for our spiritual growth and function before the Lord, we need to receive this burden
We must also remember Matthew 25:19, which says, 'After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them'
When the Lord returns, the good and faithful slaves will be rewarded, but the evil and slothful slaves will be punished
Before we go to see the Lord, we must seize the opportunity to love Him, serve Him, please Him, and be ready to settle accounts with Him
We should not think that it is so difficult to be a teacher of the truth and that only a few people can be teachers
After reading the outline, the teacher should give an overview of the lesson and the saints should read the lesson together
A father with several children would never say that the clever ones are his real children, but the foolish ones are false children
In Matthew 13:24-30 the Lord said that the enemy sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and that the tares and the wheat are growing together
The tares are false believers, and the Lord is waiting until the end of the age to weed out the tares, bind them into bundles, and burn them
The virgins are resurrected believers who are raptured to the Lord's judgment seat to render an account to the Lord
According to the Lord's word in Matthew 24 and 25, we will either receive a reward from the Lord or be cut asunder by Him in the future
In John 15 the Lord said that He is the true vine, we are the branches, and He will take away any branch that does not bear fruit
According to our experience and knowledge of the truth, the Lord cuts off from the vine tree any branch that does not bear fruit
Concerning the evil slave the master says that he 'will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites
The master then says concerning the evil and slothful slave, 'Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness
When the semester is over, the child who receives an A receives a reward, but the child who fails is restricted to his room
Whether he is in his room for half a day or for one hour, while he is in the room, he is cut off from his father's presence
If we want the Lord's recovery to spread and increase, we must be strengthened in the matters of begetting, nourishing, and teaching
Most Christians think that spreading the gospel, holding home meetings, and teaching the truth are not for the 'pew members'
In order for the two men to be working in the field and the two women to be grinding at the mill, they must be living
He delivers His possessions to those who were strong and capable and to those who were weak and not as capable
We did not appoint leaders in the home meetings, because as soon as there is a leader, the saints stop functioning
Whether they are male or female, young or old, their eyes should be fixed on the Lord, and they should not have any other goal
A fulltimer is a person who lives unto the Lord and is for the Lord his person life living and career are unto the Lord and for the Lord
The money we offer is used to buy Bibles and spiritual books or to support the fulltimers who preach the gospel therefore people are saved
Someone may never go to America, but because his money went there for the work, there will be Americans saying that they were helped by him
Apart from taking care of their living and their childrens education the believers with jobs should use their money absolutely for the Lord
Working full time for the Lord and making money full time for the Lord are two ways to effectively use the Lord's gift
The Lord has shown us that the three crucial matters needed in building up the church are begetting, nourishing, and teaching
When we fellowship with the Lord in the morning, He may touch our conscience, telling us to deal with our sins against others
If we watch television instead of enjoying the Lord, our prayer in the home meetings will be without oil, and we will not supply the saints
Because we are using the riches that the Lord gave us, we will feel that there is more oil flowing into us than there is flowing out of us
When each member fulfills his function the meetings are fresh living strong and bright and they can attract supply support and gain people
If we lead people to diligently read Truth Lessons, they will receive it, and they will spontaneously enter into the truth
During the classes on Truth Lessons, we must lead the saints to read each lesson, but we should not explain too much
If two home meetings save one person every week, the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei will have two hundred new ones
When we say that Taipei has four hundred home meetings, we mean that more than three thousand people are actively meeting in the homes
We must diligently read the Bible, pray, visit others, preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach Truth Lessons
We should never think that we can be loose because the Lord has not come for two thousand years, even though He said that He comes quickly
They spent their entire lives preparing to meet the Lord because they feared that they would not be ready when the Lord comes
We will participate in His wedding feast, partake of His joy, enter into the kingdom, and reign together with Him
Western suits have a shirt with buttons on the collars and the sleeves, they need a necktie, and the trousers need to be worn with a belt
We must sympathize with the older brothers and sisters because it is difficult for them to become accustomed to new things
Even though our progress is not ideal, we are moving forward, not backward, and our numbers have increased, not decreased
For this reason, when Paul went to a city, he would first go to the synagogue if there were no believers in that city
In this general meeting a particular and weighty message should be given for the benefit of all and to attract people
Every believer should also know the truth because God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth
Rather, they are like an educational course compiled in a systematic way to be taught to the saints step by step
In this council the leaders of the churches gathered together and recognized these books as being authoritative
Many people have been Christians for many years, but they still do not know that the New Testament has twenty-seven books
Christians, including those in the Catholic Church and in major Protestant denominations, believe in a creed as well as the Bible
Constantine himself was the moderator of this council in which the theologians and Bible teachers researched and debated the truth
As a result, under the authority of the Roman Empire all the theologians and Bible teachers came to an agreement in their beliefs
Genesis 1 speaks of God's creation and says that the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters
They say that the Spirit of Jehovah came upon a person and that the Spirit of Jehovah caused people to prophesy
All theologians agree that the divine revelation did not develop in a quick way; rather, it developed gradually
The development of the truth can be compared to the sun rising at dawn and shining brighter and brighter until it reaches its zenith
In relation to the divine revelation the Council of Nicaea did not define its creed at noontime but only at about ten oclock in the morning
The Creed instituted by this Council was not perfect or complete, because the divine revelation had not arrived at noon, at its zenith
Even if we forget these important points, by carefully studying these books, the riches will be deposited into us
The situation now is completely different because the government has worked hard, and there are many college students
The brothers and sisters have paid much attention to the table meeting, and more people attend this meeting than attend the other meetings
It does not matter whether we refer to these meetings as home meetings or small group meetings; there is no need to argue about the name
Because Saturdays may not be convenient for some brothers and sisters, they can hold this meeting on another day
We need the saints to pray individually, and we need all the saints to come together and pray at least once a week
In addition to these meetings there are other meetings such as coworkers meetings elders meetings training meetings and service meetings
The big meetings are for gathering people as the materials, and the meetings for Truth Lessons are for preparing the materials
The function of this meeting is to sustain the brothers and sisters, to recover those who have not been meeting, and to bring in new ones
In the past the church in Taipei had only eight to ten elders, and there was no way for them to care for so many people
Presently there are more than eighty elders, but there is still no way for them to adequately care for all the saints
All the brothers and sisters must function in the small group meetings and bear the responsibility to feed and care for one another
It is easy for eight to ten people, who meet together once a week in a small group meeting, to know one another
No person wants to live alone for a long time, regardless of his social status, education, or financial condition
Other elderly people do not exercise their bodies or their minds, and as a result they become less mobile and deteriorate mentally
Because human beings are social, it will not be easy for us to split a meeting after the saints meet together for a period of time
It gradually became a pattern in the early church life to hold the bread-breaking meeting on the first day of the week
As another example, in the early days of the Republic of China, children in the countryside wore their hair in long braids
We should not make any rules about this matter; instead, the saints in each locality must consider their situation and do what is best
Concerning splitting the small group meetings, some small groups have not reached the stage of maturity, so these groups should not be split
When we open our homes, our families will be blessed, and our relatives, friends, and neighbors will also receive a blessing
On the day of their salvation, they heard Peter's message, were baptized, and then opened their homes to meet together
Even before Cornelius knew the Lord Jesus or heard the gospel from Peter, that is, before he was saved, he had a meeting in his home
After Peter came and preached the gospel, all the members of the household of Cornelius were immediately saved
There was no church near the house of Cornelius, but that does not mean that they did not meet together after Peter left
If we also do not know how to sing the hymns, when we have a meeting in their homes, we will only be able to read the hymns, not sing them
They may also read the portion that says, 'Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me'
Even if the meetings in our homes do not seem so good, we will receive the blessing when we open our homes for the meetings
On the Sabbath day the Israelites did not remember God merely as their Creator; they also remembered Him as their Redeemer
When the unbelievers have entertainment and recreation, they tend to go astray and bring in numerous sinful things
Even if the people who come to our meetings do not receive salvation, at least we will no longer be indebted for their salvation
Even though they might not say anything, they will remember us when they encounter difficulties, or they may even come to us for fellowship
We simply need to open our homes and regularly invite people to come so that we can preach the Lord Jesus to them
The three measures of meal signify Christ as food to supply God's people, and the woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church
According to this principle, the Catholic Church brought in many heresies in an attempt to make the truth easy for people to receive
Someone in the ward asked the brothers whether they were pastors, because they prayed better than most pastors
Even though we changed the system, most of the brothers and sisters still do not pray or function in the meetings
We discovered that this was not a good practice, because most people did not know what to do during the time of silent prayer
Between 1969 and 1974 the testimonies after the messages were living, and sometimes thirty minutes was not enough time
In Taiwan, however, the testimonies are almost all dead, and the same brothers and sisters always stand up to speak
Today, are the new believers among us and those who have been saved for twenty years speaking Christians, or are we dumb Christians?
Starting from today, we must reverse our old habit of not speaking in the meetings by everyone speaking for the Lord in the meetings
According to a Chinese proverb-disease enters through the mouth, and misfortune issues from the mouth-we should speak as little as possible
The child was naturally talkative, and the mother was afraid he would say something inappropriate in the presence of others
There is another teaching that is used in Chinese homes: 'Many words, many mistakes; few words, few mistakes; no words, no mistakes'
If Matthew did not write his Gospel, Paul his Epistles, and John Revelation, there would not be a Bible, and we would be confused people
We should not rebuke the saints who have not been meeting for a long time, nor should we make demands on new believers
In the Old Testament God repeatedly exhorted and charged the Israelites to teach their children the words that He had commanded them
Some saints in Texas have the Life-study messages on their bookshelves and coffee tables, in the kitchen, and even in the bathroom
We spend much energy to set up home meetings, but we do not have the faith to ask the new believers to open their homes
We do not have any leaders among us; at the most we have patterns, who direct the saints and help them take the proper path
Some saints are afraid to knock on the door of the elders' room because they feel as if they are visiting the president
Changing the system is to eliminate the habit of some being the head so that every brother and sister can rise up to speak for the Lord
When they were in Rome, the church in Rome met in their home , and when they were in Ephesus, the church in Ephesus met in their home
We should have not only the Bible but also our publications, and we should discuss the things of the Lord all day long
In relation to man there is the principle that all our activities including eating drinking sleeping working and resting should be regulated
God desires that man use these five hours to worship Him pray to Him speak about Him with believers and unbelievers and sing hymns of praise
We can take some time in the morning to contact Him, and we can take some time in the evening to either attend a meeting or contact others
The children of Israel offered the Lord ten percent of what they received, and the rest of what they received was for their use
Taiwan has a population of almost twenty million, transportation and housing are convenient, and food is available
If a young person has the burden to serve full time, he should boldly become a full-timer without the fear of going hungry
We must do our best to preach the gospel, open our homes for meetings, and produce full-time serving ones who will work for the Lord
There is also an urgent need for us to practice three things: everyone speaking, no one being the head, and having a meeting in every home
Some people might say that everyone speaks and under normal circumstances everyone can speak however in the meetings very few people speak
The three poisons of no one speaking, everyone being the head, and homes without meetings are in us from degraded Christianity
Acts shows that the early believers opened their homes and met from house to house immediately after they were saved
In Taipei there are presently three to four thousand saints who meet regularly and participate in the activities of the church
What would the situation be if these four thousand saints spoke concerning God, the Lord Jesus, and the divine life every day?
May the Lord show us that we must overturn the habits of not speaking and not opening our homes, and we must hate being the head
Before we read the Bible with people or meet with them in our homes, we need to be prepared so that we can lead them to Christ
When a person hears these words, he will feel that the Bible is a superior book, regardless of his religious background
He was drawn to these words and read the rest of the psalm, thinking that the Bible was better than he expected
We can then preach the gospel by explaining that only the Lord Jesus can help her children; she has no way to help them
It is very convenient to preach the gospel in the communities because more than twenty households live in one apartment building
Some denominations are already working in these communities, and there are eighty to one hundred people in their meetings
The first step in gospelizing Taiwan is to gospelize the city of Taipei, and the best way to gospelize Taipei is to labor in the communities
If one thousand full-time brothers and sisters coordinate with the saints living in the communities, the result will be glorious
We must spread the preaching of the gospel because we live in this age and we have received a burden from the Lord to spread His recovery
The last chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, which is a book on the gospel of the kingdom, speaks of the Lord's ultimate commission
We need to go so that the Gentiles can become not only believers but also the Lord's disciples, that is, those who spread the Lord's kingdom
The land we purchased is on a hillside, and the government has many regulations concerning the development of hillside property
Some saints asked why we need a large meeting hall when we are promoting the burden for the small groups and home meetings
For this reason, we need a large meeting hall so that the saints from localities such as Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung can gather together
In the future we hope to have two thousand five hundred full-time brothers and sisters being trained each term
Presently we are unable to receive the saints from overseas into the training, because of the limitations in our capacity
It is a highly industrialized and commercial city, and the number of people living in the communities is steadily increasing
We need to pay attention to the development of our work and labor in one accord for the building of the big meeting hall
It is wrong for a person to think that because the work sends him out, it will also give him a specific amount of money
My household consisted of twelve people: my wife and I, our eight children, and two helpers whom we could not leave behind
We came as a household of twelve people and lived in a Japanese style house that was about three hundred square feet
Behind the meeting hall was a piece of land that had only the concrete foundations of houses that were bombed during the war
We then went to the Bureau of National Assets for the parcel number of the land and to find out if it had been sold to anyone
He said that he would cover all the expenses for the spread of the Lord's work in Taiwan, regardless of how much it was
From that time onward, for a period of eleven years, this brother bore the financial responsibility for the work in Taiwan
The Lord has blessed us not only in relation to our numbers and the work; He has also blessed us in material things
There are more than twice that number of volunteers who come in to work; there are more than one hundred twenty volunteers
We should not forget the amount of our pledge, and we should not take money from that amount to use for other purposes
The full-time brothers and sisters will be adequately supported and will have a stable living without anxieties
If the full-time saints are hindered financially, it will affect the brothers and sisters who want to go full time in the future
Rather, it is for them to live a normal life and take care of their children's education but not spend even one penny on unnecessary items
Brothers and sisters, it is a blessing and a glory for us to be willing to see the Lord's need and to give our all for His use
Today we are happy when we see people being saved, and when we enter the kingdom, there will be people welcoming us
Bless their homes, their children, and their jobs so that they can give themselves, their households, their time, and their money
Lord, for the sake of the increase and spread of the churches, bless this country, our society, and the development of this island
We ask You to gospelize, truthize, and churchize Taiwan so that Taiwan can become an island that is full of Your testimony
From 1922 to 1984 the Lord released more truths among us than among any other Christian group throughout history
There are many different Christian groups and broadcasters in America who use our publications as material for preaching
From Japan and South Korea in the north to Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the south, there are one hundred churches
There are eighty churches in Taiwan, and there are one hundred twenty churches on both the northern and southern islands of the Philippines
There is a total of six hundred churches in the Lord's recovery in more than thirty different countries on the earth
In Taiwan transportation and communication are developed education is widespread public security is good and the economy is well developed
Of course, the ones going to South America would need to speak Spanish, and the ones going to Africa would need to speak English
It presents the gospel of the kingdom, which is different from the gospel of the forgiveness of sins presented in Mark and Luke
According to the Lord's word in Matthew 24:14, the gospel of the kingdom must be preached wherever there are people
The end of the Gospel of Luke says, 'That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations'
He does not merely want us to go out and gain believers, but even more, He wants us to go out and gain disciples
Many of our publications are concerning the truth of the kingdom presented in Matthew and the truth of the divine life presented in John
In the past missionaries from different countries traveled great distances across the oceans to preach the gospel in China
The large meeting hall in Linkou will not only be a meeting place for the saints; it can also be a training center
Soon people from around the world will come to attend the training; therefore, we will need to prepare two thousand beds
We need to bear the burden to gospelize the island of Taiwan, after which we must go to every country and gospelize the entire earth
We receive phone calls from South America Australia New Zealand Europe and many other places saying Please send us someone we need help
There are many brothers and sisters in Taipei who love the Lord but whose circumstances do not allow them to serve full time
Initially we said that of the saints who regularly attend meetings, one in every twenty should serve full time
There are 42,000 brothers and sisters in the Lord's recovery on the island of Taiwan, and approximately 18,000 of them attend the meetings
If we calculate one-twentieth of those who attend the meetings, there should be nine hundred full-time serving ones
We need to consider who is willing to serve the Lord full time and whether the brothers and sisters are faithful in their material offerings
The building of the large meeting hall is not only for the churches in Taiwan; it is also for the churches around the world
In these next few years the brothers and sisters should do their best to offer money for the building of a large meeting hall
Since we agree with the present way that we are taking, we must give our offerings according to the ability the Lord has given us
Because of the presence of the churches in Taiwan, God is taking care of His testimony, and He is blessing this country
We are in the last days of this age but the gospel that has been preached over the earth is the general gospel not the gospel of the kingdom
The full-time brothers and sisters will go out in groups to every part of the island, and they will leave on the same day
The brothers and sisters who are trainees should be in one accord and care for one another while they are in the training
They must also learn to be frugal and show mutual concern by taking care of their necessities and giving the surplus to others
May the working saints do their best to give in order to cooperate with the church and to accomplish the Lord's move
Based on our observations over the past few years, we have a heavy burden and feel that we must change our way
Over the past six thousand years the methods used by human beings for transportation have continually improved
The elders were happy to receive the help, but they were unable to use the Life-studies to nourish the new believers
In the past the full-time trainees suffered when they went to nourish the new ones in their homes because they did not know what to say
If we have the Spirit without the Word, the meeting will be empty, and if we have the Word without the Spirit, the meeting will be dead
Volume 1 ends with a lesson on knowing the church, and volume 2 begins with the negative matter of knowing the sects
When a person is consecrated, he wants to serve the Lord, but because he is empty, he does not have the strength
When he preaches the gospel and serves the Lord, he sees the financial needs and participates in material offerings
In the meeting we obtain a diagnosis based on their need, and we give them an injection of the nutrients that they are lacking
In every meeting we should inject the new ones with nutrients when we speak with them, pray with them, and pray-read with them
If we take the way of reading the lessons slowly, we may need a year and a half or even two years to read all the lessons
All the churches in the Lord's recovery seemed to be in the same condition; they were neither increasing nor spreading
The co-workers and the elders are holding to truth and pursuing life; hence, there is no corruption in the churches
In spite of this the churches are not able to move forward and improve in order to increase in numbers and spread to new localities
In the past we were unable to bring one person to the Lord in one year, but now we can baptize two people in one evening
Initially we estimated that out of ten thousand people who are baptized, two thousand five hundred would remain in the church life
We also have confidence in the home meetings that are established with the new ones who are gained through door-knocking
The trainees made a list of their home meetings, which included the names of the new ones, their address, and their district
The home meetings do not have a noticeable result; hence, some elders are saying that they have not seen the newly baptized ones
Even some of the brothers and sisters are complaining because the newly baptized ones are not in the big meetings
These results show that it is possible to preach the gospel by door-knocking and to nourish the new ones in home meetings
The word preached among us is higher than what is preached in Christian denominations, and everyone likes to listen to the speaking
Twenty years of experience has shown that this kind of living has no impact in the gospel; it is unable to gain people
Even though there are many saints who still prefer the big meetings, simply enjoying a meeting is not enough to gain people or to keep them
Many who are presently seventy years old live alone and cook their own meals, because they are physically strong
When we take care of nutrition and hygiene, germs will not be able to grow, and we will live long and be healthy
In the past everyone in northern China liked to hire Cantonese nurses as servants, because the Cantonese nurses could do everything
We all need to be Cantonese nurses, those who are able to serve as elders, responsible brothers, and full-timers
In other words, we must be able to shepherd people, minister the word, baptize people, and teach Life Lessons and Truth Lessons
The key to turning the church life from the old way of meeting to the new way is to go door-knocking and have home meetings
Before we changed the system, we saw that the old way of Christianity with hired preachers is not a living way
We simply need to visit people every week and read a lesson with them to inject God's Word and the light of His truth into them
If we are familiar with the contents of each lesson, when we visit the new ones, we will know from speaking with them which lesson they need
What should we do when a person believes in the Lord and knows that he can no longer worship idols but still wants to keep them?
Whether we should baptize a person who has believed in the Lord but is unwilling to destroy his idols depends on the situation
We believe in the Lord, have His life, and are sanctified; therefore, we do not like to see believers smoking cigarettes
We should not do too much or too little; instead, we should maintain our contact with the new ones according to the truth
We must all be able to discern these conditions because there may be only two saints coordinating together for a home meeting
We should explain that the recovery has more than six hundred local churches in over thirty countries on all six continents
We should explain that we have big meetings in the meeting halls and that we have home meetings like the meeting in their home
We should not avoid responding to a question; otherwise, the new ones will misunderstand us or become suspicious
If they ask how we take care of our living expenses, we should say that we look to the Lord to meet the needs for our living
If a person says that he wants to give an offering, we should explain the principles of material offerings to him
We can explain that we do not write our name on the envelope when we make an offering and that it does not matter how much we give
The offerings are also used to purchase chairs, tables, and other items that are necessary for the regular operation of the halls
We may also explain that offerings designated to support those who serve full time should also be placed in the offering box
In other words, we should teach the new ones Life Lessons and also lead them into the practice of what they are reading
Once a week we break bread together in the meeting halls, and every three or four weeks we have a big meeting of the church for blending
At present there are at least six thousand people in Taipei who need to be cared for by the brothers and sisters
If there is not a meeting on Lord's Day morning, they will think that the church has left, and we will owe them an apology
The new ones who were visited four or five times say continually that they admire our perseverance in visiting them
When we knock on their door the first time they may not understand these things hence they might become angry and slam the door in our faces
After they believe in the Lord, they thank us for preaching the Lord Jesus to them and bringing salvation to them
In order for a training to be successful, the trainers and the trainees need to be blended together so that they can work together
On the one hand, they bear the responsibility of being an elder in the church, and on the other hand, they work to support their families
The elders desire to participate in the training and to go door-knocking, but their situations do not allow them to do so
The trainers should be able to take care of the needs of the training, and the elders should bear their responsibilities
When the elders lack the time to take care of the various needs, they should allow others to help them in the administration of the church
Nearly eighty years ago Sun Yat-sen led the revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and established the Republic of China
The fact that there are still problems in China today indicates that the revolution was not entirely successful
There were many foreign consulates, and there were post offices for countries such as France, Japan, and Germany
Some of the students wore Western suits, but when they wore their suits outside the school premises, people insulted them
The Lord's church has come to a standstill both in Christianity and in the Lord's recovery; there is no spread and no increase
Christianity has been in Taiwan for more than a century, but today only one person out of every forty is a Christian
The more that people study psychology and philosophy, the further they are from God, and the more they feel that the Bible is not reliable
Pastors and preachers graduate from the seminaries and teach the Bible, but people are often not satisfied with what they teach
Seminaries also pay a great deal of attention to the methods of preaching the gospel, to sermons, and to managing the church
Even though the seminary students have the Bible in their hands, they may not understand the things in the Bible
They know what the Bible says concerning Abraham and Moses, but they do not fully believe or receive what is recorded in the Bible
Some believers think that the identity of the author of the book of Hebrews is still undetermined, but we are clear that Paul wrote Hebrews
These points show that Christianity is poor because it does not teach people to enter into the truth and revelation of the Bible
We should not be set in our concepts and think that it is normal for only one person to speak while everyone else merely listens
Before we changed the system, most of us had not made any profit, but now everyone who goes door-knocking can make a profit
The Lord says Who then is the faithful and prudent slave whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time
We should lead the new ones to pray-read the verses quoted in Life Lessons so that the new ones may know the verses
Even Christians who have believed in the Lord for many years do not understand the precious names of the Lord Jesus Christ
The three names-Jesus, Christ, and Emmanuel-considered together mean that Jehovah came to be our Savior so that we may receive His salvation
On the one hand, He saves us, and on the other hand, He carries out God's commission and is with us, never leaving us
In His divinity Christ is God, the Son of God, and the Creator, and in His humanity He is man and the Firstborn of all creation
The universe did not come into existence through a process of gradual changes; rather, it was created by Christ
In His victorious resurrection Christ led us as His captives, released us from the captivity of Satan, and gave us as gifts to the church
In His earthly ministry Christ went to the cross, died for man, and offered Himself to God for the accomplishing of redemption
Hebrews 8:6 says, 'He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant'
On the cross Christ poured out His blood to cleanse us of our sins and to redeem us because as sinners we had lost God and His blessing
The first item we receive in the new covenant is the forgiveness of sins, and the second item is the divine life
After the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant in His death, He resurrected from the dead and then ascended to heaven
The Spirit causes us to taste the sweetness of having our sins forgiven by God and to sense the life of God within us
In other words, Christ is in our spirit, and He is also in heaven; He is in heaven, and He is also in our spirit
After losing our temper, however, we can always repent and ask the Lord to wash us with His blood and to forgive us
Even though our temper is a real problem, we can experience Christ as the heavenly Minister whenever we are about to lose our temper
Hebrews 4:14 says, 'Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God'
Hebrews 725 says He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him since He lives always to intercede for them
John 212 says If anyone sins we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the Righteous and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins
In other words, He gave us salvation, and He wants us to use this salvation to gain sons of peace through knocking on doors
We should consecrate not only the Lord's Day to the Lord; we should also consecrate three evenings a week to Him
If everyone participates, we will not need to go out every night; rather, every saint will be able to go out a few evenings a week
We knock on doors to make a profit by gaining people, and we have meetings in the homes of the new ones to give them food
We should not serve in the way of organization, nor should we hire a select group of people to serve on behalf of the others
Everyone can knock on doors to preach the gospel and everyone can have a home meeting to lead others to read the Lords Word and Life Lessons
Other believers are sinews, and they cause all the members to be connected together through joining and knitting
If any one part does not exercise its function, there will be a problem with that part, and this will cause the entire Body to suffer loss
When we make a certain facial expression many parts of our body including our ears our nose and even our hands need to act in coordination
If our hands are bound, the tone of our voice will be different, and our facial expression will not be natural
We should not think that our hands are unrelated to our speaking or that our eyes and nose are unrelated to our speaking
Even if we were in the church life for more than ten years, we did not lead anyone to salvation, nor did we take care of anyone
Some saints led people to salvation, because of the old way the new ones did not receive proper care and 'died prematurely'
Even though we murmured that one brother's messages were eloquent and another brother's messages were not, we were unable to speak the truth
Some brothers and sisters can pray with their companions, but they stop praying when another person joins them
If we do not love the Lord, we should give ourselves to love the world, but if we love the Lord, we must give ourselves for this
We should not say that we are a new believer, our gift is small, we do not understand the truth, or we do not have a function
The full-time trainees made weekly visits to more than six thousand new ones and brought these two thousand new ones to the meeting
One of the new ones testified that when the brothers and sisters knocked on his door, he was preparing to commit suicide
Soon after being baptized, some people bring their entire family and their colleagues from work to be baptized
If we are faithful to knock on doors, the day will come when our brothers and sisters in the Lord will be all over Taipei
We must be careful not to do anything that will issue in natural affection of the flesh and not the proper feelings of the Spirit
From our experience in the church life over the past sixty years, we know that no method is more effective than these two ways
Last Lord's Day the full-time trainees brought some of the new ones whom they are caring for to the meeting halls, and everyone rejoiced
Even though we highly commended the full-time trainees, we must speak a faithful word, because the meetings were not up to the standard
The newly baptized brothers and sisters will come to the meeting halls to meet with everyone one Lord's Day every month
In this way the brothers and sisters will see what the trainees are doing, and they will meet the new ones in the home meetings
The most important thing in the home meetings is to supply the new ones with the word and to teach them Life Lessons
Several groups can come together and find a large building within their district to use as a central meeting place for that district
If the saints in the Lord's recovery will promote door-knocking and the home meetings, we will eventually knock on every door on the earth
There is no other way to preach the gospel to the whole inhabited earth apart from knocking on people's doors and having home meetings
Even though it is somewhat more difficult for those who are pioneering the new way, the ones we bring to the Lord will follow us
We cannot continue the method of Christianity and hold big gospel campaigns, because that method does not beget many spiritual descendants
Even though our way appears to be very slow and difficult, a great deal can be accomplished by taking small steps
If one thousand five hundred saints bring one person to salvation every day, in one month we will gain forty-five thousand believers
They must give every Lord's Day and two or three evenings per week to the Lord to knock on doors and be in home meetings
The young people should not think that they will ruin their future by giving themselves to the Lord in this way
Lord, speak through every person during this time of fellowship so that we can touch Your heart's intention and Your way in our fellowship
During two terms of the full-time training more than twenty thousand people were brought into the church in Taipei
One-third of these people are in home meetings; about six thousand people are in at least two thousand home meetings
Presently, the responsibility for caring for these two thousand home meetings rests on the shoulders of six or seven hundred trainees
We gained these new ones and their homes by mobilizing one thousand trainees during two terms of the full-time training
Man also has a communal nature that enjoys being with other humans; therefore, after people are married, they want children
In the cathedrals there are choirs prayer ministers and a minister who gives the blessing hence the people do not need to expend any energy
When they go to worship services the ministers and preachers do everything for them and they only need to put money in the collection plate
In addition, we must take the church meetings to the homes of the new believers, and everyone in our home is expected to meet
After many years of observation and research, we discovered that in almost every denominational group everyone likes the big meetings
For many years we invited people to meetings and preached the gospel to them, but the little fruit that we gained did not remain
The home meetings meet the need of our communal nature, but we must pay a price to respond to our communal nature properly
In a normal family a person eats three home-cooked meals a day, and parents teach and discipline their children at home
Christianity has been on the earth for two thousand years, but the gospel still has not been preached to all the corners of the earth
If the brothers and sisters receive the burden to care for the home meetings, these twenty thousand new ones will be fed and cared for
In order to gospelize Taiwan, however, we must labor on the home meetings, because the home meetings are the key to the new way
In one of the churches in central Taiwan, the new believers who went from the home meetings to the meetings of the church have remained
All the new ones learned from the saints; the new ones are leading other people to believe in the Lord and are establishing home meetings
The writer said that after reading our books and watching our videos, the believers there were helped to have home meetings
They learned that we began the new way of door-knocking to preach the gospel, and they began to practice door-knocking
The responsible brothers from each meeting hall should meet together to fellowship concerning how to carry out these points
The brothers and sisters who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five should knock on doors and lead the home meetings
For this reason we should not do them according to our old ways but according to the instructions of the training
We need to fellowship with the Lord daily and have set times to touch the Lord, confess our sins, and pursue the growth in life
We also need to follow the Spirit, deny the self, not seek our own benefit, and bear the cross daily in order to follow the Lord
Many people seemed light rather than weighty before their salvation, even though they were well educated and had a high position in society
If we visit the new ones in their homes every week, what is deposited into them will be with them for the rest of their lives
Even if we answer their questions with a few simple sentences, our answer will remain in the deepest part of their being
They may ask a simple question about dealing with their parents; if we are weighty, even a simple response will give them a deep impression
If we want the Lord to spread His recovery and increase the church, we must be weighty people who walk on this pathway
If we are proper and weighty, their entire household will be blessed because they see a pattern that can benefit even their children
The new ones will become weighty people who fear God, believe in the Lord Jesus, speak the truth, and are proper
We pray that You would move among us and have the room to move through every one of us so that You can accomplish Your eternal will
We pray that You would bless Your church and remember every brother and sister, the home meetings, and every other meeting
Of these six thousand people, nearly four thousand meet with us one or more times a week, and their condition may be considered stable
In addition, the full-time trainees have been caring for some of the new ones for eight or nine months and for others only one or two months
Approximately five hundred fifty full-time trainees who have attended two terms of the training are willing to remain
When we had the largest number of trainees, there were more than one thousand people attending the training and eating meals
Our numbers are constantly increasing, and even though we emphasize home meetings, we still need corporate meetings at least once a month
A few years ago we obtained some property at Linkou and began preparations to build a large meeting hall there
We will not obtain a building permit in the near future and that we must temporarily leave that piece of property for later development
We now know that it is difficult to purchase inexpensive land in the outlying areas to build a large meeting hall
One hundred of these new ones come to the meetings regularly, and another thirty meet regularly in a sister's home
If they are not able to attend during the day, they will still receive much benefit from attending the training at night
We have been practicing the new way for more than two years, and most of the churches around the world are practicing the new way
The elderly brothers and sisters who have been in the church life for many years are experienced, and they have a heart to knock on doors
Even though the young people may speak quickly or may not be so polite, the elderly saints must not become angry
In 1984 we began to change the system to the new way because we saw a clear picture in the Bible concerning the proper church life
Even though we may become anxious, we should take heed to the prophetic word, because it is like a lamp shining in a dark place
We must see that the Lord wants to move quickly in these days and that we need to endeavor to cooperate with Him
According to our observations, during the past two thousand years of church history the gospel work was able to gain only small areas
There are about two hundred localities in the country of Brazil, and the countries in Central America are open to us
They also considered the Chinese to be unskilled workers because the Chinese who immigrated to America were mostly illiterate country people
Some people consider Greek to be a difficult language, but anything that is honorable and worthwhile is not easy
About two weeks ago we invited all the young people in the churches in Taiwan to attend a summer young people's conference
Matthew 24:14 says that the gospel of the kingdom must be preached in the whole inhabited earth before the end comes
Even though three thousand and then five thousand people were baptized in the early church , the believers did not spread
God allowed an environment that forced the believers to scatter from Jerusalem to other regions for the preaching of the gospel
Acts 8:4 says, 'Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel'
Of going from house to house to speak a word of light, revelation, and vision, the apostle spoke in this gathering
Many saints still prefer the methods and traditions of Christianity; these saints are holding on to the big meetings
We also have saints who feel that after working six days a week, they should come to the Lord's Day meeting to listen to a message and relax
As a result, the home meetings and the small groups lost the people who usually speak, and they lost their momentum
A brother who works in a hospital testified recently that one hundred fifty saints work as doctors, nurses, and staff in the same hospital
They simply come together to exercise their spirit and overthrow the system of everyone listening to one speaker
The people in the communities whom we brought to salvation through door-knocking do not know the practices of traditional Christianity
If we bring them to the meetings in the meeting hall they will see that only one person speaks and everyone else listens and nods their head
The gospel was preached to such an extent that there was no place left to preach the gospel, because everyone was saved
Even though the gospel fever had reached a peak, only a few decades later almost no one in the second generation remained
If the home meetings and the small group meetings are healthy, the churches will not die; on the contrary, they will be living
Even though the missionaries have left these countries, there is still a small number of local believers who suffer persecution
Changing the system was a revolution, but we were not overthrowing other people's lives; we were overthrowing our own lives
According to the old way, even after listening to messages for twenty to thirty years, the saints can only sit and listen to more messages
They should also contact other families once a week or at least every other week and meet with the families they contact
In these meetings they should not merely sing hymns and praise the Lord; they should also study the truth together
It is difficult for a student to retain anything if he only listens to famous lecturers at school but is not required to do any homework
In conclusion, as long as we all go out once a week to knock on doors, every saint should be able to baptize eight people a year
It may be that only two of the eight will remain and the remaining six will not remain, that is, that only one-fourth will remain
In the small group meetings we should speak to one another about what we gained in our fellowship with the Lord and in our experience of Him
We need home meetings small group meetings district meetings meetings in the halls and meetings in which the entire church gathers together
If we have a large meeting facility, we can do many things and have different kinds of meetings there every week
He listens in elementary school, high school, college, and even in graduate school, but he does not do any work on his own
He may have listened to lectures on chemistry, mathematics, and other subjects, but he has gained nothing and consequently has no usefulness
Not many can give a clear word on the parts of man the function of each part or even the difference between justification and sanctification
Our continual listening to 'famous' speakers has caused us to become loose in our life practices and to lose our pursuit in the truth
We have raised up numerous churches during the past fifty years, and we have learned much from our observation and experience
By 1984, however, we saw that the churches in the Lord's recovery, whether in Taiwan or in America, had become lukewarm
It is difficult to find a society as stable, prosperous, abundant in knowledge, and excellent in manpower as Taiwan
Many people have received higher education and are able to develop products that can compete in the world market
When we built the workers' home in 1954, we imported flush toilets from abroad because plumbing equipment in Taiwan was outdated
It is reasonable for us to maintain our strong points, but to maintain our old practices is a dreadful and serious mistake
The brothers and sisters have developed the habit of sitting in the meetings and listening to gifted brothers give messages
When a child grows to a certain stage, he will begin to speak, and when he reaches another stage, he can learn to read
Since we have been regenerated and have God's life in us, we should grow in life in order for our function to be manifested
Many saints in the churches have listened to messages for decades and have become dumb because they do not speak
If we want to grow in life and use our gift to supply others, we need to be educated by diligently learning the truth
Over the past twenty years, however, her ability to read Chinese has improved, especially her ability to read the Bible
When we rise in the morning, it is best not to immediately occupy ourselves with washing up or getting dressed
In addition to reading the Bible in the morning, we can read the Bible as we ride the bus to work or to school
If we would learn the truth in this way, we will be able to clearly explain what is justification and what is sanctification
If all the brothers and sisters can learn the truth in this way, they will speak out of the abundance within them
Many brothers and sisters have been Christians for more than thirty years, but they have never spoken in a meeting
If the young people in a country do not receive a basic education, the country will never become rich and strong
As a short-term benefit, if we read two verses a day, what we read will become very useful by the time we begin a home meeting in six months
The whole world is open to the Lord's recovery, because the Lord's recovery has the proper ground and is full of the truth
Five hundred young saints who can speak Spanish and who can go to Central and South America would not be enough to meet the needs there
There is a need everywhere-in the United States, Canada, East Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and North Africa
The blessing we receive from having corporate morning watch can never replace the personal contact we have with the Lord
The Lord said to Jerusalem I desired to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you would not!
Many people can testify that reading any kind of book, newspaper, or magazine cannot compare with reading the Bible
If we know the truth, we can teach our children and grandchildren, and when they live with us, our conduct and behavior will be proper
There will be no need for us to pray as we did in the past: 'Lord, today Brother So-and-so will speak the message
Such prayers are for listening to famous speakers; they are not prayers for the brothers and sisters to speak in the meetings
We should change our old concepts and not long for messages given by famous, eloquent speakers who use good stories and examples
If we do not know the truth, when people come to us with a problem concerning their marriage, we can only say, 'Our God is almighty
We should make a schedule for the seven days of the week, that begins with rising in the morning and ends with going to bed in the evening
Even though we have confessed our sins in the morning, if we become weak before noon, we should confess our sins again at noontime
We should believe with our whole heart that the Lord lives in us and that what we speak through faith has authority, power, and boldness
We are absolutely sure that as long as we practice step by step according to our schedule, we will walk in peace
If we practice these matters with persistence, considering them as part of our daily life, we will see the Lord's work
The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 can be divided into two groups: the first group consists of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, and Thyatira
The course of the second group began at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther, which brought in a revival to the church
The characteristic of the church in Philadelphia is that it has a little power and has kept the Lord's word and has not denied His name
Whereas Sardis is half dead and half living, Laodicea is neither cold nor hot, but the Lord desires that she be zealous
The Lord's word is very meaningful; on one hand, He wants us to be boiling, and on the other hand, He wants us to be burning
The fact that she has a name that she is living proves that she has activity and work, but there is no momentum of life in her activity
When the brothers meet the Lord in the morning and touch the throne of grace, they are in the condition of Philadelphia
The church can be degraded and become Laodicea because the believers may not have much fellowship with the Lord, even though they love Him
It now seems as if the gospel was never preached there; some people in Wales do not believe in or even know the name of the Lord Jesus
Later when he attends the Sunday service, he acknowledges his inability to understand the Bible or to be filled with the Holy Spirit
There are many in Christianity who cannot speak after they have been saved for five years and some cannot speak even after thirty years
They say, 'It is not my business to speak in the meetings; it is the responsibility of Brother So-and-so and the elders
The less a person speaks, the less he will know how to speak; eventually, he will give up speaking and only come for a Sunday service
We are happy to simply go to a chapel on the Lord's Day to offer monetary gifts and listen to the pastor's sermon
Some people use all kinds of reasons to attack us, saying, 'Do not go to them; they will not give you any rest
Even though they preach the gospel and people are truly brought to salvation, new believers are led to simply listen to sermons on Sunday
The more they listen to sermons, the more they dare not speak and the more they think that they should not speak
The Bible reveals that a proper Christian should love the Lord, take Him as the center, and give Him the preeminence, the first place
If, according to our situation, it is right for us to rise at 6:30 in the morning, we should practice this daily
If we begin our day in this way, we will live Christ throughout the whole day, and we will be filled with thanksgiving to the Lord
If a person lives Christ in his dealings with others and at home, work, and school, he will definitely preach the gospel
We should preach the gospel not only when we knock on doors at an appointed time; we should preach the gospel everywhere
He said, 'You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth'
Apparently, our job is our main occupation; however, before the Lord our main occupation is to preach the gospel
Our job is a secondary occupation that enables us to cover our living expenses; our main occupation is to live for the Lord
Because of their love for the Lord and His word, preaching the gospel becomes their main occupation, and their studies are secondary
Our primary occupation is to earnestly preach the gospel to all our fellow employees and then to their families
If we would speak to our families, colleagues, and employees, they in turn would speak to the people around them
It is normal for a teacher to preach the gospel to his students, to his colleagues and other staff members, and to their families
Fifty years ago in Tsinan, Shantung Province, there was an important official who had studied in the United States
A believer, who considered gospel preaching to be his main occupation, worked as a janitor in the same department as this official
Even though the brother would see the discarded gospel tract when he emptied the trash, he was not discouraged
The brother, who worked as a janitor, not only placed gospel tracts on the official's desk; he also prayed desperately for the official
One day the official decided to visit the brother at home in order to know the reason he was receiving the gospel tracts
The brother and his wife were both saved and loved the Lord; hence, there was a pleasant situation in their family
He meets with his family at home, visits new believers in their homes, and meets together with several homes in a larger meeting
Corinthians 14:26 says that when the church comes together, 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation'
The Bible does not indicate that in a regular gathering of the church only one person should speak while others listen
A new believer who practices speaking after his salvation will not be afraid to speak even to a large number of people
If all the brothers and sisters practice this, we will surely be the church in Philadelphia, not Sardis or Laodicea
We will be able to speak the Lord's words to one another in the meetings, and the words we speak will be words of truth
The most important goal in our Christian life is to preach the Lord Jesus and bring people into the Lord so that they can follow Him
If we are able to cover our livelihood by working eight hours a day, we should not work more hours even if we are offered a higher salary
Peter 4:10; 5:10; 2 Peter 1:2; and 3:18 can be grouped together into one category because they all speak of grace
Peter 4:10 says, 'Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God'
In the original Greek, the meaning of the word varied implies more than a large amount; it also implies a large variety
If the one hundred cakes consist of British biscuits, Danish pastries, and German bread, then there are many varieties
The word bountifully is an adverb or an auxiliary in the Chinese, but in Greek this word is a verb meaning to multiply and to increase
Eventually, the apostle Peter admonishes us to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
We have been conducting semi-annual trainings related to the life-study of the Bible for over ten years in Anaheim
The leading ones were concerned about whether fifteen hundred saints would be able to gain people by knocking on doors
Originally, we estimated that two hundred people could be baptized in ten days, but three thousand seven hundred people were baptized
If we speak only crucial words, we can touch people's hearts after just two or three words and lead them to pray and be baptized
Even though we may have listened to messages for more than thirty years, we do not have much to say, and we cannot speak the truth
When people come to fellowship with us concerning their problems, the most we can say is, 'The Lord is faithful'
Sometimes the brothers have encouraged us to speak in the meetings, but we could not say anything even though we desired to speak
There was a time in China when it was possible for a person to become a 'scholar' but still be unable to write a letter to his family
Some may say that as long as we love the Lord and love and pray for the church, the Lord will be pleased with us
Some saints have not led a single person to salvation in twenty years, because they have not had a normal Christian life
In a year of fifty-two weeks minus four weeks for holidays, one person could be saved during each of the remaining forty-eight weeks
All the teachers wore Western suits, but the students dared not wear suits or speak English, even though we were taught English
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit'
The branches that do not bear fruit will be taken away and will lose the enjoyment of the sap of the vine tree
The church is taking the new way, but this does not mean that it neglects the spiritual care of the brothers and sisters
We need to learn how to feed others with the Bible and how to use the truth to help others so that they may enjoy God's grace
We should not only receive the arrangement of the church through our enjoyment of grace; we must be those who have a vision
After we saw the light in the Bible, we were willing to receive the Lord's grace to recover the way that was lost
Ephesians 4:8-16 speaks mainly of the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the goal of the God-ordained way
It seems as though our initial speaking about the new way gave the saints the impression that the goal of the new way is to knock on doors
We preach the gospel by knocking on doors because we want to obtain the materials necessary for the building up of the Body of Christ
We preach the gospel for people to be regenerated and become materials for the building up of the Body of Christ
The further step of group meetings provides the saints with mutual fellowship, mutual care, and mutual edification
On the surface, our body seems to be made up of different members and parts that are joined together in an organized way
When we make a chair by joining different pieces of wood together in an organized way, we get something very different from a body
The traditional way of Christianity does not emphasize the Body of Christ; it emphasizes only outward organization
We need to turn to the new way in order to develop the organic function of all the members so that the Lord can obtain an organic Body
Even though we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world , when man fell, he became a captive of Satan through sin and death
The gifts-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers-are produced by the Head for the Body
Even though these four groups of people work in different ways, they all have one goal-the building up of the Body of Christ
The gifts do not build up the Body of Christ directly; instead, they perfect the saints to build up the Body of Christ
It is as if we conducted classes to spiritually educate the saints for decades, but no one graduated, and we did not produce many teachers
There will be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers among the saints, and the church will receive a great blessing
In addition, some saints will learn how to preach the gospel in new places, establish churches, and rightly expound the truth
May we all have a clear seeing of the goal of the new way and may we labor with one heart to diligently learn to walk on the Godordained way
The God-ordained way, which God has revealed to us in the Bible, builds up the Body of Christ through the organic function of each one part
If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the main way to preach the gospel is to go to the sinners
Where can we find fishermen who instead of going to the rivers and oceans to catch fish send out invitations asking the fish to come to them
Those of us who visit people to preach the gospel have experienced meeting people who really were 'wolves,' and they gave us trouble
Since the second half of 1986, more than ten thousand people have been baptized because the saints visited them to preach the gospel
Some Roman Catholic congregations have been influenced by us, and now they are visiting people to preach the gospel
In the past, even though we invited twenty to thirty guests to hear the gospel, only two or three would actually come
Now when we spend two or three hours to knock on twenty to thirty doors, we are able to lead at least one person to salvation
When we speak the Lord's word to others, we must believe that the Holy Spirit is with us, and we must exercise our spirit
During the past year and a half several hundred people spent all their time to experiment with preaching the gospel by knocking on doors
No matter how insulting people are to us, we should remain composed, and even if they curse us, we should not waiver
We must bring salvation to people in their homes, just as the Lord Jesus brought salvation to the house of Zaccheus
We were not clear that God does not want to force people to attend meetings; instead, He wants us to bring the meetings to people's homes
For this reason we should not leave immediately after we baptize a person rather we should spend at least half an hour to an hour with him
After this first meeting we should visit him again after two or three days and continue visiting him every few days for a month
After the first month we can visit the new ones once a week or at least once every two weeks to have a home meeting
At this point we can bring together three to five families of new believers who live in the same neighborhood to establish a group meeting
We must gradually lead the new believers from the group meetings into the district meetings and help them enter into the church life
The content of the district meetings is rich because we break bread for the remembrance of the Lord, and we study the truth
The mutual fellowship and enjoyment allows every person the opportunity to function, to speak for the Lord, and to build up others
The believers give material offerings, but they do not participate directly in the work of building up the Body of Christ
The brothers and sisters who function according to the operation of the divine life within them are living and organic
When he begins to function in the district meetings, we can entrust him to the church to be built up in the Body of Christ
These saints should form teams of three people that include an older person, a middle-aged person, and a young person
The saints still need to lead the new ones from the home meetings to the group meetings and finally to the district meetings
We are waiting on You and asking You to release Your heart's desire to us so that we may know Your will and touch Your way
You denied Yourself and did not live by Your natural life; rather, You lived absolutely in the resurrection life
When we go out, we want to be testimonies of Your resurrection so that the churches we establish will be golden lampstands
We need to consider how many days the saints should spend in the towns or villages for the spread of the gospel
Some saints remained in the first town, and the rest of the team went to a second town and spent twenty days there
According to our research, it is not good for us to have too few new ones, and it is difficult to care for too many new ones
Initially, we said that our intention was to establish a church in the two hundred twenty-seven towns and villages that do not have churches
Most of the ones going out for the spread of the gospel are young sisters, and we need to consider their safety in these areas
Consequently, we will probably reduce the number of target localities and not go to all two hundred twenty-seven towns and villages
We will select the more important places and establish churches in them; we can then spread out from these localities in one or two years
Reducing the number of target localities will also enable us to increase the number of days we spend in every town to twenty-five days
God wants man to work for six days and to rest on the seventh, just as He worked for six days and rested on the seventh day
According to the New Testament the Jews had something called 'a Sabbath day's journey' ; they did not walk a long distance on the Sabbath
You need to be restricted on your day of rest and not engage in many activities, such as playing ball and running
If you engage in too many activities you will be exhausted the next day and instead of having a day of rest you will have had a day of labor
It is best not to travel farther than the distance allowed on the Sabbath, but this is not a legalistic matter
The meeting halls should not be close to major streets, because the noise from passing traffic will make it difficult to have meetings
In our labor in the new localities, we need to gain households, because it is difficult for a church with only single saints to be stable
According to the Bible the practical church life is built up in the homes; hence, we must keep this principle in our work
Even though a local church with a total of twelve people in six stable households may be small, it will be stable
In every town and village that we go to, we must gain households and maintain a sweet relationship with every family
We spent three terms in the full-time training, one and a half years, to research and experiment how to knock on doors
These people heard the gospel, confessed their sins, called on the Lord's name, prayed, and received salvation
A team of twenty people should spend fifteen days to knock on doors and preach the gospel and ten days to set up home meetings
We should not be excited when we baptize many people, because there is still the problem of how to nourish these ones
Up to this point we have only considered baptizing people quickly; we have not considered what will happen to them after they are baptized
We must labor to preach the gospel and baptize people during the first fifteen days, but we should not baptize too many people
If we baptize only twenty people after laboring for two weeks, we will need to spend more days to gain another twenty people
As the full-timers go out in their teams, we will continue to learn, and we will also adjust our method based on their experience
It is best to wait a day before we express an opinion so that we can be sure that we feel peaceful about expressing it
If we do not have the peace, we should not express our opinion; rather, we should wait until we have the peace
We may feel that something is right and good, but if we are too quick to express our opinion, we may get a wrong result
According to a proverb, we should hold back half a sentence and not speak it even though what we want to say is at the tip of our tongue
Proverbs 10:19 says, 'When there are many words transgression does not cease, / But he who restrains his lips is prudent'
The best way to overcome our opinions is to refrain from speaking, no matter how strong and stubborn others may be
Sometimes they are not polite in their dealings with those around them, because they want everything to be perfect
The Bible says that the brothers should take the lead, and the Bible also says that the sisters are weaker vessels
The brothers must always be considerate of the sisters as weaker vessels, because they have weaknesses that the brothers do not have
It is good for the brothers to consider how the sisters were created when they touch any matter related to the sisters
We can hit a board of wood many times without breaking it; however, a pane of glass will break the first time we hit it
In conclusion, it is proper for the brothers to take the lead, but it is wrong for them to assume the headship
It is best to spend some time to nourish a person immediately after he is baptized and then go back to visit him the next day
We need to visit the new believers many times during the first month, because it is easy for them to become sick or to die prematurely
For this reason, those whom we baptize must be visited at least ten times in the first month after their baptism
During the past decades we baptized many people but most of them died prematurely and few have remained because we did not learn this lesson
After we baptize someone, we must nourish him immediately and then continue to nourish him during the next thirty days
We should not think that it is a matter of convenience for a brother to give a sister a ride in a car in order for her to do her shopping
Just as the meal offering could not be mingled with honey , the brothers and sisters must have a living testimony
Nothing damages God's creation and the man God created more than improper relationships between males and females
These young sisters were met by an elderly Western sister in Shanghai whose commission was to help them preach the gospel in China
After the fall man's first sense was to be ashamed of his nakedness; therefore, Adam and Eve made loincloths to cover their shame
If the people listening to our gospel are materialistic and despise spiritual things, we should not press them
The worldly people know that material things are worthless, and some religions even teach separation from the world
Even if we have a clear leading and the spiritual authority to speak a serious word, we still must be careful how we express things
We should simply speak the truth to them and give the word of the truth the opportunity to shine in them and enlighten them
We should not be in a situation where we do not have enough time, especially since we are going to the towns and villages to speak to people
In order for people to be edified when we speak, we should speak normally, without adding deep points or speaking shallowly
When a person says that he is already a Christian, we should learn how to use one or two sentences to find out if he is really saved
If we feel that he is not genuinely saved, we should treat him like a gospel friend and help him receive salvation
When we knock on doors, we should take the meeting hall as our center and begin in the areas around the meeting hall
In addition, we should have a formal ledger in which we record the date and amount of the general offerings and the designated offerings
In relation to designated offerings, we must clearly record to whom the offering is designated and when it is delivered to him
The letter of explanation should ask the recipient to sign the receipt and mail it back to us when he receives the funds
Without such procedures the church will suffer loss if we cannot give the saints a satisfactory answer regarding designated offerings
In every locality there are many saints who understand accounting; thus, these procedures should not be difficult
We should never allow only one person to open the offering box, and there must be a proper place to keep the key to the offering box
They should discuss matters to decide how to use the offerings and then convey any decisions to the accountant
The amount of money to be kept as petty cash should be decided by the saints responsible for financial matters
The owners of small shops may not automatically give us a receipt because this will make them liable to pay sales tax
We should be willing to spend a little more money for the sake of obtaining a receipt; as Christians, we need to be faithful
A few years ago there was a dispute in a certain locality concerning the funds used in building a meeting hall
If we had not paid enough in taxes, we should pay what we owed, and we should gladly pay any fines for delinquent taxes
It is best not to stay with a family if the husband and wife argue, because our presence will create more problems
If the wife is absent for a period of time or if she has passed away, even if there are children remaining, a sister should not live there
We should not take over the dishwashing; we should be alert and quick to help our hosts when they do the dishes
We should also bring our own apron and not expect our host to take off her apron when we want to help with the dishes
Everything is convenient in our own home, where we cannot get into trouble, but it is not so easy when we are in another person's home
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day'
We Christians are like the sun, and we should not have a morale that can be lifted up by excitement or emotions
Answer: The Lord Jesus also endured pressure from His relatives, because He did not take the time to eat when He was preaching
We must let new believers know that they should not be concerned about how others treat them and that they must endure persecution
The Israelites were shepherds, but because this was an abomination to the Egyptians, the two peoples could not be together
The New Testament says that parents will deliver up their children to death, and children will rise up against their parents
Answer: The relationship between a husband and wife is mysterious; therefore, we must not make loose decisions regarding their relationship
If we have the Lord's leading and a word of wisdom, we can say something deeper; however, we should be careful in what we say
All other relationships are easy to deal with, but the relationship between a husband and wife is the most difficult to resolve
We should never think that getting deeply involved in the family matters of the saints is the way to care for them
God wants to gain a group of people among His chosen ones to be the living members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body
We should first consider how many people we can take care of and then preach the gospel to save people according to that number
After one month of caring for the seven or eight new believers, some of them may begin to avoid us even to the extent of denying the Lord
It is difficult to understand the function of nourishing, and there are many important details related to nourishing
In His resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit to enter into those who believe into Him and who receive Him
God is Spirit, and we have a spirit; hence, we touch the Spirit and contact the Lord by calling on the name of the Lord
It is better to nourish a new one immediately after he is baptized than to wait and nourish him one week after his baptism
Sometimes we begin the meeting with prayer, at other times we may read a few verses, and at still other times we may sing a hymn
After meeting with the new ones in this way, we should bring them to the Lord's Day meeting and to the small group meeting
If several households in a neighborhood are saved, we can introduce them to one another and help them to visit one another
When everyone comes together, we must fellowship by asking others questions and answering questions concerning ourselves
When we knock on the door of the second home, we can begin singing a hymn while we are still standing outside the door
When everyone is sitting down, we can fellowship about the problems we encountered that day and pray for one another
In conclusion, we should not wait for anyone to take the lead in the small group meetings, nor should we wait for others to begin speaking
If the new ones wait for us to answer the question, we should encourage them to answer the question and not wait for us
If only one person answers a question, he will occupy the entire meeting, and others will not have the opportunity to speak
In this way, everyone will have an opportunity to speak, and the riches within the saints will spontaneously come forth
Even though we use the term small group, it is possible that we do not have the proper understanding of a small group
The small group meetings have mutual fellowship, mutual prayer, mutual care, mutual learning of the truth, and the mutual pursuit of life
In addition, only believing in the Lord Jesus is called believing in the Lord, because in the entire universe only He is Lord'
Jesus is not merely our Savior; He is also our Joshua, who leads us into the good land of Canaan to enjoy all its riches'
In the Lord's Day meeting we can use three minutes to speak this prophecy again so that all the brothers and sisters will be edified
Those who bear responsibility in the small group meetings can learn how to lead their group according to its condition
Or we can visit the saints who are ill or the brothers and sisters who have not been in the meetings for a long time
If we practice the small groups in this way, we will have the increase; we will preach the gospel, visit people, and care for people
After the group is split and two new groups are established, we can go out and lead more new people to salvation
If the group is split, the members will still have a fresh relationship when they see one another on the Lord's Day
The brothers coordinating the gospel work in Taiwan decided that every locality where we are spreading the gospel will be given a van
If we will practice this, by the seventh week we will have at least sixty new believers, and we will not need to continue knocking on doors
If we baptize too many people, we will be unable to spend sufficient time to labor on them, and therefore there will be no way to keep them
According to our statistics, about one-fourth of the people who are baptized remain and come to the Lord's Day meetings
The rest of the ones who are baptized do not remain, because we do not have enough serving ones to spend sufficient time to labor on them
If the six people laboring in a locality lead sixty people to salvation, they must spend the time to labor on the new ones and raise them up
Initially, everyone in the team is polite, but as the members spend more time together, everyone's peculiarities are manifested
In order to avoid the arguing, we must be in life; otherwise, even if everyone signs a contract agreeing not to argue, it will not help
We hope that we can resolve our many practical problems and difficulties so that we will have the peace to labor
Rather, their speaking enabled the Holy Spirit to work in people, and this operation of the Spirit caused people to change
When they went out to preach the gospel and lead sinners to salvation, they were distributing, dispensing, Christ into people
According to their records, the full-timers baptized seven hundred fifty to eight hundred people in two months
These brothers and sisters were like orphans without a home or without a proper dwelling place, because there was no church in their town
These fifteen places now bear the testimony of the golden lampstand; that is, there is a church in these localities
In considering the practical situation, we feel that there is much room for improvement; we need to endeavor to do better
The saints responsible for making arrangements are renting and furnishing places that will be suitable to use as a base
By the time the second wave of saints is ready to set out, there will be twelve towns or villages ready for them
There are a total of one hundred thirty saints laboring on the island of Taiwan for the propagation of the Lord's recovery
These are college graduates who have gone through substantial spiritual training and are willing to come forth for the Lord's move
It is truly marvelous that in this day and age so many full-time serving ones can be produced from among college graduates
The Lord has particularly blessed the situation in Taiwan, in that the island is small, and the people are educated
If it were not for the hundreds of college students who are joining Calvary's hosts, the Lord's spreading work would not be able to proceed
Our heart rejoices to see one hundred thirty college graduates who are trained and can be sent to labor in various places
Before the saints go to specific destinations, there is detailed planning, much prayer, and sufficient preparation
Now two more saints are being added in each place, and this doubles the manpower to labor together in coordination
From now on the four people in each base will not be moved to another place; they will labor in one place for four months
We hope that after four months there will be about forty saints in each locality who are regular and steady in the church life
We can then move two of the full-timers to another place, and two can remain in the new locality for the long term
There are four full-timers stationed in each of the initial fifteen places, and the twelve new places will have six full-timers each
If we continue spreading according to this pattern, in 1991 we will conclude this stage in the work of evangelizing Taiwan
There will be one hundred newly established churches and two full-time serving ones in every church for a total of two hundred full-timers
We need to continue adding more full-timers until there are two hundred full-timers laboring in the new churches
The newly trained graduates can also replace those who have labored six months or longer in the towns and villages
There are many colleges and universities in Taiwan, and people on this small island live in a clustered environment
In particular, those who are laboring on the campuses in Taiwan need to gain college students with this in view
Every new group of apprentices who are raised up will follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before them
The churches in Taiwan can enter into an atmosphere of propagation and increase for God's pleasure and satisfaction
When we knock on doors, we should not let the sisters baptize males, but the sisters can be allowed to baptize females
The first wave of saints who went to the towns and villages were equipped with two ten-passenger vans per team
In a locality where forty people meet together, if half of them require a ride, we will only need to make two trips
The vans will all be of the same make and the same shape with a logo, such as 'God loves the world' or 'Jesus is Lord,' painted on them
When these one hundred vans travel from town to town, the townspeople will know that these are the gospel vans of the local churches
By improving our arrangement in the work and by taking care of housing, we have taken care of the full-timers in every way
A small group can begin with seven or eight people and gradually increase in number until it can be split into two groups
In particular, we must bring them to the big meeting on Lord's Day morning for them to practice prophesying together with all the saints
In conclusion, we need to preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, and we need to nourish the new believers
In the past we emphasized knocking on doors to visit people and baptize them, but now we must emphasize these four steps
During our time to spread the gospel if we use this day to go on an outing we will not get any rest and we will be more exhausted afterwards
On this day they were not allowed to walk very far; hence, in Acts there is the phrase a Sabbath day's journey
After going on an outing, people are generally exhausted, and they do not have the energy to go to work or school the next day
They need one day every week to be calm before the Lord in personal prayer in order to contact and fellowship with the Lord
In summary, the full-timers should not walk farther than a Sabbath day's journey, because this violates the principle of rest
The full-timers should spend their mornings reading the Bible, studying the truth, or reading spiritual books for the pursuit of life
They should use their time to go out and knock on doors if they do not have a prayer meeting or a small group meeting
If one gospel team of three can gain five people in one week, the entire team of six saints can gain ten people
If the teams gain ten people in one week, they should be able to gain one hundred people in the first ten weeks
We must first do a nourishing work, and then we must perfect, teach, edify, and cultivate the new ones in the small groups
In the past even though we baptized thousands of people, not many remained, because we did not nourish, teach, perfect, or cultivate them
During these seven weeks the fulltimers can form several teams and each team can visit at least two households a day to care for two people
Regardless of whether the full-timers are nourishing or perfecting, they can care for two people a day and ten people in five days
As soon as we enter a new one's home and sit down, we should exercise our spirit by praying or singing out loud so that our spirit rises up
By this mutual asking and answering we may be led to a particular lesson in Life Lessons that is an appropriate response to the question
We should not leave as soon as the new one is nourished; instead, we should fellowship with him and talk to him
Every lesson in Life Lessons has a hymn at the end that is appropriate to sing in coordination with our speaking
When we visit people in their homes, we must stir up their spirit, but in order to do this, our spirit must first be stirred up
In chapter 4, when Peter and John were released from jail, they went to the brothers, who immediately rejoiced, praised, and prayed out loud
When Peter and John were in custody, the Jewish Sanhedrin charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus
As we have already fellowshipped, organic building requires organic preaching, organic nourishing, and organic perfecting
On the one hand, the small group meetings emphasize fellowship, and this fellowship should not have regulations
Some questions will be concerning our living, concerning life, and other questions will be related to the Bible, concerning the truth
If we have twenty people in our group, after five or six months of perfecting, many of them should be able to do what we do
The new ones will not only have the nourishing of the home meetings but also the perfecting of the small group meetings
After six months they can go out to gain the second generation; then in another six months, another generation will be produced
People have listened to messages on the Lord's Day for ten to twenty years without experiencing much growth in life
As a result, the second generation, third generation, and the following generations will be the same as the first generation
In other words, one small group will become two small groups, and then it will become four, eight, and eventually twelve small groups
Everyone will be able to preach the gospel, prophesy, and establish churches; that is, everyone will function as an apostle
Among these five thousand saints, there are about one thousand elderly saints who need to pray much for the Lord's new way
Apart from the elderly saints, the young people who are under the age of eighteen are able to knock on doors, but they are not experienced
If we do not include these two categories of saints, there are about three thousand saints who can go out to knock on doors
During the first six months we will labor to produce the first generation and in the second six months we will produce the second generation
If we continue in this way, we will not merely gospelize Taipei, but we will spread to every corner of the city
The population of the city of Taipei is equivalent to two hundred towns with a population of ten thousand people each
The church in Taipei needs three hundred full-time serving ones in addition to the five thousand saints in the church
According to the revelation in the book of Acts, everyone who is raised up and sent out by the Lord is a witness of the Lord
The word witnesses is not related to our normal understanding of a witness who gives testimony in a legal case in a law court
In the New Testament the meaning of a witness is primarily to bear a living testimony of Jesus Christ in His crucifixion and resurrection
When Peter stood and spoke for God, his expression, spirit, and fearless attitude demonstrated that the living Jesus was within him
When Peter was speaking, he was a living witness of the fact that the crucified and resurrected Jesus lived within him
Many Bible readers do not have this understanding of the word witness; even our understanding is not this deep
The Lord's death delivers us from the world, sin, and Satan; it also delivers us from the self, the flesh, lusts, and indwelling sin
After the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead, His spread involved His delivering His seekers from the world, sin, Satan, and the self
Some saints were baptized more than ten years ago and have participated in the church life for seven or eight years
They may even have served the Lord full time for several years, yet they are not completely freed from these seven problems
If we stay in the same house with others, who have the same germs that we have, how can we expect not to have any problems?
It was no longer Paul who lived; even though his name was still Paul, the person living was not Paul, because Paul was crucified with Christ
Not one moment passed by without His being under the killing of the cross, and not one moment passed by without His living in resurrection
We can send out one hundred thirty young people to spread the work, but we dare not send out even three older people
People in their thirties are difficult, middle-aged saints are difficult, and even the elderly saints are difficult
A church that is experienced in providing hospitality knows that it might receive criticism from guests who are close to the age of sixty
We should not judge one another and say that this sister has a strong disposition or that that brother is stubborn
Others may be strong on the outside, but we are strong within, or they may be stubborn outwardly, but our stubbornness is within
To a person on the cross, cold water is as good as hot water, and food that is overdone is as good as food that is not well cooked
We will give people a good impression, an excellent testimony; we will testify of the crucified and resurrected Christ
If we are not on the cross after we stay in a new ones home for two weeks he will see through us and will no longer receive us into his home
Whether their children cry or whether they rise early or late, we will not be bothered, and our sleep will not be affected
Brother Nee could have requested bedding, but how would this have affected his testimony of a crucified living?
We can request what is rightfully ours, but we will not have the experience of dying with Christ in His crucifixion
A witness of Christ is a person who daily lives under the shadow of the cross by being in death and resurrection
The chorus says, 'If no death, no life, / If no death, no life; / Life from death alone arises; / If no death, no life'
When people see the gospel vans and the ambassadors of the gospel, may they think of You and smell Your fragrance
Cause Your name to be known to every family and every household in Taiwan so that they will receive You and be saved
Through their speaking, singing, praying, and calling on Your name in the homes, kindle the fire of the gospel in all the villages in Taiwan
