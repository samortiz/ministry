   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNLOADED TO ENTER INTO ROMANS EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But if you come to Romans 8 with anything you have picked up, you can never enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must be unloaded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you want to enter into Romans 8 and touch its depths, you must be so pure, so clean, and so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT IN A PURE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The components of the leading of the Spirit are the law, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to understand these components of the leading of the Spirit in a pure way with nothing added.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It shouldn t be the law plus some definition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And it should not be the Spirit with some means or channels or organs to touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It should be just life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although you may consider that you are clear concerning the components of the leading of the Spirit, I would ask whether you have walked and lived according to these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The leading of the Spirit is just the composition of these three things: the divine life plus the spontaneous function of this life, plus the divine Person who is this law and who is also this life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three things all are within us simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether you are a new believer or an aged, experienced believer, they are within you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether you feel you have these three, or you don t feel you have these three things, they are in you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The divine life is in you, and its function, the law, is in you, and the divine Person is also in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These three can never be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They remain all the time together, and they remain in you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three things remaining in you are the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You don t need to seek after a leading, and you don t need to create or build up a leading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a leading is in you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRACTICES OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are willing all the time to put to death the practices of your mortal body, not only is the leading in you, but also you are led.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You don t need to seek after the leading, and you don t need to take the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as you put the practices of your mortal body to death, you are led.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is somewhat like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever you go, the air is here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is with you, and it is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You don t need to seek after the air.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What many Christians call the leading of the Lord actually is not the genuine leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a kind of leading built up by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE GENUINE LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The genuine leading is nothing less or nothing more than the divine life plus its function, the law, and the divine Person, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three things which remain in you all the time wherever you go and whatever you do are the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You don t need to seek to be led.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is in you already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as you put to death all the practices, all the deeds, all the doings, of your mortal body, you are led.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are in the genuine leading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>LEADING ACCORDING TO OUR PREFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me say something very soberly and very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you consider a little concerning your past, you would realize that many of the so-called leadings were not so genuine; they were made up by you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The genuine leading was there, yet you wouldn t take it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You left the genuine leading, and you were seeking some other kind of leading.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes you even came to the Word in your seeking the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you needed some leading concerning your marriage perhaps you read Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So that kind of leading was made up by your choosing of the verses you preferred.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the leading you found in the verses, you added your prayer, also out of your preference.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You read the verses and you prayed, and then it seemed that the Lord s leading was confirmed by your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Surely you got some confirmation because your prayer built up the kind of leading you preferred to have.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So the genuine leading was there, but you wouldn t care for it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes you may have been careful because you heard that God wouldn t do anything in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So after reading the verses and after praying you felt you should wait a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The waiting and waiting eventually strengthened and confirmed the leading you got.</S>
