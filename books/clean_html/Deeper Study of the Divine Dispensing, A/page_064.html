<p>I hope that all the brothers and sisters, whether old or young, whether they were saved recently or have served the Lord for a long time, would all see a vision. Today, God has no intention for us to do anything by ourselves. It is true that whatever He wants us to do we should do. But God wants us to do everything by depending on Him, by taking Him as life, and by allowing Him to dispense Himself into us. When we enjoy Him and experience Him, we can express Him. This is what God is after. When you go home, you do not need to make up your mind. All you need to do is to sit quietly before the Lord. You do not need to kneel down. This does not mean that we must not kneel down. It means that to kneel down is not a necessity. If you remain quietly before the Lord, and allow your spirit to reflect within you the light you saw in the last few days, you will realize that what you need and lack is not to do something, but to receive His dispensing day by day. You need to receive the Lord’s word every day, and contact His Spirit. In this way, the Lord will become your supply. If you have a bad temper, and are used to losing your temper at your wife and children, you may think, “After listening to these few messages, I feel really shameful. I have been a Christian for twenty-eight years. Today I still get mad at my wife and children. This is to my shame. When I go home, I have to fast for three days and ask the Lord to save me, to have pity on me, and to change my temper. I do not have the strength in myself. I cannot do it. But I am willing to trust in the Lord and to ask Him to change me.” I can tell you that this prayer will surely not be answered. This kind of prayer is an insult to God. He wants to enter into you to become you, and to replace you. You have to hand yourself over to Him. He will then give Himself to you. He will live a grafted life with you. When two trees are grafted together, they do not exchange their lives. Rather, the two lives are mingled as one life, and the two trees are mingled as one tree. Both are living, yet they do not live separately. Rather, they live mutually within one another. The grafted branch lives in the tree and the tree lives in the grafted branch. The two lives become one life, and the two livings become one living. This is the grafted life, and is also the mingled life.<p>Galatians 2:20 speaks of such a life. After saying, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live,” it says, “But Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith….” The living which I now live is a living in which Christ is living Himself out from me. It is true that Christ lives, but He lives in us. We need to see clearly that what the Lord desires is that we and He would be mingled as one. The Lord is our person, and we are His expression; the two become one. “But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit” (1 Cor. 6:17). The center of all of Paul’s epistles with their thousands of words and instructions is this: Christ living in us and being expressed through us. We do not need to do or to perform anything. This is the stewardship that Paul received. For the past two thousand years, he has been doing this work of dispensing on earth. Although he is not with us today, his word is still here. Although he has passed away, he is still speaking. Through these speakings, the riches of the pneumatic Christ are dispensed little by little into us. In this way, Christ increases in us, and through this increase we grow in life. In this growth, our self, our natural man, is diminished and annulled, and we are delivered from ourselves and are joined to the saints to be built into God’s habitation, which is the church.
