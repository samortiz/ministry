<P>Clement of Alexandria thought that John returned from his exile after Domitian's death, which was in A.D. 96. In his book, Eusebius mentioned three times that John's exile was during the reign of Domitian, and he believed that it was in the fourteenth year of Domitian's reign, which was A.D. 95, when John received the Revelation.</P><P>Victorinus was martyred in A.D. 303. His commentary on the book of Revelation is one of the oldest books of its kind in existence. He expounded on Revelation 10:11—"You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings"—in this way: "John spoke in such a way, because he was on the island of Patmos and saw this vision; that is, he was exiled there by Caesar Domitian to do hard labor in the mines. It was there he received the revelation. Since he was already in his old age he wanted to be with the Lord and be delivered from his tribulation in peace. Because Domitian was killed, all his ordinances were abolished. Therefore, after John was released from the mines, he announced the revelation he had received from the Lord." In his book, he explained that the sixth of the eight kings in chapter seventeen was Domitian, so the book of Revelation must have been written during the reign of Domitian.</P><P>Jerome testified in the fourth century that "the time when John wrote Revelation was during his stay on the island of Patmos, which was the fourteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Domitian (A.D. 95). Domitian was the second emperor that persecuted Christians; Nero was the first one."</P><P>It was not until the second half of the fourth century that Epiphanius appeared to express a different view. He said that John returned when he was ninety years old; that was during the reign of Claudius. Claudius was supposedly killed by someone in A.D. 54. If John was ninety years old in A.D. 54, then he would have been approximately thirty-three years older than our Lord. Because our Lord was already thirty years old in A.D. 27, He would have been fifty-seven years old (if He were alive on earth) in A.D. 54. If John was ninety years old at this time, then would he not have been thirty-three years older than our Lord? If this were true, and because the Bible records that our Lord was already thirty years old when He began to call the disciples, then when John became one of the disciples, he would have been already in his sixties! Every student of the Bible knows that he could not have been that old. Therefore, the theory in favor of Claudius' time is illogical. Mr. Pember said, "Epiphanius was one of the most careless and least accurate ancient writers."</P><P>From all these external evidences, we have sufficient proof that Revelation was written at the time of Domitian. Other than the above cases, we still have countless examples of ancient authors who agreed that it was written at this time.</P><P>While the external evidence is quite strong, the internal evidence is not weak either. What I mean by internal evidence is the testimony in the Word. In other words, the book of Revelation itself proves that it was written at the time of Domitian.</P><P>If we say Revelation was written at the time of Nero, it would have happened only five or six years after the time of Paul. The seven letters in Revelation 2 and 3 indicate the actual circumstances of the churches at the time Revelation was written. Those circumstances had to be the circumstances of the churches at least twenty or thirty years after Paul, rather than five or six years after him. Hence, the concept which favors the writing to be at the time of Nero must be incorrect. Revelation 2:14 says that "you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam." What this verse says was established during the time of Domitian. Before this time, there was no fact to match chapter two verse 14.</P><P>John said, "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" (1:9). This verse is especially related to the circumstances of the churches, because at that time there was in the church in Pergamos a martyr named Antipas. The believers in Smyrna were going through a big test of their faith. They were tested perhaps even unto death. The situation described in 2:10 shows that there was persecution in Asia. This could not have been Nero's persecution; it must be Domitian's, since the method of Nero's persecution was by killing, while that of Domitian was mostly by banishment. Furthermore, Nero's persecution took place only around the city of Rome; Domitian's persecution reached throughout Asia.</P><P>Although Jezebel did have a great deal of power in Thyatira before, the record of 2:20-21 shows that by the time Revelation was written, the Lord had already given her the opportunity to repent.</P><P>From these two evidences, the external and the internal, we can prove that Revelation must not have been written during the reign of Nero. Rather, it must have been written during the reign of Domitian. This was A.D. 95 or 96.</P><P>Since Revelation is a book of prophecy (1:3), some idealists try to place the time of writing at Nero's reign for the purpose of showing that all the prophecies were fulfilled in the person of Nero and in the circumstances encountered by the Christians at that time. However, we know this book was written after the time of Nero, and since this is a book of prophecy, their theory consequently fell through. Up until today, this book is still a book of prophecy. It is neither a history in allegories nor a book of fulfilled prophecies.</P><P>We have already proved that this book was written at the time of Domitian. Therefore, the whole strategy of the idealists, whose plan was to take away this fearful book, which is one of the sharpest swords of the Holy Spirit, has failed.</P>
