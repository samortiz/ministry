For the homes we should keep the principle that we are a loving people. We are trying to gain people, to bear fruit. Therefore, we should not regulate the brothers and sisters. We must study the way we take in the homes. In education there are at least six levels: kindergarten, elementary school, middle or junior high school, high school, college, and graduate school. We treat these six kinds of students in six different ways. What we exercise over the high schoolers, we should not exercise over the kindergarten students. If we do, we may kill them. Likewise, what we practice with the kindergarten students, we should not practice with the elementary students. We have to change our way or we will spoil them.</p> <p>No child under six likes to play mainly with adults. They prefer to play with others who are under six. Even on the campus, those who labor there should not be too old. If they are too old, no one will come to them. The students may run away because they are afraid of older people. A young man may feel uncomfortable with old men, but when someone his own age comes, he is happy. This illustrates that we cannot have the same regulation for people of different ages. We must classify people. We should have some homes for those in their first year, and gradually we can advance from there up to the fourth year. Those who have stayed with us for several years have been growing in the Lord, and they can now live a corporate life. In order to prevent some from feeling superior or inferior when we classify them, we must do it wisely. When parents raise their children, they exercise a certain way with each one. To open up a kindergarten is not easy. The government has many regulations for nurseries and kindergartens. A nursery, for example, must care for the children&rsquo;s health and avoid contagious diseases. We should not take a simple way. We cannot avoid a feeling of superiority among the young people, just as the students in high school feel superior about being in high school. Therefore, we need spirituality. We have to teach them to deny the self and many other matters. This is not easy, and it requires much study. I would ask the brothers who set up the homes for the brothers and sisters to please reconsider the way we take. We cannot do things in a simple way. Educators know the psychology of students; they know the difference between kindergarten, elementary, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school. We must be careful in these matters.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED FOR FURTHER TRAINING AND LEARNING</h2><p>I expect that I could have a further time with the elders to train them how to behave as elders. I take care of two annual trainings, and formerly I had to write thirty messages for thirty meetings. I also needed to travel much abroad, and recently I became ill due to traveling. Therefore, since I came to this country, I did not have much time to sit down with the elders to speak in this way. The brothers who are elders in the United States are probing for the way to be good elders, but they do not know what to do. Not one of us was born knowing everything. Therefore, we need to learn, practice, and be educated. Even the two-year full-time training makes a big difference, but so many elders have not been trained. I spoke of some of these things in <i>The Elders&rsquo; Management of the Church,</i> but I did not have the time to look into all these matters very much. I now question whether <i>management</i> was the right word to use in that book. Our use of this word was also due to my lack of time to look into all these matters. What does &ldquo;the elders&rsquo; management&rdquo; mean? The church is not a bank or a corporation that needs a manager. For practical reasons, we have a manager in the Living Stream Ministry office, but there is no rank in this office.</p><p>We need very much fellowship so we can learn. There is much profit for brothers from one part of the country to visit another, not to teach or merely to learn but simply to observe. Likewise, it is a big help to travel to another country and stay there for some time. In this way we can learn much. I have been traveling throughout the whole world, and I have learned much. I truly learned something from the Japanese, and I learned something further from the Koreans. We should never merely be natives of our own country. We should try to go out and learn.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDING,<br />ESPECIALLY BY CHERISHING</h2><p>To me, shepherding means everything for the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes, for the vital groups, for the church, and for the elders. In Christian teaching, nearly no one stresses this matter, but it is a great matter. The Lord is not only our Shepherd and Overseer outwardly; He is also the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls (1 Pet. 2:25). I have stressed this in the <i>Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John.</i></p><p>Today in the United States it is very hard to teach school. Even professors have to study how to shepherd their students. If they do not shepherd them, they may have serious problems. The first point of shepherding is cherishing. Ephesians 5 tells us that the Lord cherishes and nourishes the church, His Body. Without cherishing, nourishing by itself does not work. Today I handle things and do things very differently from the way I did thirty years ago. Within these thirty years I have learned much, even related to dealing with my children. We are touching society, and we are touching human beings. This is not a simple matter, so we must learn.</p><p>We may do the work of the ministry, but the unfitting manner in which we behave and conduct ourselves kills our ministry. Recently, a graduate student in a certain university attacked his three professors because they would not pass him. We cannot say that these professors were not responsible in part for this. If they had spoken softly and wisely, their student would not have been provoked to such an extent. Those professors were trying their best to help this student, but the result was the opposite. Many other professors who heard of this tragedy will now learn to be careful in dealing with students. In principle, it is the same with us. The result, the issue, of our work very much depends on our way of conducting ourselves. We are taking care of the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes, but how do we conduct ourselves, how do we behave, and what way do we take? Even in caring for our children, if we are angry, we will provoke them. We must not do that. Ephesians is a very high book, but it comes down to say, &ldquo;Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation&rdquo; (4:26). If we had written Ephesians, we may not have added this word. We may have spoken only the high peaks in the first three and a half chapters of this book, but Paul came down from the high peaks in the second half of chapter four and chapters five and six. These portions are very meaningful. Similarly, James says, &ldquo;The wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God&rdquo; (1:20).</p><p>John 10 and 21 are chapters on shepherding. Chapter ten speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s coming as the Shepherd. He is the Shepherd, and He is the door in and the door out to the pasture. In 10:10 He says, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly,&rdquo; and in verse 11 He says, &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd.&rdquo; He also says that He lays down His human life for the sake of shepherding. To give life requires shepherding. Without shepherding, it is hard for the divine life to work within us. Chapter twenty-one is a very important appendix on shepherding. John is a book on the divine life, but the divine life depends upon shepherding. Even in our human life, family life, and marriage life there is the need of shepherding, and shepherding requires cherishing. Husbands and wives need to cherish each other all the time. If a couple does not know how to cherish each other, they will have trouble. Parents also need to shepherd their children. If shepherding could be practiced everywhere, the whole of society would become a utopia. Misunderstandings and oppositions mainly come from the shortage of shepherding. We the co-workers must learn to cherish people.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
