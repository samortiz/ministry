   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NINE ITEMS OF SALVATION IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us first consider the nine items of salvation in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first item is the law of the Spirit of life freeing us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second item is the subjective and dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The third item is the renewing of the mind, resulting in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fourth item is the building up in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fifth item is the conformation to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are the five basic items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>None of these five items are things we have ever thought of in our own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you return to your localities, you have to teach the new ones properly, item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After these five items of saving, there are four results: reigning in life, living in the church life, crushing Satan under our feet, which brings in God's kingdom, and our bodies being redeemed and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE FREEING US</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life denotes the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit denotes the resurrected Christ who has been transformed into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law is the natural capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every matter has its nature, and within its nature is a power, a capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, steel and iron have the capacity to be very hard, resistant, and durable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They can also sever and cut things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are their capacities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But wood has a different capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law of the Spirit of life within us also has its nature, its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It also has its natural capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This capacity is the person of the pneumatic Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This law is personified; it is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, this law is just the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is not just a thing, but a person who frees us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sin is also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can never overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the law of the Spirit of life releases us and gives us freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The law of sin and of death is also personified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It denotes the sin in our sinful nature, not the sins in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sin in our nature is the evil nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It causes us to have the ability to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Death and sin may be considered as twins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where sin is, death is always there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sin causes man to have the ability to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Death comes from sin and disables man from doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These twins reside in man, causing him to be weak in performing good, but strong in committing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, man is finished and cannot do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the condition of man since the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul describes this pitiful condition of man in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the end of the description, he said that he was a wretched man v. 24 without any strength to overcome the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD MAKING THE THREE PARTS OF OUR BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How does the Triune God turn the three parts of our being into life?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Romans 8 we first see that the Spirit of Christ is the pneumatic Christ, who has entered into our spirit to make our spirit life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our spirit has been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our spirit has not only been made alive, it has also become life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit has "life-ized'' our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Second, the Spirit is mingled with our spirit to become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This mingled spirit then spreads into our mind the main part of our soul that surrounds our spirit and makes our mind life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that when we set our mind on the spirit, our mind is life v. 6b . Third, the resurrecting and indwelling Spirit of God reaches our body v. 11 , resulting in our body receiving the dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The way our whole person is turned into life is from the center to the circumference, from the spirit through the soul to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First, God makes our spirit alive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then, He makes our soul alive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Finally, He makes our body alive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ultimately, all three parts our spirit, soul, and body become life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At present, we can experience our spirit and soul coming alive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But our body has not been fully transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When our body is redeemed and in glory, it will also be fully alive.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, it will become life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today, at times we are weak in our body and sick.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By exercising our spirit, our body can be somewhat strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a foretaste of our body becoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>THE COOPERATION WE SHOULD RENDER</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, we have to set our mind on the spirit Rom 8:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Second, we have to walk only according to the spirit Rom 8:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Third, we have to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whatever the body desires to do, we would reject.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must wait on the order from the Spirit before we allow the body to act.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suppose you know that it is not good to go to the cinema and that it is good to go to the meeting hall for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You must remember that if you decide out of your own will to go to the meeting hall, it is still death.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your going to the meeting hall must be the result of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why you have to put to death the practices of the body, whether they be good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have to tell the Lord, "Lord, I would not go to the cinema, nor would I go to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I would go wherever You want me to go.''</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the Lord wants you to go to the meeting hall, you may go there.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But which meeting hall should you go to?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Should it be Hall Three, or Hall Nine?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you choose by yourself, then it is your own move again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You must stop and allow the Spirit to give you the leading within.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Perhaps the Lord would not want you to go to Hall Three or Hall Nine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Perhaps He would lead you to go to Hall Two.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When you go this way, it will be the move of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must not merely do good works; we must follow the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must walk only according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is our necessary cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I hope that when you go back to your localities, you can explain these riches to the new ones you are helping.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you do this, you will be a faithful minister of Christ, able to plant the living word into man.</S>
