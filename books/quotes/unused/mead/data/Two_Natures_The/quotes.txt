[1]  A great number of people who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior have discovered a new experience soon after they have believed: in their hearts it seems that there are two natures.
[2]  My dear brothers, do you have the experiences we have mentioned?
[3]  Before we speak of our present condition, we should first understand the kind of person we were before we believed in the Lord.
[4]  After understanding the origin of the flesh and how the flesh is just our sinful nature, we can now consider the character of this flesh.
[5]  After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, God does not leave us to walk according to the old sinful nature, that is, the flesh.
[6]  One is the sinful nature, the flesh, which is the nature of old Adam.
[7]  With the new nature as a contrast, the old nature is exposed to be evil, worldly, and devilish.
[8]  Because the old nature, with the passing of time, has become so deeply intertwined with the person himself, it takes quite a period of time to remove this old nature in experience.
[9]  Since the old nature is strong and the new nature weak, a person often ends up doing what he does not desire to do and not doing what he does desire to do.
[10]  Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh.
[11]  If we reckon this way, we will see the cross freeing us, and the flesh will become powerless.
[12]  It is true that once we reckon ourselves dead, we will experience instant victory.
[13]  While you are reading, you can exercise your faith to reckon yourself dead to sin, and you can pray that the Holy Spirit of the Lord will apply the cross of the Lord Jesus deeply in you, so that you can overcome sin in your experience.
