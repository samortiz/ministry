   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 Having No Confidence in Their Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, in serving and worshipping God the believers should have no confidence in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul says that those who serve by the Spirit of God "have no confidence in the flesh" Phil 3:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The flesh here comprises all that we are and have in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They trusted in their natural qualities and qualifications, not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By contrast, Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may think that to trust in the flesh simply means to trust in the fallen human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is actually not the meaning of "flesh" in Philippians 3:3b.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After saying that we should not have any confidence in the flesh, Paul goes on to say that he was circumcised on the eighth day, that he was of the race of Israel, that he was of the tribe of Benjamin, that he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, that according to the law he was a Pharisee, that according to zeal he persecuted the church, and that according to the righteousness of the law he was blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these things were aspects of Paul's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we may think that the flesh includes only evil things but not good things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, the honorable, lovable, and superior aspects of our natural being are still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything Paul did according to the law and according to zeal was flesh and of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even his righteousness according to the law was flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the characteristics listed by Paul in Philippians 3:4-6 are aspects of the flesh because they are all natural and are neither of Christ nor of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anything natural, whether it is good or evil, is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Judaizers trusted in their flesh, trusting in what they were by their natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But as believers in Christ we should not trust in anything we have by our natural birth, for everything of our natural birth is part of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to render genuine service and worship to God, everything we do must be by the Spirit of God, in Christ, and with no trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we are not Judaizers, in principle we may actually be the same as the Judaizers were.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though we have been regenerated, we may continue to live in our fallen nature, boast in what we do in the flesh, and have confidence in our natural qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, it is important that we be deeply and personally touched by these verses in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need the Lord's light to shine on us concerning our nature, our deeds, and our confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are enlightened by the Lord, we shall confess that although we have been regenerated to become children of God with the divine life and nature, we still live too much in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day, when the light shines on you concerning this, you will want to prostrate yourself before the Lord and confess how unclean your nature is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you will condemn everything you do by your fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will see that in the eyes of God whatever is done in the fallen nature is evil and worthy of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Formerly, we boasted in our deeds and qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the time will come when instead of boasting in the flesh with its qualifications, we shall condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we shall boast in Christ alone, realizing that in ourselves we have absolutely no ground for boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only when we have been enlightened by God shall we be able to say truly that we have no trust in our natural qualifications, ability, or intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only then shall we be able to testify that our confidence is wholly in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we are enlightened in this way, we shall truly serve and worship God in our spirit and by the Spirit.</S>
