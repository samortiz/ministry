	 <h2 class="head2">The Spirit of God</h2>
<p>The Spirit is not only life and the law of the Spirit of life, but He is also God (v. 9). We need to see that God in Romans 8 includes more than God in Genesis 1. In Genesis 1:1 God did not have the human nature, for He had not yet become a man or lived a human life, nor had He passed through death and entered into resurrection and ascension. In Genesis 1 God was merely God, but in Romans 8 He is both God and man, and He has been fully processed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Traditional systematic theology says that God is ever the same, that God never changes from eternity to eternity. It is true that God in His essence never changes. However, God in His economy did undergo a change when He became a man (John 1:1, 14; cf. Isa. 9:6; Matt. 1:23). Incarnation surely was a change. In resurrection God in Christ underwent another change&mdash;He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). God took one step in incarnation to become a man, and He took a second step in resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit. Because God has been processed, the Spirit of God is all-inclusive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 8 also mentions the Spirit of Christ (v. 9). This title contains a marvelous revelation. In Greek <em>Christ</em> means &ldquo;anointed One.&rdquo; As God&rsquo;s anointed One, Christ was appointed by God to do a great work. In order to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, Christ died on the cross to cleanse us from our sins, redeem us, and terminate the entire old creation. Then He resurrected to germinate God&rsquo;s selected people with the divine life. The Spirit of Christ includes all these accomplishments.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of the Resurrecting One</h2>
<p>The Spirit in Romans 8 is also the Spirit of the resurrecting One. As the resurrecting One, the Spirit is resurrection. Today He is within us continually resurrecting us. He has resurrected our spirit, and now He is resurrecting our mind, emotion, will, and body by infusing us with the divine life. This infusion may be compared to an injection used to administer medicine, which provides immediate and effective care. Many Christians today trust in teaching to enable them to have proper human relationships. No matter how much we are taught to be a good husband, wife, son, daughter, or roommate, we cannot do it by our natural strength. What we need is not teaching but the infusion of the Spirit. When we contact the Lord, even simply by calling on His name, we receive an infusion of life into our being. As a result, we do not need to make up our mind to be a good person. Rather, a proper living will spontaneously be produced by the life that has been infused into us. The proper Christian life is a matter not of doing but of living.</p>
<p>The life that the Spirit infuses into us is God Himself. Likewise, the Spirit and the law of the Spirit of life are God Himself. The mystery in the entire universe is that the Triune God is working Himself into us. What we need is not religion or teaching but the Triune God infusing us with Himself as life. We need to realize that God&rsquo;s intention and His economy are not to teach, change, or improve us but to infuse Himself into us as life day by day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Indwelling Spirit</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work of infusing us with Himself as our life is carried out by the all-inclusive Spirit, who indwells us. The root of the word <em>indwell</em> is related to the word for <em>house.</em> Therefore, to indwell means to reside in. In Greek the expression <em>indwelling</em> is even stronger than <em>dwells in.</em> Paul first says that the Spirit of God dwells in us (vv. 9, 11a), but he ends by saying that the Spirit indwells us (v. 11b). A living person, the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One, indwells us.</p>
<p>A wedding or engagement ring is a sign to others that the wearer is not available but is fully occupied by another person. The Bible reveals that the indwelling Spirit is such a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; to us, indicating to the enemy and all others that we belong to God and are occupied by Him. Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:2). To be betrothed is to be engaged. Because we have been engaged to Christ, we have received the indwelling Spirit as an engagement ring. In Luke 15 when the prodigal son came home, the father gave him a robe, sandals, and a ring (v. 22). The ring signifies the sealing Spirit. Ephesians 1:13 says that once we believe in the Lord, we receive the Spirit as a seal, which, like an engagement ring, indicates that we belong to God. Thus, we are occupied and sealed, marked out, by the indwelling Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENUINE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE INDWELLING SPIRIT<br />
INFUSING US WITH GOD AS OUR LIFE SUPPLY</h2>
<p>The Triune God has been installed within us. We do not need to try to behave properly or improve our conduct; instead, we only need to take care of the indwelling Spirit, who is God, Christ, the automatically functioning law of the Spirit of life, our life, and our life supply. The indwelling Spirit wants to supply us with God as our life; He desires to constantly infuse us with God. The Spirit of the resurrecting One is within us, resurrecting us with the divine life, which is God Himself. We do not need to change ourselves, because if we allow the all-inclusive Spirit to infuse us with God as life, we will spontaneously be transformed, resurrected, and renewed.</p>
<p>In order to receive the infusion of life from the Spirit, we need only to be open, just as a switch must be on to allow electricity to flow through a circuit. We should always be &ldquo;switched on.&rdquo; For this reason, 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says, &ldquo;Unceasingly pray.&rdquo; Throughout the day we must have our mouth, heart, spirit, and entire being open, calling on the Lord in every place (1 Cor. 1:2). If we keep ourselves open, we will receive the injection, transfusion, and supplying of the Spirit, who is God, Christ, the resurrecting One, the law of the Spirit of life, the life, and the life supply. We will be continually resurrected, renewed, transformed, and sanctified. This is the genuine Christian life according to Romans 8.</p>
<p>We need to realize that the all-inclusive Spirit is within us. We do not need to fast and pray or babble incoherently and hope that God will mercifully send the Spirit. God&rsquo;s way is simple, normal, and practical. At the moment we repented, believed in the Lord, and called on His name, the indwelling Spirit was installed within us. Now we can &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; simply by calling on the Lord. Even if we call softly from a believing heart, we will receive an infusion of God as life from the indwelling Spirit. When we thus experience God as the all-inclusive Spirit, this proves that God is real, true, experiential, and practical.</p>
<p>We do not need to make up our minds or strive to improve ourselves. We need to forget about all such religious things and simply say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You that You have been installed in me as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is God, Christ, the resurrecting One, life, and the law of the Spirit of life, so that I can enjoy and experience You. Keep me calling on You, breathing You in, and always open to You.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, the life supply will be infused into our being, and we will experience, enjoy, and grow with Christ.</p>
