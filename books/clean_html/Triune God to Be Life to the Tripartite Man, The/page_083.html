<P>A saint who has a proper living and who is victorious is one who is always in the divine fellowship, vertically and horizontally, all day long. We must learn to fellowship with the Lord more, and we must also learn to fellowship with the saints more. We must thank the Lord for those around us, and we must endeavor to have fellowship with them. The brothers and sisters should have thorough fellowship with one another, even concerning practical things related to their daily living. We should have fellowship with one another to such an extent. When we fellowship in such a way, we receive the benefit.</P><P>We may feel that we should only fellowship with those around us about the messages we have read or some other spiritual activity. Of course, our fellowship should include this. However, our fellowship should also include many practical things. I have discovered that the biggest shortage among us is fellowship. Our problem is that we do not have the habit to fellowship, and many of us do not like to fellowship. We must realize that when we fellowship, the Lord is involved. When we turn away from fellowship or stop our fellowship with our fellow believers, the Lord is kept away.</P><P>We should try to have fellowship with our fellow believers as much as possible. This divine fellowship not only corrects us; it also molds us and even reconstitutes us. This fellowship brings the divine constituent into our spiritual being, causing a change in our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP BEING THE REALITY<br>OF LIVING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>The divine fellowship is the reality of living in the Body of Christ. The Lord has been frustrated throughout the centuries because of the lack of fellowship. In Revelation 22:20 the Lord Jesus said, "I come quickly," but it has been nearly two thousand years, and the Lord is still not back. The reason is that the believers are individualistic, independent, opinionated, and divisive. The Roman Catholic Church controlled people by its organization, but those who broke away from Catholicism brought in division after division. The believers seem to be like horses without bridles. Today nothing seems to control them. Actually, the divine fellowship should control the believers.</P><P>The one thing which should rule us is the divine fellowship. We are restricted in this fellowship. By being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness, and the work of the ministry continues to go on. When we are out of fellowship, everything is finished. The thing which makes everything alive is fellowship. If we learn to fellowship, we will receive many benefits, especially in the Lord's work.</P>
