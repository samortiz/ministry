[2]  As I had a close and spiritual contact with Brother Watchman Nee for twenty-five years, and as I was involved in the same unique work with him for the Lord's recovery for such a long time, I felt burdened to write a biography for him that the life and work of such a witness of the Lord might not disappear from those after him, but rather might be kept, as it should be, to minister Christ according to God's desire to the generations to come.
[3]  After much consideration, my solution to all these points is this: Since I have been under Brother Nee's teaching, edifying, and perfecting, and since he was a brother I respected, observed, and weighed for a quarter of a century, the accuracy of my writing about him should be guaranteed.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE RAISING UP A UNIQUE GIFT TO THE AGE THE LORD'S MOVE TO CHINA
[5]  In creation God ordained that man should replenish the earth and have dominion over all created things Gen 1:28 .
[6]  In redemption the Lord commissioned His disciples to go into all the world to preach the gospel and disciple all the nations for His kingdom on earth Mark 16:15; Matt 28:19 .
[7]  CHAPTER TWO SAVED AND CALLED THROUGH DORA YU'S PREACHING
[8]  Among the evangelists which the Lord raised up in China was a young sister whose English name was Dora Yu and whose Chinese name was Yu Tzu-tu.
[9]  At that time I was afraid of being saved, for I knew that once I was saved I must serve the Lord.
[10]  After being saved, Watchman Nee had a strong desire to serve the Lord.
[11]  During his school days Watchman Nee's seeking after the Lord brought him into frequent contact with Margaret E. Barber.
[12]  On February 7, 1950, in his fellowship with the church in Hong Kong, he said, "There were sixty-six young people under Sister Barber's training.
[13]  In the first letter I received from Brother D.M. Panton, he said that it would be considered good if after ten years six of those young people would still remain.
[14]  Watchman Nee did not attend a theological school or Bible institute.
[15]  Most of what he learned concerning Christ, the things of the Spirit, and church history was acquired through studying the Bible and reading the books of spiritual men.
[16]  Watchman Nee was not only an excellent student of the Bible; he was also a studious reader of spiritual books.
[17]  Watchman Nee's study of the Bible and his reading of many spiritual books greatly enlightened him regarding God's economy.
[18]  It was according to the revelations which he received from the Lord that he was burdened to work for the Lord.
[19]  He instructed them in how to make a thorough confession of their sins to God, how to be reconciled with others, how to make a full clearance of the past, how to overcome sin, how to forsake the world, how to consecrate themselves to the Lord, how to study the Bible, how to pray, how to lead others to the Lord, how to meet and fellowship with the saints, how to seek the Lord's will, how to follow the inner anointing, how to live by faith, how to renounce the sects, and how to keep the unity of the Body.
[20]  First, he himself learned to know the Lord in a deep way by experiencing His all-inclusive death and resurrection.
[21]  Because of his own experience along this line, he was specifically burdened and commissioned by the Lord to bear testimony to this truth.
[22]  For the discharge of this burden, he released spoken messages and also issued a magazine, called The Present Testimony, in which he published messages on the subjective aspect of the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection, on the principles of life, on the supremacy of Christ, and on God's eternal purpose.
[23]  During the first year following my conversion, I was unclear regarding the truths of the church, except that the sister who led me to the Lord had told me that unfortunately there were too many nominal Christians in the church today.
[24]  In this same year 1921 I went to the Bible regarding a number of questions.
[25]  I said to myself, "There are so many nominal Christians in the present day church, yet the Bible says that only the saved ones are in the church.
[26]  During the latter half of 1922, I uncovered another problem from the Bible the problem of denominations.
[27]  In 1 Corinthians 1 Paul exhorted the Corinthian believers not to be divisive by saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ."
[28]  After I was saved, I spontaneously loved the souls of sinners and hoped that they would be saved.
[29]  I thought the more words I could speak and the more reasons I could present, the more effective I would be in saving people.
[30]  Though some had been saved, I was still not satisfied, because many in the school and in the town were still not saved.
[31]  I felt the need to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to receive power from above that I might be able to bring more people to the Lord.
[32]  One day while seeking a theme from the Bible before delivering a message, I randomly opened the Bible and Psalm 73:25 appeared before my eyes: "Whom have I in heaven but thee?
[33]  I must admit that I did love her, but at the same time I suffered her laughter at the Lord I believed in. I also questioned at that time whether she or the Lord would have first place in my heart.
[34]  At that time Brother Nee wrote the following hymn:
[35]  Following his salvation, Watchman Nee first began bringing people to the Lord, and second he began learning to live in the Lord's presence.
[36]  Whenever he was having a transaction with God regarding a certain matter, God would deal with him regarding the elimination of certain things to maintain his fellowship with God.
[37]  The flesh is the worst part of fallen man and always fights against the Spirit of God Gen 6:3; Gal 5:17 .
[38]  Watchman Nee fully realized this and always stood against his flesh and natural temperament in order to maintain an unbroken fellowship with the Lord and remain in the presence of God.
[39]  In order to keep his fellowship with the Lord untarnished, Watchman Nee learned how to apply the blood of Christ to his situation.
[40]  He told me that once his conscience was strongly condemning him before God concerning certain things.
[41]  From the very beginning, Watchman Nee realized fully that he should live by faith, not only for his living, but also for the Lord's work.
[42]  This forced him to pray much, to consecrate himself to the Lord absolutely, to thoroughly deal with the Lord, and to obey the Lord in everything.
[43]  I have pointed out in a previous testimony that after I was saved I continued to study in school and at the same time work for the Lord.
[44]  I said, "After praying for several days, I feel that I must tell you that I will no longer spend your money.
[45]  But you will expect me to earn money in the future and support you in return, and I must tell you beforehand that since I am going to be a preacher, I will not be able to repay you in the future nor pay you interest.
[46]  In 1923 Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi invited me to preach in Kien-ou in the north of Fukien province.
[47]  I had only about fifteen dollars in my pocket, one-third of the traveling expenses.
[48]  I prayed to the Lord again, "O Lord, if You really want me to give away five dollars, I will," but I was still rather unwilling inwardly.
[49]  Then he said, "When you get back to Foochow, I will give you The Dynamic of Service written by Mr. Paget Wilkes, a gospel messenger greatly used by the Lord in Japan." I soon felt that I had missed a great opportunity; what I needed then was money for traveling expenses, not a book.
[50]  When I left the following day, I had only a few dollars in my pocket.
[51]  Many brothers and sisters came to see me off, and some carried my luggage.
[52]  While walking I prayed, "Lord, surely You wouldn't bring me here without taking me back."
[53]  When I prayed to God, He told me that I am not like a Christian, for I have never done well in the matter of offering, and that I love money too much.
[54]  In Watchman Nee's Narration of the Past, given in a meeting on the Lord's Day, December 4, 1932, he related the same matters in more detail.
[55]  By the end of 1922 I had a burden to publish a magazine, because a number had been saved in Foochow, and the number was increasing.
[56]  In his personal testimony given at Kulangsu on October 20 concerning the above incident, he concluded with the following words:
[57]  Thank God that after I declared to my parents that I would spend their money no longer, I could still go on studying in school for two more years.
[58]  In his second testimony given at Kulangsu, Fukien, on October 20, 1936, he testified of the following:
[59]  Through his fellowship with Margaret Barber, Watchman Nee realized from the very beginning that to be a Christian is altogether a matter of life.
[60]  While staying in Shanghai as an unmarried person, his mother came to stay with him for a period of time.
[61]  Rumors circulated that a woman was living with him.
[62]  Miss Groves, a sister who had previously been a help to him, heard the rumor and came to ask, "Is it true that you have a woman living with you?"
[63]  When I was being tempered together in the service with my co-workers, the Lord ordered many crosses for me.
[64]  Watchman Nee saw that he had been crucified with Christ and that he had risen with Christ.
[65]  It was by the resurrection life of the indwelling Christ that he was able to bear the cross and to participate in the fellowship of His sufferings and be conformed to His death.
[66]  He saw that the church was in a defeated condition, and he felt called by the Lord to be an overcomer in this age so that the Lord might recover His original purpose concerning His church.
[67]  The following words by Sister Ruth Lee in her open letter published in the sixth issue of The Present Testimony, dated December 24, 1928, testifies how Watchman Nee labored in his work by living an overcoming life:
[68]  He realized that God cares for what we are more than what we do, and his work was according to this principle.
[69]  Watchman Nee saw through 1 Corinthians 3:12-15 that the important thing regarding our work is not its quantity but its quality.
[70]  But when I informed them that I was not afraid, Dr. Wong told me that I was afflicted with tuberculosis and that my condition was so serious that prolonged rest would be necessary.
[71]  I felt that even though I might not live long, I should believe that God would increase my strength and that I must work for Him.
[72]  After praying for over a month, I felt that I should write a book concerning what I had learned before God.
[73]  My concept had been that one should not write books until he was old, but when I considered that I might be leaving this earth, I felt I should begin writing.
[74]  When someone told me of this, I said, "Let this be my end. I realize I am going to die soon." One brother telegraphed the churches in various places, telling them there was no more hope for me and that they need pray for me no more.
[75]  About four years ago, I went to an auction at the house of a German doctor.
[76]  Upon inquiring I found that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago.
[77]  When I discovered that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago, I lifted up my hands to praise the Lord.
[78]  When Watchman Nee was a teenager, he fell in love with a young girl by the name of Charity Chang.
[79]  The following is a testimony of Samuel I.L. Chang, Mrs. Nee's brother, concerning Watchman as a businessman:
[80]  I received my college degree in the field of chemistry, and in 1938 I engaged in the pharmaceutical enterprise as an assistant to Watchman Nee's second brother, Hwai-tsu George .
[81]  Four sisters were vital to Watchman Nee in his life and work.
[82]  During my first year in the Girls' Normal College in Wuchang, I experienced some fear of sinning against God, although at that time I was not sure there was a God.
[83]  Not long after this a certain Christian girls' high school offered me the position of dean.
[84]  I realized that I was not right, for I was ambitious and was depending on my strength to work for the Lord.
[85]  A year before I went to Nanking, I fellowshipped with Sister Lee concerning the truth of the church.
[86]  However, since her attitude was very rigid and since she was not at all receptive, I made no further mention of it.
[87]  Later she read a book on church history, saw that the origin of the denominations was not scriptural, and became somewhat clear.
[88]  The following excerpts from her open letters, published in The Present Testimony while substituting for Brother Nee, show to some extent her spiritual weight.
[89]  The more our vision is enlarged to see the eternal will of God, the more joyful and hopeful we are, and the more we need to recognize clearly the boundaries which God has measured to us.
[90]  This last quotation is from the ninth issue of The Present Testimony, published June 20, 1929.
[91]  Our greatest dangers are that we are not willing to ask God to examine all our lives and works, that we are not willing to lay aside our natural ability and opinions and wholly trust in God, and that we are not willing to stop struggling in our failures and weaknesses and look to God alone.
[92]  While studying in the seminary in Nanking, she met Sister Ruth Lee along with other sisters and also Watchman Nee.
[93]  In her work of spreading the Lord's recovery, she was assigned a young sister apprentice to help me in starting the Lord's testimony in Tientsin.
[94]  As a senior of ten years in the work, she sustained me in whatever needs I had in the Lord's work.
[95]  Later, in the turmoil stirred up among the brothers and sisters in Shanghai in 1942, when Watchman was forced to discontinue his ministry, Peace Wang had a clear vision of the real situation from the Lord and stood firmly for the Lord's gift to His church, Watchman Nee.
[96]  Following the long period of trial during which his ministry was discontinued, in our fellowship with him in Shanghai he frequently referred to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[97]  The book of Genesis reveals that by the time Jacob reached the end of his life, he had matured to become Israel.
[98]  We also see a matured life in Watchman Nee after his many experiences with the Lord and much suffering.
[99]  In November of 1948 and February of 1949, Watchman Nee called two urgent conferences in Shanghai for the leading co-workers.
[100]  In this respect he was like the apostle Paul in Acts 20:24: "But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus."
[101]  On a number of occasions when I had personal problems, I went to Watchman Nee for help.
[102]  He preached the gospel to me, explaining that God loved me and gave His only begotten Son for me, and that if I would truly believe in Him, I would not perish but would have eternal life.
[103]  In 1924 I transferred to Nanking University and came under the influence of modernism.
[104]  In 1948 I again had opportunity to attend a conference in the church in Shanghai.
[105]  I was a trainee in Watchman Nee's first training on Kuling Mountain, Foochow, in 1948.
[106]  I attended his training for nearly four months and was greatly helped by him.
[107]  Concerning the matter of healing, we must pay attention to three things: 1 Do not tempt God, 2 Do not accept the symptom, and 3 Believe that the grace is sufficient.
[108]  Whenever Watchman Nee was asked a question, his answer was always practical, to the point, clear, full of anointing, and filled with light.
[109]  He told us about going to Margaret Barber weekly, during his student days, to be rebuked.
[110]  Watchman Nee prayed in a slow way with one or two words coming slowly from his mouth.
[111]  When I was in Chungking, I unconsciously picked up his way of prayer.
[112]  Later, a leading brother rebuked me for that practice and told me that I should not copy another's way of prayer, so I stopped praying that way.
[113]  Elizabeth P. Rademacher was a missionary in Shanghai during World War II and now serves the Lord in the church in Huntington Beach, California, U.S.A. The following is her testimony regarding Watchman Nee:
[114]  The Bible study ended, but the Lord wasn't through with me.
[115]  He believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, even God Himself, incarnated as a man with both the human and the divine life, that He died on the cross to accomplish redemption, that He rose bodily from the dead on the third day, that He ascended into heaven and was enthroned, crowned with glory, and made the Lord of all, and that He will return the second time to receive His followers, to save Israel, and to establish His millennial kingdom on the earth.
[116]  Watchman Nee saw that the real servant of God must live by faith in God and not be hired as the employee of a religious organization.
[117]  Believers are regenerated by the Spirit of God in their spirit, the Spirit of God witnesses with their spirit Rom 8:16 , the Lord Jesus is with their spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , and they are one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .
[118]  In the years 1933 and 1934, Watchman Nee saw that the boundary of the local church is the boundary of the city where the church is.
[119]  The Lord has revealed through Watchman Nee that believers must be practically built up with others in the local churches under the authority of the church.
[120]  Watchman Nee endured much suffering for the sake of his ministry.
[121]  The following excerpts from his open letters in The Christian and in The Present Testimony give a picture of his ill health and the spiritual lessons he learned through it.
[122]  When I hear of the many brothers and sisters scattered in different places who, though they have not met me, yet because of our relationship in the Lord, have wept bitterly before Him for my health, I feel that what you have bestowed upon me is so deep while that which I have given you is so shallow.
[123]  Because of this I cannot help feeling that if I had more life, energy, and time, how much I would like to spend it on the saints.
[124]  Beloved brothers, the time of the Lord's coming back is fast approaching.
[125]  In the days ahead we may suffer more misunderstanding and more severe opposition; but since we have been destined for this we should remain faithful....Brothers, please continue to remember me in your prayers so that in all my afflictions I may be able to stand fast, faithfully bearing a good testimony for the Lord.
[126]  What follows is from the twenty-ninth issue, published in January February 1933:
[127]  The denominations opposed him, attacked him, and did their best to destroy his ministry.
[128]  Two years after the church life began to be practiced in Watchman's home town in 1922, he was excommunicated by his co-workers.
[129]  Among the first three brothers to come into the church in Shanghai in the very beginning, one was very ambitious to be a leader.
[130]  I received your letter of April 7, and found that you had not received my letter, in which I notified you that the things you sent me every time have been received.
[131]  Watchman wrote this letter to his sister-in-law, who was his wife's oldest sister and whom he addressed in the letter as "eldest sister."
[132]  This sister lived in Peking and was away from Mrs. Nee for about twenty years.
[133]  In this letter "Sister Hwei" refers to Watchman's wife, Charity, whose Chinese name is Pin-hwei.
[134]  This letter was written by Watchman to his nephew-in-law.
[135]  It was dated May 26, 1972, only four days before his death.
[136]  In May 1989, after a period of seventeen years, his ashes and the ashes of Mrs. Nee were both transferred by his two nephews from Chekiang to a public cemetery in Shiangshan in the city of Soochow of Kiangsu province.
[137]  We have seen the revelations Watchman Nee received from the Lord and the sufferings he underwent.
[138]  Concerning the church he covered two main points in his ministry: the content of the church and the practice of the church, or in other words, the reality of the church and the practicality of the church.
[139]  Wherever he went, sinners were saved, believers were edified in life, and either the church was strengthened or the way was paved for a church to be established.
[140]  At the end of March 1932, he visited Tsinan, the capital of Shantung province.
[141]  While in Tsinan he spoke to over eighty students at Chi-Loo University who were on a mountain retreat in Taishan.
[142]  In addition to his domestic traveling, he also visited a number of foreign countries.
[143]  Through his personal fellowship, many wanderers were brought back to the Lord, many distracted believers were brought back on track, many defeated saints were recovered to the Lord's victory, many needy persons received the supply of life, and many seeking ones were enlightened to turn to the Lord's recovery.
[144]  We hope that in our future conferences, neither the speaker nor the listeners will bring up, either publicly or privately, any matters outside the victory of Christ, in order that we might have God's full blessing....This does not mean that other matters are not important; but it does mean that when men sincerely desire to receive the victory of Christ and to believe and obey the Lord, He will spontaneously direct their attention to these other external matters, and they will automatically obey...At this stage, if certain things are not clear to some, we would be most willing to help them in the Bible study meetings.
[145]  God has shown me that in every local church a group of overcomers should be raised up as those mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3 to be the Lord's witnesses.
[146]  In January 1934 he held his third overcomer conference in Shanghai.
[147]  The following excerpt is taken from his announcement of this conference.
[148]  The number of attendants at the third overcomer conference was about three hundred, with over one hundred from different provinces throughout the country.
[149]  During Watchman's silent years, he took the opportunity to purchase many houses on a mountain which was called Kuling, close to Foochow, where many missionaries had their summer retreat.
[150]  Following the training in October, the trainees returned to their respective places throughout China, taking with them the help they had received.
[151]  Its theme was specifically the deep things of God and was composed of messages on life with the Lord Jesus as the center, especially emphasizing His life, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His intercession, His Body, His coming back, and His kingdom.
[152]  We continue with a portion of his open letter from the twenty-fourth issue of The Christian, published in December 1927:
[153]  In the past years, day by day the hand of the Lord has become heavier upon me, forcing me to realize that He desires me to bear a special testimony for His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[154]  Therefore, I am ready to give up the work of expounding the Scriptures, which thing I would like to do most, in order that I might bear the specific testimony which God has freshly committed to me.
[155]  The following words are taken from the open letter in the nineteenth issue of The Present Testimony of January February 1931:
[156]  The announcement in the combined thirteenth and fourteenth issues concerning The Christian was as follows:
[157]  From the fifth issue of The Christian published in March 1926:
[158]  From now on, the Lord willing, each issue of The Christian will contain a column on "The Signs of the Times" that our readers might better understand the situation in the last days and know how the prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled step by step.
[159]  When we published our first issue of The Christian, we included a statement stating our goal, standard, and affiliation.
[160]  After twenty-four issues of The Christian had been published, Watchman was burdened to resume the publications of The Present Testimony.
[161]  The following statement was Watchman's announcement concerning his publications, issued in the June 1934 edition of Notes on Scriptural Messages:
[162]  In the winter of 1927, having become clear concerning God's will that I was especially called to bear testimony on the spiritual side of the truth which excludes everything that might cause dispute regarding prophecy, the church, and Bible interpretation , I discontinued The Christian and reissued The Present Testimony.
[163]  Meanwhile, I was continually expecting in my heart, and I frequently mentioned to the co-workers, that it would be best if God would raise up someone else to do this in-between work.
[164]  Last year during the time of my weakness, I received a special dealing from God and felt deeply at that time that if I continued in this way, I could not adequately accomplish the things God had committed to me.
[165]  The following announcement by Witness Lee appeared in the first issue of The Christian, newly published in July 1934:
[166]  Our hope is that God will use this little testimony to lead His children to draw near to His living Word, Christ, and to His written Word, the Bible.
[167]  In this way they will be able to see how to go on today and obey Christ that He might have a larger and fuller place in their lives and work.
[168]  It is our hope that they will also be helped to see the heavenly pattern Christ and turn their attention to His central work the church in order that Christ might be exalted and the Body of Christ, the church, be built up.
[169]  It is also our desire that God would use this paper to declare His will and release His truths that the spiritual life of His children could be nurtured and their problems resolved.
[170]  For fellowship between the churches and communication between the saints in different localities, Watchman was burdened at the end of 1933 to publish Collection of Newsletters.
[171]  After receiving a little light from God to see the Body of Christ, we feel deeply that for an individual to act alone is regrettable and that for an assembly to move independently is terrible.
[172]  If we are accurate in our perception, the greatest shortage among today's believers is that they do not know what the Body life is.
[173]  This paper continued for only two and a half years until July 1935.
[174]  A letter by Watchman Nee published in the twelfth issue of Collection of Newsletters, July 1935, tells us the reason for its being discontinued.
[175]  Because of the Japanese invasion in July 1937, many saints and co-workers in the Lord's recovery were forced to move to the interior of China from the coastal provinces.
[176]  Watchman was burdened to publish The Open Door, not as an official publication, but as part of his personal ministry to serve the scattered saints.
[177]  This paper, after its nineteenth issue in September 1939, was suspended until it was replaced by The Ministers in 1948.
[178]  3 The Ministers was to replace The Open Door.
[179]  The nature of The Ministers was to help the churches and the serving ones in the matter of knowing the way to serve and to solve the problems in the ministry.

[183]  His ministry, therefore, was focused on Christ's death and resurrection for the producing of the church in life to experience the victory of Christ that His kingdom might be ushered in. For this reason, he considered messages on these matters as the central messages.

[194]  Watchman Nee had a definite goal for his ministry.
[195]  Many Christians may say, "We have not established mission boards, humanistic societies, Sunday schools, schools, and hospitals."
[196]  In an open letter published in the twelfth issue of Collection of Newsletters, July 1935, Watchman stressed this goal again with the following brief, strong word: "We are clear that God wants us to manifest the life of Christ in the local churches.
[197]  Hence, the reality of our work is the life of Christ, and the outward expression of our work is the local churches."
[198]  Actually, however, it was not that he was wrong, it was that they did not see that the Lord had revealed to him God's desire to have Christ expressed in local churches.
[199]  Fairly speaking, at the time Watchman Nee was raised up by the Lord, among millions of Christians with all kinds of Christian work, where was there one proper church built up with Christ in oneness without any element of division?
[200]  Watchman's ministry also had the characteristic that it stirred up his listeners to seek the truth according to the Scriptures.
[201]  Before his ministry was raised up, not many Christians in China were interested in checking all truth with the Scriptures.
[202]  In conclusion, Brother Nee, as a unique gift of the age given by the Lord to His Body for His move of the recovery on the earth, should be considered as a seer of the divine visions in the present age according to what he had seen of the divine revelation.
[203]  The death of Christ: Its redeeming aspect, crucifying all the negative and old things.
[204]  Its life-releasing aspect, imparting the divine life into the believers.
[205]  The believers: As the tripartite men, with a spirit, soul, and body.
[206]  Regenerated with the divine life to be the sons of God.
[207]  But after I was saved under Sister Peace Wang's preaching that afternoon, while I was walking home, I stopped and prayed to God, according to Sister Wang's message, somewhat as follows: "God, I don't like being usurped by Satan as Pharaoh, through the world as Egypt; I would like to serve You and preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus through the villages at any cost for my whole life."
[208]  While I was seeking to know the Bible in a thorough way, there appeared in my hometown a Christian periodical entitled The Morning Star.
[209]  I obtained and read all available issues of that paper.
[210]  Brother Du and I then went to our former denomination and proposed that they invite Watchman Nee to come speak to them.
[211]  Just as I desired to spend my life preaching the gospel on the day I was saved, so after I graduated from college, the Lord reminded me of this same thing.
[212]  But I took the excuse that I had to help my younger brother finish his college education.
[213]  At that time I knew that my destiny was to give my life to serve the Lord.
[214]  The next morning both of the two leading ones came to me and told me that after praying they felt it was of the Lord that I should leave my occupation and give my full time to serving the Lord.
[215]  While in Shanghai in October 1933, Watchman received me as his guest.
[216]  I stayed with him for about four months, and during that time he did a number of things to perfect me.
[217]  Concerning some of these things, I was clear what he was doing, and concerning others I was not clear at the time.
[218]  I would not speak, for I realized that the more I spoke, the more foolish I was.
[219]  Third, he instructed me in matters concerning church history from the first century to the present.
[220]  He recounted all the main things which occurred concerning the church, and the way he did it was deeply significant.
[221]  I had been helped by the Brethren to know the Bible in the way of letters, but he helped me know the Bible in the way of life.
[222]  During that ten-day conference, I received much help from his messages.
[223]  They were indeed marvelous, marking a real turn in both my Christian life and in my church life.
[224]  At first I did not understand what he meant, but eventually I was helped to see that Acts reveals to us how Christ ascended to the heavens and was made both Lord and Christ 2:36 , whereas Colossians reveals that Christ should have the preeminence in all things and should be all and in all in God's economy 1:18; 3:11 .
[225]  While I was away in the north, Watchman conducted a series of meetings with the church in Shanghai in February 1934 following his conference.
[226]  When I opened the bundle, I was so happy to see that the articles were composed of the messages given by him in the Bible study meetings while I was away.
[227]  In the summer of 1934, Sister Ruth Lee visited the churches in Kwangtung province and Hong Kong.
[228]  Therefore, during this time I was charged to care for the editing of Collection of Newsletters.
[229]  ...Concerning the articles for Collection of Newsletters, I personally hope that in the future there will be more news about how the brothers and sisters have consecrated to the Lord, about how they have obeyed the Lord and have taken the Lord as Head over all things, about how they have overcome their dryness and entered into the more abundant life, and about how they were delivered from a sinful life and have overcome sin.
[230]  During this same period of time while traveling in the south, Sister Ruth Lee wrote Watchman and me a letter concerning the church.
[231]  Watchman asked me to publish it in issue ten of Collection of Newsletters with his comment as follows:
[232]  In the same summer, Watchman wrote Some Words from the Responsible Brothers and asked me to sign it with him and publish it in the tenth issue of Collection of Newsletters.
[233]  When he returned to Shanghai from Foochow, I was invited to visit the churches in Ping-Yang County of Chekiang province.
[234]  In October of that year, he went to Hangchow for the fourth overcomer conference and I traveled there from Ping-Yang to attend the conference.
[235]  At the end of May 1935, I returned to Chefoo.
[236]  I asked him to resume his ministry, but he told me that because of certain rebellious brothers, his ministering spirit would not allow him to minister to the church in Shanghai.
[237]  At the end of December 1947, Sister Peace Wang, Sister Rachel Lee, and I first visited the church in Hong Kong and then proceeded from there to visit the churches in Canton, Swatow, Amoy, and Foochow, Watchman's hometown.
[238]  During our three-week stay with the church in Foochow, a revival came in.
[239]  By 1948 the number of attendants in the church in Shanghai had greatly increased.
[240]  It was, therefore, necessary to build a larger meeting hall, and a piece of land was purchased for that purpose on Nan-Yang Road.
[241]  In November 1948, Brother Nee called an urgent conference of all the co-workers in Shanghai to pray, fellowship, and seek clear guidance concerning whether we should stay or leave China.
[242]  At that time I was in Hangchow holding a migration conference with the church there.
[243]  Because a revival was brought there through his ministry, he cabled me in Taiwan, asking me to meet him there before he returned to China.
[244]  I replied that I was in the midst of an important conference in Taipei and would not be able to arrive in Hong Kong before he left.
[245]  His response was that as soon as I was free I should go to Hong Kong, regardless of whether he was still there or not, to arrange the service of the church there.
[246]  The following is the testimony of Brother Hsu Jin-chin concerning one of the meetings:
[247]  In response to their handing themselves over to the work for the Lord's recovery, Brother Nee and I wrote the following reply to them:
[248]  The following are two more letters written by Brother Nee and me to another sister concerning the disposal of material possessions.
[249]  Before I went to meet Watchman in Hong Kong, while still in Taiwan, I finished the compiling and composing work on the second Chinese hymnal.
[250]  I presented him with the manuscript, and he polished the hymn on the life of the grapevine, adding a few stanzas to it.
[251]  At that time I related to him that I had also composed sixty lessons on the basic truths of the Scriptures and that there was the need to reprint the first Chinese hymnal and some others of his publications.
[252]  In spite of others' advice, one day in the middle of March, Brother Nee asked his brother-in-law, Samuel Chang, to send him to the railway station to depart for the mainland.
[253]  In my entire life I have never met another person who knew the Bible as deeply as Watchman Nee.
[254]  The revelations concerning Christ, the church, the spirit, and life which I saw through Watchman Nee, the infusions of life which I received from him, and the things concerning the work and the church which I learned from him will require eternity to evaluate their true worth.
