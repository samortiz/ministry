   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Natural Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of the influence of modern scientific studies, it is not difficult for us to understand what a natural law is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, we may speak of the law of digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The food we eat is digested according to this law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What do we mean by a natural law?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A natural law is an automatic, spontaneous action that is caused by a natural power or strength.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After we eat a meal, there is no need for us to work consciously at digesting the food, for a particular law in our body spontaneously works to cause the food to be digested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the law of digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the food we eat passes into our stomach, this law begins to work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the working of this law, our food is digested automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This law of digestion is an illustration of what Paul means by law in 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may also use fruit trees to illustrate the meaning of law in 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A peach tree produces peaches according to the natural law of a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, there is no reason to order a peach tree to bear peaches and not apples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one would be so foolish as to say to a peach tree, Peach tree, I would remind you that I want you to produce peaches and not apples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must produce peaches for me this year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A peach tree will automatically produce peaches according to the natural law of a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The peach-tree law will also determine the shape of the peaches produced by a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The peaches will all be somewhat round in shape and not cubical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you ever seen a peach tree that bore peaches with the shape of a cube?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A peach tree would never produce fruit with such a shape, because that would be contrary to the law of a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the peach-tree law shapes the fruit into a certain form, there is no need for us to say, Peach tree, do not produce fruit in the form of a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want all the fruit you produce to be round.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To help you, I will place a model in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now I want you to shape all the peaches into a round form like this model.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How ridiculous it would be for anyone to give such instructions to a peach tree!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fruit produced by a peach tree is shaped according to the natural law of the peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A peach tree automatically will produce fruit that is round and not cubical.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With every kind of living thing, whether plant or animal, there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that wherever there is a certain life, there will be a certain law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, the life is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, a dog has the natural law of the dog life, and a cat has the law of the cat life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The principle is the same with human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in the natural life of a human being there is the law of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Highest Life</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord that through regeneration we have received the highest life!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life is eternal life, the divine, uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This life is nothing less than the very life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we have been born of God, we have received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah for the divine birth that gives us the divine life!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As those who believe in Christ, we all have had two births: the human birth and the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we were born of our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then at the time of our conversion, we believed in the Lord Jesus and had another birth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 1:12 and 13 say, But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These verses tell us clearly that we have been born of God to be children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In his first Epistle John also refers a number of times to the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, in 1 John 3:9 he says, Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1 John 4:7 he says, Everyone who loves has been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then in chapter five of his Epistle John says, Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God v. 1 ; Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world v. 4 ; and Everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, but he who is begotten of God keeps himself v. 18 . From these verses we can see clearly that we who believe in Christ have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have experienced the divine birth, and through this divine birth we have received the divine life, the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We know that animal life is higher than plant life and that human life is higher than animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we need to see that the divine life is higher than human life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the divine life is the highest life, its law is the highest and most prevailing law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise the Lord that the highest life with the highest law is within us!</S>
