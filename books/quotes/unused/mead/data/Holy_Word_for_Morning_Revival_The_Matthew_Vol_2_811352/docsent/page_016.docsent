   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>14 And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16 But to what shall I liken this generation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to the others</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>17 And say, We have 1 played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have 1 sung a dirge, and you did not mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>18 For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet wisdom is justified by her works.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>20 Then He began to reproach the cities because they did not repent:</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's appraising His forerunner continues in verses 13 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 13 says, "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that the Old Testament dispensation was terminated by the coming of John.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 14 says, "And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Malachi 4:5 prophesied that Elijah would come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah Luke 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, in a sense, John may be considered "Elijah, who is to come" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matt 17:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the prophecy of Malachi 4:5 will actually be fulfilled during the great tribulation, when the real Elijah, one of the two witnesses, will come to strengthen God's people Rev 11:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the Lord appraised John, He turned to the rejecting generation and reproached them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His appraisal reminded them that John had been rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter how great John was, he was nonetheless in prison due to the rejection of that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 18 and 19 reveal that John, coming to bring men to repentance Mark 1:4 and to cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating and drinking Luke 1:15-17 ; whereas Christ, coming to bring salvation to sinners and to cause them to rejoice in it, had the joy of eating and drinking with them Matt 9:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom people, who are under no regulation, follow the divine wisdom, concentrating on the indwelling Christ, who is their wisdom 1 Cor 1:30 , not on the outward manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 19 the Lord said, "Yet wisdom is justified by her works."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wisdom is Christ 1 Cor 1:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This wisdom was justified, vindicated, by His wise works, His wise deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this verse some authorities read "children" instead of "works."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom people are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is justified by the kingdom people, who know when to eat and when not to eat and who recognize the playing of the flute and the singing of the dirge, knowing when to rejoice and when to repent.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>17 1 Christ and John the Baptist "played the flute" to preach the gospel of the kingdom, but the Jewish religionists did not "dance" for the joy of salvation; John and Christ "sang a dirge" to preach repentance, but the Jewish religionists did not mourn for the grief of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The righteousness of God demanded that they repent, but they would not obey; the grace of God afforded them salvation, but they would not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>23 1 Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament Gen 37:35; Psa 6:5 , is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept Luke 16:22-23; Acts 2:27 .</S>
