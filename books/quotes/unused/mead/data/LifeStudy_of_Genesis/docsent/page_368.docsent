   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a To Reach the Chosen Bride</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Abraham commissioned his servant to reach the chosen bride vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>10-21 , so God the Father commissioned God the Spirit to reach the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all can testify that at a certain time the Spirit of God came to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you would say, "I didn't realize that God the Spirit came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I only know that someone preached the gospel to me."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As that person was preaching the gospel to you, you were attracted by what he said and were willing to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although you did not understand everything he was saying, something deep within you was responding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our mentality, many of us said, "I don't like this," but deep within our spirit we said, "This is very good."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In my early ministry in China I did a great deal of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the learned Chinese, who thought of Christianity as a foreign religion, heard our preaching, they said in their mentality, "This is a foreign religion; I don't like it."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But, as many of them later testified, while they were saying this, something deep within them said, "This is what I need."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What was it that caused them to respond in this way deep within?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was the Holy Spirit reaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rebekah never dreamed that she would be selected to be Isaac's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the custom of the time, she simply went to draw water late in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But on this day something special happened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before she came to the well, Abraham's servant was already there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates the Spirit's coming to the human race v. 10 . Before we ever heard the preaching of the gospel or came to a gospel meeting, the Holy Spirit was already there waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Genesis 24, Abraham's servant, who had come to a well v. 11 , asked a woman to give him a drink of water v. 17 . In John 4, the Lord Jesus, who had come to Jacob's well John 4:6 , also asked a woman for a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Preachers often say that we are thirsty and need the living water to quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But have you ever heard that the Holy Spirit is thirsty and needs you to quench His thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 24 we see a servant who was thirsty after his long journey, and in John 4 we see a Savior who was thirsty after His tiring journey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who was more thirsty in Genesis 24, the servant or Rebekah?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The servant was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, who was more thirsty in John 4, the Lord Jesus or the Samaritan woman?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, as we preach the gospel, we must tell people that the Father, Son, and Spirit are thirsty for them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rebekah did not have the sense that she was thirsty; neither did she feel the need for a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was the servant who was thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the time he had reached the city of Nahor, he was thirsty both physically and spiritually, thirsting for the woman who would be the proper wife for his master's son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 4, the Lord Jesus also was thirsty both physically and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As you are reading this message, the Holy Spirit is even now thirsty for you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Will you give Him a drink and quench His thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we heard the preaching of the gospel in the past, we did not realize that the Holy Spirit was thirsty for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We might have thought, "Why is this preacher so ambitious to convince me?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But that was not the ambition of the preacher; it was the thirst of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As you were listening to the preaching of the gospel, did you not sense that someone was desirous of having you?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time you were saved, you felt that someone was chasing you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, you said, "I don't like this"; on the other hand, something deep within you said, "You cannot run away."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As Rebekah went to draw water from the well that day, she was completely innocent, having no idea of what was to happen to her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She did not realize that by giving a man a drink of water and by drawing water for his camels she would be caught.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the father far away had made a plan to take a woman from her race as the wife for his son and had commissioned his servant to carry out this plan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the servant came to the city of Nahor and purposely waited there by the well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was a real hunter hunting for a wife for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If Rebekah had never spoken to the servant, she would not have been caught.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But, as we have seen, what happened did not depend on her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The servant had already prayed that the Lord would give him success, saying, "Let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master" v. 14 . While he was still speaking in this way, Rebekah came.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When he asked her for a drink of water, she not only gave him a drink, but said, "I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although Rebekah did not realize it, in doing this, she was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many of us can testify that, at the beginning, we did not think well of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But at a certain time something deep within began to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I was a youth, I did not understand very much about Christ, but I did love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although I could not explain it then, I simply began to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But now I know the reason: in eternity, the Father had planned to catch me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although I am just a little man, I am more than worthy of being caught by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all have been caught by Him according to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let me ask you, did you desire to be saved or to be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>None of us did.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But one day we heard the name of Jesus and responded to it in love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the sign that we have been chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who brought the servant to the city of Nahor where Rebekah dwelt?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And who brought Rebekah to the well where the servant was waiting?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Undoubtedly, it was the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our being saved did not depend on us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was the result of the Father's plan and the Spirit's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Abraham's servant eventually reached Rebekah through the satisfying water v. 14 . God's chosen ones are the satisfying water to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today the Holy Spirit comes to seek God's chosen ones as Christ did at the well of Sychar John 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If anyone responds to Him and satisfies His desire, this is a sign that he is one of those chosen for Christ and that he will be gained by the Holy Spirit for Christ.</S>
