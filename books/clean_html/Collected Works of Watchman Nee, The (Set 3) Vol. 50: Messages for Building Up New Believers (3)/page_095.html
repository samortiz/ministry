<h2 class="head3">6. The Woman Beginning to Teach</h2><p>Matthew 13:33 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal." This woman is Roman Catholicism, the degraded church. She began to exercise her self-assumed authority. Many sisters cannot understand why the Bible forbids a woman to teach. This is because the Bible forbids the church to teach. In typology the church has no authority to teach. The principle of forbidding the woman to teach shows us that the church has no authority to teach. Here the woman began to put leaven into the meal. This means that the woman began to exercise her authority. In other words, the church began to teach.</p><p>The Roman Catholic Church tells men that the Bible is God's Word, yet it also says that the church can speak for God. Of course, the church that it refers to is the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has become very powerful and has brought many things into the church. If you argue that the Bible does not say anything about the practices of the church, the Roman Catholic Church will tell you that it decides the way things should be. If you say that there are no idols according to the Bible, it will say that the pope has sanctioned the idols. You may say that there is no such thing as the worship of Mary in the Bible, but it will say that the church believes that Mary should be worshipped. The woman has assumed the role of teacher.</p><p>Thyatira, which in God's eyes is Roman Catholicism, tolerates Jezebel, a prophetess. This woman brought adultery into the church, and she brought idolatry into the church. The symbol of the woman means that the church rather than the Lord is now making all the decisions. It is Jezebel, the prophetess, who is teaching, not the Lord. It would have been better for the church if it had received its teaching from the Head instead of assuming the role of teacher for itself. When the church assumes this role, it results in all kinds of heresies being introduced into the church. This is what the Lord means when He says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Leaven in Three Measures of Meal</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Leaven Being Wrong Doctrines,<br />Which Are Easy to Take</h2><p>Leaven refers to wrong doctrines. The Lord Jesus spoke about the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees. In Mark 8:15 there was the leaven of Herod. Thus, leaven in the Bible refers to wrong doctrines. It is quite clear that the fine flour in Leviticus 2:1 refers to the food of God's people. In particular it refers to the Lord Jesus. The Word of God shows us that the Lord Jesus is the fine flour, which is the food God gave to His people. Leaven is not allowed in this food. God commanded the people of Israel to eat unleavened bread when they came out of Egypt. In other words, putting leaven into fine flour spoils the Lord Jesus as our food! Originally, there was fine flour, but now leaven has been added to it.</p><p>What happens when leaven is added to fine flour? Without leaven, bread is coarse, tasteless, hard, heavy, and difficult to digest. With leaven, bread becomes light and easy to digest. Leaven makes the flour tasty and easy to digest. Many people feel that it is too hard to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings; they find it hard to digest these things. Those who study the types of the Old Testament know clearly that fine flour refers to the life of the Lord Jesus. Some feel that such a life is too weighty, hard, and solid; they cannot take it. The woman in the parable introduces many heresies into the church. She leavens the fine flour, making it easier for many to accept the Lord! When the world and every kind of heresy and doctrine are brought into the church, it is easier for someone to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings! This is what Roman Catholicism has done.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Heresy of Confusion</h2><p>According to the truth concerning the church, the works mentioned above constitute a great mixture. The world is mixed with the church, grace is mixed with the law, and believers are mixed with unbelievers. The result is confusion. Moreover, righteousness is mixed with mercy, paganism with Christianity, and religion with politics. There is no greater confusion and fornication than that which is seen in Roman Catholicism! It mixes Christianity with Judaism and Grecian art with the worship of God. It brings in every conceivable thing from the world! The birds of heaven have come in. Leaven has been put into the meal, and it has become leavened. Now it is light and puffy, and everyone can accept it. A person can be a Catholic as long as he is baptized. If he sins, he can buy an indulgence, which will deliver him from the sins of this life as well as the future purgatory.</p><p>All kinds of heresies have come in! As a result, the meal is now leavened, and men can easily accept it. Roman Catholicism does not ask men to take the leaven; it only asks men to take the fine flour which contains the leaven. Roman Catholicism gives us heresies as well as truths. It believes that Christ is the Son of God and that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish redemption. These two basic tenets of faith are there, but the fine flour has been leavened.</p>
