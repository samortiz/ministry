   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR HAVING THE SAME MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND WALKING BY THE SAME RULE Scripture Reading: Phil 3:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall be concerned mainly with 3:15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 15 Paul says, Let us therefore, as many as are full grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered full grown means mature, perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Maturity is a matter of stages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may be mature, but not mature in full.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 15 Paul uses the expression full grown in a relative sense, meaning relatively mature, neither childish nor absolutely mature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, further pursuing, further growth, is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are full grown still need a mind to pursue Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was full grown.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, he was still growing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This confirms that even the matter of full growth, or maturity, may be relative.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today none of us can say that we have reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we may not be childish and may actually be somewhat full grown, we still have not reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THIS MIND</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to verse 15, as many as are full grown should have this mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This book s dealing with the Philippian believers is focused on the mind, the leading part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It charges them to strive together for the gospel with one soul 1:27 , to think the same thing, to be joined in soul, even to think the one thing 2:2; 4:2 , to let the mind which was in Christ be in them 2:5 , and to have this mind, a mind focused on the pursuing and gaining of Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our mind is thus occupied, we have the same mind, thinking the same thing, even thinking the one thing the fullest gain of Christ joined in soul, like-souled 2:20 , and with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul s word in verse 15 implies that if we do not have this mind, we may be childish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not having this mind is a sign that we are not full grown.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we consider the situation among Christians today, we see a great deal of childishness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not many believers have this mind, the mind to seek after the fullest enjoyment and gain of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Imagine how marvelous the situation would be if all seeking Christians had a mind focused on pursuing Christ for the full enjoyment and gaining of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the seeking Christians were like this, the situation on earth would be excellent and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the situation among Christians today is confused and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is due to the fact that seeking Christians do not have this mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of seeking God s unique goal, they pursue other goals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These different goals cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We in the Lord s recovery should have one goal, and this goal should be to pursue Christ that we may have the fullest enjoyment of Him and may gain Him in full.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD S UNIQUE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 3:15 Paul says that if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Pursuing after Christ must be our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be otherwise minded.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God wants always to adjust our mind to His center by revealing to us the need of such a mind, a mind focused on the pursuing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul s word in verse 15 indicates his assurance that there was just one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of this assurance he could say that if in anything we were otherwise minded, this also God would reveal to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul did not mean that Christians did not have other goals.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What he said was that God would reveal this to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to see God s unique goal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We thank the Lord that throughout the years God s goal has kept us from being distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very easy to be distracted in the Christian life, for there are many distracting factors surrounding us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not have a fixed goal, the unique goal, the goal set up by God in eternity, and hold to it, we shall eventually be distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only thing that can keep us on God s way is His unique goal Christ for our highest enjoyment and ultimate gain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we take this goal as our ultimate goal, we shall be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>ONLY THIS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 3:16 Paul goes on to say, Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is rather difficult to translate the Greek word rendered only this in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may also be rendered but rather, nevertheless, or however.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a concluding word to the preceding verses, charging us with only this: to walk by the same rule.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The words whereunto we have attained modify walk.</S>
