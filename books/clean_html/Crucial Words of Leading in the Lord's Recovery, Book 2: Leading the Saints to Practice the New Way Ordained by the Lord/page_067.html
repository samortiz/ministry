<h2 class="head3">The Thummim Being an Object Engraved<br />
with the Remaining Four Letters<br />
and Added to the Breastplate</h2>
<p>Because there were four letters missing from the breastplate, another object&mdash;the Thummim&mdash;was added. The word <em>Thummim</em> means &ldquo;perfecters, or completers.&rdquo; Without this object, the Hebrew alphabet on the breastplate of the high priest would have been short of four letters and would not have been complete. When the Thummim was added, four letters were added, and thus the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet were present.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Urim Being an Illuminator<br />
Inserted into the Breastplate</h2>
<p>Moreover, there was the need to add another object&mdash;the Urim. <em>Urim</em> means &ldquo;lights, or illuminators.&rdquo;</p>

according to the Shining of the Engraved Letters</h2>
<p>Every time the high priest went into the presence of God, there were two kinds of plates on him: one was the shoulder plates, representing strength, for bearing God&rsquo;s people, and the other was the breastplate, which implies caring in love. The Lord cares for us by holding us in His bosom and supplies us with power by bearing us on His shoulders. Today the elders should also hold the saints in their &ldquo;bosom&rdquo; and bear them on their &ldquo;shoulders.&rdquo; The bosom&rsquo;s holding is an expression of love, and the shoulders&rsquo; bearing is a supply of power. Every time the elders draw near to God, they need to wear these two kinds of plates; that is, they need to bear the saints upon themselves as they come into the presence of God. The elders&rsquo; receiving of God&rsquo;s revelation reflects the receiving of revelation through the letters on the breastplate.</p>
<p>Many years ago I read an article concerning the Urim and the Thummim written by a Hebrew scholar. The author of this article said that in Joshua 7 Achan&rsquo;s sin was probably discovered through the Urim and the Thummim. He stated that when the high priest came to seek God, he was able to put words and sentences together through the illumination of the letters on the breastplate. Thus, through the Urim and the Thummim the high priest discovered that the one who sinned belonged to the tribe of Judah; then he identified the household and finally the person. The principle related to the use of the Urim and the Thummim is that the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is not through human government. Instead, it is a divine government, a theocracy, not a democracy or an autocracy. The elders must submit to God&rsquo;s authority and seek God&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>How does God lead the elders? First, He speaks through the Bible; second, through the Holy Spirit; and third, through the saints as an alphabet. When the elders come before God, they must bear the brothers and sisters on their shoulders and hold them in their bosom. As they bear the saints in God&rsquo;s presence, God enlightens and enables them to read the condition of the saints. The longer the elders stay before God, the more they will understand God&rsquo;s intention. This is an excellent type in the Old Testament, and when it is realized in the New Testament, it preserves the principle of God&rsquo;s government.</p>

and Seek God&rsquo;s Instruction</h2>
<p>There are three means by which the elders administrate the church: the Bible, the Holy Spirit, and the saints as an alphabet. Our experience confirms these points. When the elders take care of God&rsquo;s children, they need to seek God&rsquo;s guidance; they need not only the Bible and the Holy Spirit but also the brothers and sisters as the alphabet. This means that they need to bear the brothers and sisters before God and read the condition of every brother and sister before God. In this way the elders will know what God wants them to do and what God&rsquo;s present will is in the church life.</p>
