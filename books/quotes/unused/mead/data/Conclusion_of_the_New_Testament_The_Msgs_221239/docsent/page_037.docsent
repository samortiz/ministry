   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Participate in the Joy of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus twice says, "Enter into the joy of your lord" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>21b, 23b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"The joy of your lord" signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, that will be the time for Him to enjoy the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan will be bound, Christ will recover the earth, and the entire earth will be under His reign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By repossessing the earth, the Lord will have His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He will invite His followers, His partners, to participate in this enjoyment, to enter into His joy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The overcomers will be crowned, sit with Christ on His throne, have authority over the nations and shepherd them, and also participate in the joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, they will be seated with Christ on His throne to have authority over the nations; on the other hand, they will enter into the joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Entering into the Lord's joy is greater than being crowned and having authority over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The joy of the Lord will be the greatest thing in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>K. To Inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God to Enter the Manifestation of the Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Ephesians 5:5b Paul speaks of a believer's "inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingdom of Christ is the millennium Rev 20:4, 6; Matt 16:28 ; it is also the kingdom of God Matt 13:41, 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God John 3:5 and in the church life they are living in the kingdom of God today Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcoming believers will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The defeated believers will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The term "the kingdom of Christ and of God" refers not to the kingdom today in the church life but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only in the millennium will the kingdom of Christ also become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today all believers are in the kingdom of God but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both the defeated ones and the overcoming ones may be in the church as the kingdom of God, but only the overcomers will inherit the kingdom during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 6:10b Paul speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "inherit" here implies enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To inherit a certain thing is to enjoy that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, to inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This should be an incentive for us to live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By living an overcoming life today we shall be qualified to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</S>
