<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE UNVEILED TRUTH OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION FOR THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:45b</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we have been caught by Your mercy and grace to be Your seekers pursuing You according to what the Scripture reveals to us. Lord, save us, rescue us, and deliver us from our natural concept, from any kind of philosophical idea, and even the more from the blinding, the covering, the veil, we have received from the teachings of today's Christianity. This morning we are here looking unto You for Your mercy to take the veils, layer by layer, away from us. Lord, bring us into the intrinsic revelation of Your holy Word. We do not want to skate on the surface of the ice any longer. We want to get into the depths of Your revelation so that we may see all the intrinsic significances of Your heart unveiled in Your holy Word. O Lord, be merciful to us. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE LAYERS OF VEILS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING<br>OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</H2><P>Before we come to the third and fourth outlines for this conference, I have a deep feeling that I need to fellowship with you intimately concerning the understanding of the holy Scriptures.</P><P>According to my experience and observations, nearly all of us Christians today understand the Bible according to three things. The first thing is our natural concept. God has created us as very thoughtful people. We all have a wonderful mind. Out from this wonderful mind, we all have our natural concept. The first time you read the Bible, you understood it according to your natural concept. You imagined that was what the Bible meant, but actually it was not. That was what you understood according to your natural concept.</P><P>The second thing according to which people understand the Bible is their human philosophy. Human history has produced many philosophies. The Chinese, the Greeks, the Jews, the Arabs, the Indians from India, and the Japanese all have their particular philosophies. The Americans are the most modern people, and they have their kind of modern American philosophy. England, Germany, and France are close geographically, but the difference is great among their particular philosophies. It is very difficult for anyone to understand the Bible without unconsciously being under a philosophy.</P><P>The third thing that affects our understanding of the Bible is the teaching of today's Christianity. I am not referring to the heretical teachings, but to the fundamental, scriptural, right teachings. I was under that kind of teaching for years. Even today, I still say there was nothing wrong with that teaching, but the understanding from that kind of fundamental teaching covered me, veiled me, from seeing the intrinsic significances of the Bible.</P><P>Through the years, by the Lord's mercy, we have been rescued from these three layers of veils. When I come to the Word of God today, my realization is absolutely different from my realization sixty years ago. This is because sixty years ago I understood the holy Word according to the fundamental teachings I heard from the Brethren. But through many years, the Lord has been merciful to me. Gradually, year by year, through over sixty years, the Lord has brought me to a state of understanding and interpreting His Word according to the leading of the Holy Spirit to see the intrinsic significances of all the verses concerning the items of God's eternal economy.</P>
