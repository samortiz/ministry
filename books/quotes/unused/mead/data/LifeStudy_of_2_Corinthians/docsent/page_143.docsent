   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIGHTING TO SUBDUE REBELLIOUS THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter eleven of 2 Corinthians, Paul had to deal with the situation in a church that had been directly raised up by him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certain false apostles, deceitful workers, ministers of Satan, visited the church in Corinth and stirred up rebellion against Paul and his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though Paul had come to Corinth first and had brought many Corinthians to the Lord through his preaching, the Corinthian believers still accepted the false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts 16 records how Paul came to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was preaching in Asia Minor, in a region God had measured out to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At a certain time, Paul felt deep within that he should continue his preaching elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, he did not know what to do or where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may have thought that he should not go into Europe, but should remain in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then he had a dream of a Macedonian saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us Acts 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After considering that dream, Paul concluded that God was calling him to minister in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, he preached the gospel in Philippi, Thessalonica, Athens, and Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result of this preaching, a church was raised up in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometime afterward, the Judaizers came to Corinth and caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is hard to believe that the saints at Corinth would accept the teaching of the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, it is a fact that at least a number of the Corinthians accepted these teachings and were either stirred up or at least influenced by them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those teachings caused some to doubt Paul s apostleship and to oppose him and his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have seen that Paul had helped the Corinthians to solve a number of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the problem concerning the relationship between the believers at Corinth and the Apostle Paul still needed to be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, not all the Corinthians had a problem with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only some of them had a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But even this made it necessary for Paul to devote four chapters to dealing with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that Paul is strong in chapter ten and even stronger in chapter eleven, where he speaks of false apostles, deceitful workers, ministers of Satan, and super-apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you were a believer at Corinth who had accepted the teaching of the Judaizers, would you have taken Paul s word concerning false apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not very likely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the reason Paul was fighting to subdue the rebellious thoughts among the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PAUL S WAY OF FIGHTING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us now go on to see Paul s way of fighting the battle against Judaistic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 11:1 he says, I would that you bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed, you do bear with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The use of the word foolishness is an ironic reference to the apostle s enforced self-vindication and boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, Please bear with me in a little foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In all the foregoing, I have been wise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now I intend to speak in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before I do this, I ask that you bear with me in a little foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I shall not boast or speak foolishly without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There will be a limit to what I intend to say.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 2 Paul continues, For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This jealousy can be compared to the jealousy of a husband over his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word virgin in this verse means to be the bride for the Bridegroom John 3:29 , the wife of the Lamb Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the sounding out of the word recorded in verse 2, Satan is defeated, and all the Judaizers are put down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether in Paul s time or in ours, the Judaizers never minister anything to us that causes us to treasure the Lord Jesus as the One who is dear and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, what is ministered by the Judaizers stirs up our zeal for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Judaizers today may say something like this, This teaching is heretical and destroys our religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is contrary to the tradition we inherited from our fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Judaizers throughout the generations and the centuries have sought to protect their religion and to hold on to traditional doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Judaizers who came to Corinth may have said, Yes, we should believe in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But how can we forsake the law given through Moses by God?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This man Paul is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has destroyed the law, and he is against circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means the end of our religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Was God wrong in giving the law?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Were Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Elijah, and all the other prophets wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is Paul the only one who is right?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul, who came to you as an apostle, must be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the way the Judaizers spoke in Paul s time, and this is the way they talk today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who oppose the Lord s recovery often say something like this: Do you think that everyone and everything is wrong except you?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are your teachings the only teachings that are correct?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We shall rise up against the local church and defeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This thing must be terminated.</S>
