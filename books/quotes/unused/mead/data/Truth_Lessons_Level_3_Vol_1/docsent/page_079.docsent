   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that the Spirit of God, signified by the olive oil, became the compound Spirit, signified by the holy anointing ointment, through the process of Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before Jesus death and resurrection, the compound Spirit was not yet; it was after Christ s glorification at His resurrection that the compound Spirit was consummated John 7:39 .</S>
