   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY REPORT ON THE WORK 1 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:7:00 p.m., Saturday, May 1, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>PUTTING THE JERUSALEM PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>INTO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a little too early for the co-workers to take the way of Antioch today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle of Antioch that we practiced before begins from Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In practice, we have omitted chapters one to twelve; we have skipped the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man thinks that the work of spreading the gospel from Jerusalem through Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth is done by the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God's word says that the apostles remained in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jerusalem was the place where Peter worked, and Samaria was the place where Philip worked.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Philip reached Samaria, he gained the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord did say that the gospel is to be preached to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But He did not say that the same group of people will be doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who went to Samaria were one group, and those who go to the uttermost part of the earth are another group.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the apostles gained men in Jerusalem, they sent them out to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From Samaria, the gospel passes through other hands until it reaches the uttermost part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the past, we were too early in putting into practice the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now is not the time to practice the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now is the time to practice the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we cannot say that we are absolutely clear today, when the few responsible brothers came together, we felt that we should begin our work from the coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From now until August can be considered as one phase of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During this phase, all the workers in the whole nation will consolidate in Foochow and Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Witness Lee will take up the responsibility in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Keh-san will take up the responsibility in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, we need to have training meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After August, the work will concentrate on three areas: Tientsin, Tsingtao, and Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will leave Hong Kong, Swatow, and Peking alone for the time being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will initially establish a firm footing in the first three places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Tientsin is linked to Manchuria on the one hand, and to the Northwest on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Tsingtao will be particularly important to the Chiao-chi railway line.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, the largest number of believers are in Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Next to it is Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From Tsingtao, we can gain the whole province of Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We hope to commit the whole area to the brothers in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The responsibility of the brothers in Shanghai is toward the west, in cities like Hankow and Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The direction in Fukien is also toward the west.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the same time, Fukien should take care of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work in the provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi should begin from Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the future, when Southeast Asia rises up, Hong Kong should also have a start.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At present we cannot see that far.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The gospel work is done in portions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The relay race is a very good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One man takes one portion, and the next man takes another portion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is like the students of Chiao-tung University who ran from Nanking to Shanghai; every one of them ran a portion of the whole journey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We admit that the principle of Antioch is still very necessary in the future, but the way we should take at present is the way of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The work is developed through the fruit gained in Jerusalem, and not through the going out of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every believer should have his living centered on the gospel, and his work, occupation, dwelling, and livelihood should all be for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church should continually send out more people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we finish the building of the meeting hall, in a month or so, it will not be difficult to see the number double.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is even possible to triple or quadruple our number in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our failure during the past years has been due to the absence of the vision of the Jerusalem principle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From 1937 we have been practicing the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But it is not until today, in 1948, that we begin to go back to the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
