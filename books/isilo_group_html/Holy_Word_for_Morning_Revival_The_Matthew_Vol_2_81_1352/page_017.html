The main point in this chapter is how we should face rejection.</p><p>Verse 25 opens with the words, &#8220;At that time.&#8221; This refers to the time the Lord was rebuking the cities. Verse 25 says, &#8220;At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth.&#8221; When the Lord was rebuking those leading cities, He answered and said, &#8220;I extol You, Father.&#8221; The word &#8220;answered&#8221; is very meaningful. Whom did the Lord answer? He answered the Father. While the Lord was rebuking the cities, He fellowshipped with the Father.</p><p>As the Lord was rebuking the cities, a third party was present. The Lord was the first party, the cities were the second party, and the Father, who was with Him, was the third party. As the Lord was rebuking Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, the Father might have...said to the Son, &#8220;You are rebuking these cities because they have rejected You. Do You feel good about this?&#8221; The Lord immediately answered and extolled the Father, the Lord of heaven and of earth....The Greek word rendered &#8220;extol&#8221; in verse 25 means to acknowledge with extolment. The Lord acknowledged with extolment the Father&#8217;s way in carrying out His economy. Although people, instead of responding to His ministry, slandered Him (vv. 16-19), and the leading cities rejected Him (vv. 20-24), He extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father&#8217;s will. He did not seek prosperity in His work but sought the Father&#8217;s will; His satisfaction and rest were not in being understood and welcomed by man but in being known by the Father (vv. 26-27). Christ believed that the cities&#8217; rejection of Him was of the Father. What about our situation today? When we are rejected, opposed, criticized, attacked, and condemned, could we extol the Father?</p><p>In the Lord&#8217;s extolling address, &#8220;Father&#8221; refers to the Father&#8217;s relationship with Him, the Son, whereas &#8220;Lord of heaven and of earth&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s relationship with the universe. When God&#8217;s people were defeated by His enemy, God was called &#8220;the God of heaven&#8221; (Ezra 5:11-12; Dan. 2:18, 37). But when there was a man standing for Him on the earth, God was called &#8220;the Possessor of heaven and earth&#8221; (Gen. 14:19, 22).</p><p>In verse 28 the Lord [called all the toiling and burdened people to Himself to receive rest]. What a gracious word!...In verses 29 and 30 we have the way to rest....To take the Lord&#8217;s yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father&#8217;s will (26:39, 42)....In verse 29 the Lord tells us to learn from Him. He is meek and lowly in heart. To be meek, or gentle, means not to resist any opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly. Throughout all the opposition the Lord was meek, and throughout all the rejection He was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself.
