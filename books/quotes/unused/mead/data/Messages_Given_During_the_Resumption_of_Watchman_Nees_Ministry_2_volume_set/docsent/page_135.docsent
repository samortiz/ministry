   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Taking the Corporate Leading</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Wiser Than Taking Individual Leadings</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God's work, we have to learn to accept the corporate leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not saying that there are no more individual leadings of the Lord, nor am I saying that corporate leadings today can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for corporate leadings to always be right; there are times when they can be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we can ask ourselves: Do we have leadings in our individual works, and have we ever made any mistakes in those leadings?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is possible for individual leadings to be wrong, and it is equally possible for corporate leadings to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But proportionally speaking, the decision of ten men ahead of me is surely better than my own decision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to learn to be a receiving vessel before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should accept the judgment of the brothers ahead of us and should take their judgments as our own judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should take others' judgments and should be able to have others take our judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you know that a young one has done something that you know is wrong, and if through the lack of learning the proper lesson, you dare not speak to him, you are allowing him to perpetuate his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I want to go to Taiwan today, and eight or ten brothers say that I should go to Tsingtao, I should submit to their judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes an individual may feel very strongly and convincingly about something, and the feeling may differ from that of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, though feelings may differ, the spirit must not differ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am here to do God's will, and you are also here to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When everyone is here to do God's will, there will not be a difference in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you complain or are angry, your spirit is wrong, and your emotions are also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you say, "Why not ask me to go to other places?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why, of all places, should I go to Tsingtao?" your spirit is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you say that you are going to be a preacher and your father insists that you apply for a job in the Customs Department, you cannot argue with him or lose your temper by breaking dishes and cups around the house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although you cannot take his suggestion, you still have to say to him, "Father, I would very much like to take your advice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I cannot obey you, because there is no way that I can be the same as you are."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our spirit is wrong, the result would not be pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only does our spirit have to be the same, it has to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church, those brothers who are in authority should learn to pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The basic principle of service in the church is the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible there is no such thing as the minority going along with the majority; there is only the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One can gather a few dozen saints to fellowship and pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If in the church a group of people would fast and pray together, they would surely speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is all right for a person to have some feelings of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if he does not have absolute confidence that what he has is of the Lord, it is better for him to submit to the others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Leading in the Body Cutting Short</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>an Individual's Journey</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a strong relationship between a person's spiritual journey and the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why is there the need of the leading of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is because with the leading of the Body one can somewhat cut short an individual's spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a brother is left to himself, he may have to stumble for ten years before he can come up with something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But now through the Body he may acquire the same thing in one evening.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If such a brother will take the judgment of the Body, he will save a lot of time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The use of authority in the church is for the purpose of cutting down mistakes and shortening the journeys.</S>
