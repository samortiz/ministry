   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ELDERS 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 8:4-5, 26-27; Eph 2:5; John 3:3, 5-6; Gal 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the spiritual responsibility of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FULFILLING THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spiritual responsibility of the elders is primarily the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament presents this truth in a very deep, hidden, and significant way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In its highest light concerning the gospel, the New Testament shows that the preaching of the glad tidings is the fulfillment of the New Testament priesthood Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 15:16 Paul said, "That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The noun priest in Greek means a laboring, struggling, energizing priest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should be the New Testament priests not merely in position or name but in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should struggle and be very energetic because we know that Satan's goal is to frustrate the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the entire universe and especially on the earth, there is a struggle between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God wants to spread His Son, Christ, as the good news, but Satan hates the spread of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we are warring against Satan for the cause of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we must offer living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament, the priests offered sacrifices from the herd, the flock, and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the offerings in the Old Testament were types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In type, the sacrifice offered to God by the Old Testament priests was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today the offering of the individual Christ has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is now time for the offering of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the New Testament priests, we should offer the members of Christ to God.</S>
