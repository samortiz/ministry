   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 5 Date: August 19, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: What is the reminding of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: We can only remember what we have encountered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Remembering means thinking of something a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reminding of the Holy Spirit is when the Holy Spirit reveals to us a second time what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every time the Holy Spirit reveals something to us, He presents a picture before us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reminding of the Holy Spirit unveils this picture before us a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It reminds us not only of words spoken, but it gives us a revisitation, a fresh revelation of what we once saw.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reminding of the Holy Spirit preserves the freshness of past revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, there are two ways to remember the Lord at His table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One is through personal revelation, and the other is through the reminding of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first case, a man realizes that the Lord is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the second case, a man sees the very picture of the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we break the bread, we must not only recognize the Lord as the Savior, but also we must have a fresh vision of the picture of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of bread-breaking will give us a strong and powerful impression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same can be said of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There must be a seeing and a revelation, but there must also be a renewed revelation at the time the word is actually delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only then can the speaking be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what we mean by the reminding of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are in the ministry of the word must not only remember the words of a revelation, but the very picture of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless we can do this, we cannot be ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the reminding of the Holy Spirit, a man's past revelations are dead; they remain revelations that belong to one individual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Worse still, they are revelations that seemingly belong to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the memory of the Holy Spirit, any revelation can merely be seen as the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These revelations belong to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is useless to repeat these revelations without the reminding of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit must shine upon these revelations once again before they can become living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul first spoke about justification by faith, but Martin Luther had to see the very same thing justification by faith before he could speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same holds true for our own revelations we must see it once again before we can speak it and before it will produce any effect in others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to see the same revelations which we once saw.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the meaning of the reminding of the Holy Spirit, and this equips us for proper service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Question: What is the meaning of the words revelation, knowledge, prophecy, and teaching in 1 Corinthians 14:6?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: Prophecy is the speaking of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Teaching is based on the speaking of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation is the shining and enlightening which one receives from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Knowledge is what one has learned from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first two kinds revelation and knowledge are inward and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other two kinds prophecy and teaching are outward and open.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prophecy and teaching are communicative.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, revelation and knowledge are communicative as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The relationship between revelation and knowledge is similar to the relationship between prophecy and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The places revelation and knowledge hold with respect to each other are the same as the places prophecy and teaching hold with respect to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation is what a man sees inwardly under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Knowledge is the deposit that comes as a result of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God shines on man, he receives a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After he sees the revelation, something remains in him, which is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are inward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only those who have received revelation can prophesy, and only those who have knowledge can teach.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation resides within an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is useful only to him; this revelation is useless to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A revelation only becomes useful when it is communicated to others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This communication is prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the same way, knowledge resides in a man alone; it is useless to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It must also be communicated to others before it can become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This communication of knowledge is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The basis of prophecy is revelation, while the basis of teaching is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If teaching remains a teaching, without having knowledge, which is the effect of revelation, as its basis, this teaching will become a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God gives man revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a man speaks according to the instant revelation, he has a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When he speaks according to past revelation, he has a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The deposit of past revelations in a person is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The present speaking of past revelations is prophecy, while the present speaking of past knowledge is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation brings in prophecy, while knowledge brings in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Question: What is the place of human memory?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Answer: There is a place for our own memory, but the most important thing in our ministry of the word is not to interrupt our spirit with the activity of our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In fulfilling the ministry of the word, we should direct all our attention and energy to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to fully exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There must not be any distraction to frustrate the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the only way for the spirit to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The spirit is very sensitive; once it is frustrated, it is bound.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At times we need the help of the memory, but we must never frustrate the spirit when we are exercising our memory.</S>
