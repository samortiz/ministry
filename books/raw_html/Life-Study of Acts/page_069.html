<h2 class="head1">A TYPICAL CASE OF WATER BAPTISM</h2><p>In the case of Philip preaching the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch, we also have the matter of water baptism in 8:26-40. Today there is much debate among Christians concerning water baptism. Here in Acts 8 we have the case of a genuine Gentile believing in the Lord. From Isaiah 53 Philip &ldquo;brought the good news of Jesus to him&rdquo; (v. 35). Then &ldquo;as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch says, Look, water! What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo; (v. 36). The fact that the Ethiopian eunuch had such a reaction when seeing water indicates that Philip in his gospel preaching should have spoken to him about water baptism. If Philip had not said anything about baptism, it is not likely that the Ethiopian would have reacted in this way. Philip may still have been talking about water baptism when they came to the water in which the eunuch was baptized.</p><p>It is important for us to see that in this case of water baptism, a typical case, nothing is said about Spirit baptism. In particular, there is no mention of the Ethiopian eunuch speaking in tongues. Certainly if the eunuch had spoken in tongues, Luke would have given an account of this in his record. Since he records this case of water baptism, he surely would have recorded the experience of speaking in tongues had it taken place here. Those who promote tongue-speaking today need to pay attention to this case. This typical case of water baptism is a pattern, but in this pattern there is no mention at all of tongue-speaking. Luke&rsquo;s record here emphasizes water baptism.</p><h2 class="head1">WATER BAPTISM AND SPIRIT BAPTISM</h2><p>We have seen that the eunuch&rsquo;s reaction to seeing water indicates that Philip had preached water baptism to him. In this gospel case water baptism is particularly emphasized, but no mention is made of Spirit baptism. This should give us strong instruction that we must pay attention to water baptism, which signifies the believers&rsquo; identification with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection (Rom. 6:5; Col. 2:12), as well as to Spirit baptism. Spirit baptism signifies the reality of the believers&rsquo; union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically, whereas water baptism is the believers&rsquo; affirmation of the Spirit&rsquo;s reality. Both are needed (10:47), and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both, just as the children of Israel were baptized both in the cloud (signifying the Spirit) and in the sea (signifying water), as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 10:2.</p><p>Concerning baptism, water signifies death and burial for the termination of repentant people, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated ones. The death-water, pointing to and signifying the all-inclusive death of Christ into which His believers are baptized, buries not only the baptized ones themselves but also their sins, the world, and their past. It also separates them from the God-forsaking world and its corruption. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13), which is joined to Christ in the one Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule (John 3:3, 5), so that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">One Baptism</h2><p>In chapter eight of Acts, the eunuch received water baptism and Spirit baptism at the same time. There are not two baptisms, a water baptism and a Spirit baptism. Water baptism and Spirit baptism are one.</p><p>Bible teachers have debated whether the baptism in Romans 6 refers to water baptism or Spirit baptism. Actually, there is no need for argument about this, because in God&rsquo;s economy there is only one baptism. It would be wrong to ask whether this one baptism is water baptism or Spirit baptism. To ask such a question indicates a lack of knowledge. In the sight of God there is one baptism with two aspects&mdash;the aspect of water and the aspect of Spirit.</p><p>For God there is not the need of water, only of Spirit. However, as human beings, who are physical, we have the need for a material confirmation of spiritual things. Water baptism, therefore, is the outward affirmation of inward Spirit baptism.</p><p>Among many Christians today water baptism is merely a ritual for the receiving of new members. Our practice of baptism must be altogether different. Whenever we baptize someone in water, we need to have the faith that we are baptizing that person not only into water but also into the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God.</p>
