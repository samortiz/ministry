   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 6:1-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of the aspects of the reality of the kingdom mentioned in Matthew 5 are related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our natural life simply cannot produce the six items of the inward condition and the three items of the outward state.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By our natural birth we are dust, not salt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We become salt only by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once our nature is changed, our character is also changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We become salt instead of dust because we have a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have a new nature, a new element, and a new character by which we are the salt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition, by the new life we are also the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 1:4 says, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are the light because we have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we did not have the divine life, we could never be the light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are the light of the world because we have received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The life is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To say that we are the light of the world means that we have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we read that the kingdom of the heavens requires surpassing righteousness, perhaps our thought is, "Who can do this?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, at the end of chapter five we are told that we are the sons of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means we have the Father's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not adopted sons; we are sons born of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we have His life and nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is perfection in His life, and we have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our primary responsibility is to give the Father's life every opportunity to develop within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The developing will be the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we allow the life within to be developed, eventually the development of this life will be our perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not a matter of our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was in Christianity as a youth, I heard many sermons which quoted verses from Matthew 5.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In every case they applied this chapter to the improvement of human behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the requirements of the kingdom cannot be met by improved behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter how much we improve ourselves, we are still dust and not salt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can be salt only by receiving the life, nature, essence, and substance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God's divine life comes into us at the time of regeneration, we are transformed from dust into salt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Also, when we receive God's life, we become the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus mentioned the surpassing righteousness as a requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This qualification of excelling righteousness is also the marriage garment mentioned in 22:11-14 and Revelation 19:8.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Revelation 19, the Bride will be clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Three portions of the Word Matthew 5:20, 22:11-12, and Revelation 19:8 all indicate one thing: in order for us to enter into the marriage feast during the millennial kingdom, we need the surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have already seen, this righteousness comes out of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into us and became our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we eat Him and enjoy Him day by day, He will have the opportunity to spread into our being and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By this, Christ will be matured within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This spreading and maturing of Christ within us will become the surpassing righteousness, the marriage garment, required for attending the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To receive Christ into us qualifies us for salvation; to have Christ matured within us qualifies us for the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This corresponds to the concept of the kingdom that we have been emphasizing throughout this book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is simply the Lord Jesus coming into us and being matured in us until the kingdom comes in full.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would not allow Him to mature within us, how can we be in the full coming of the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although He has entered into us as the seed, He needs to grow in us and mature in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we give Him the opportunity to mature within us, we will certainly participate in the harvest, the full coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The maturity of Christ within us is the surpassing righteousness and will also be the marriage garment qualifying us to attend the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Receiving Christ into us qualifies us for salvation; allowing Christ to mature in us qualifies us for the marriage feast.</S>
