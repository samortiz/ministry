<h2 class="head1">THE FATHER&rsquo;S GLORIFICATION BEING HIS EXPRESSION<br />
THROUGH THE MULTIPLICATION OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Although each of the four Gospels refers to the matter of gospel preaching, the record in the Gospel of John is the most particular. At the end of Matthew the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel (Matt. 28:18-20), and at the end of both Mark and Luke the Lord also gave similar charges (Mark 16:15-16; Luke 24:46-48). In the Gospel of John, however, the Lord did not charge the disciples to preach the gospel. Instead, He told them that He wanted them to bear fruit. The Gospel of Matthew presents the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, the Gospel of Mark presents the preaching of the gospel to the whole creation, and the Gospel of Luke presents the preaching of the gospel for forgiveness of sins. The Gospel of John, however, is a book, a gospel, concerning life. Hence, in the Gospel of John the preaching of the gospel is mainly not in the way of proclaiming or preaching but in the way of releasing life.</p>
<p>In John 15:4-5 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; The branches&rsquo; abiding in the vine is not merely the preaching of the gospel but the overflowing of the inner life. For example, fruit trees in an orchard do not preach the gospel there; they just grow. Moreover, their full growth is the overflow of the life within them. This overflowing life will practically issue in much fruit. Hence, the fruit-bearing of the branches of the fruit trees is the issue of the overflow of their inner life.</p>
<p>In John 15 we see the same picture. There it says that the Father is glorified in that we bear much fruit (v. 8). Many Christians do not know what it means for the Father to be glorified. The Father&rsquo;s being glorified is His being multiplied. For example, suppose there is a young man who does not have any children after being married for ten years. Thirty years later he still has no children. Finally, when he is ninety years old, he remains barren. If you went to visit him at his home, you would see only an old man with his body bent over and his old wife who can hardly walk. Instead of having a sense of glory, you would have a sense of pity. However, suppose a young man after being married for twenty years has begotten twelve sons and eight daughters, and suppose all of his children also beget sons and daughters after their marriages, giving him fifteen grandchildren. He may be only fifty-five years old, yet he already has numerous offspring. If we saw how many offspring he had, we would admire him and say, &ldquo;Glorious, glorious! This is really glorious! You have produced so many offspring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our Father is glorified in that we bear much fruit. This means that the Father&rsquo;s divine life is expressed through our fruit-bearing as the branches of the vine, and in this He is glorified. When we see so many young people in the church rising up to love and serve the Lord and so many who are being brought into the church, we joyfully exclaim, &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; We exclaim this because the Father&rsquo;s divine life is being multiplied.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago when I first visited the Philippines, some among the responsible brothers at that time looked like trees with hardly any growth, and with some we could not tell whether they were little plants or stones. However, more than twenty years later they are all growing gray. Suppose that in the Philippines there was only a group of such elderly saints. Suppose that there were no young people, not to mention local people, who had been brought into the church, and that even the children of the elderly saints had been lost. If this were the case, our hearts would be frozen. If we heard the elderly saints singing weakly and feebly, we would surely weep and sob because if a church does not have young people, it has no posterity and therefore no future. However, when we see all the young people, especially the new ones, rising up, and when we hear them singing in the meeting, it is really glorious. This confirms what the Lord said: &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&rdquo; If the meeting halls in our localities are filled with young people, what a glory it will be!</p>
 <p>For this reason we all need to be reminded that we have to go forth and bear fruit. Every one of us has to make a vow before the Lord that we each will bear one fruit a year. If we cannot bring one person to the Lord; that is, bear one fruit for the Lord in one year (three hundred and sixty-five days), this will be a shame to us. Perhaps week by week we come alone to the meetings with only our Bible and hymnal. Five years ago it was so, and now, five years later, it is still the same&mdash;we have not brought one person with us. If this is our situation, then there is no glory at all. However, suppose next spring each of us brings a lamb, and in the second half of the year each one of us brings another lamb. Then we will all have the inward sense that this is glorious. If each of us would bring two lambs by the second half of next year so that all the seats of the meeting hall are filled, then the expression will be even more glorious.</p>
