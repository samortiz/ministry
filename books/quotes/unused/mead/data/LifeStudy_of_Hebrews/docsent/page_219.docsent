   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This again brings us to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we pointed out that the law of life is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christ who indwells our spirit is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What then is the law of life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is life functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A law is an unchanging, automatic regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever you throw an object into the air, the object will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the law of gravity which is an unchanging, automatic law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every life has its own law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have often used the illustration of a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you have a peach tree in your back yard, there is no need for you to worry that it might bring forth watermelons, or to say, I love the form and beauty of peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I don t want this tree to bring forth melons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since I m concerned that the fruit of this tree might not have the form of a peach, I ll make some peach molds, put them on the branches of the tree, and command the tree to fit into this pattern and not to change its form.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To do this would be ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this is exactly what Christianity does.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ministers and teachers in Christianity make molds, put them on people, and charge them to live in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you did this to a peach tree and the peach tree could talk, it would say, Take your molds away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I don t need any outward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have a living regulation by which I grow and bring forth fruit in the shape of peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The life will form the shape of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every year the peach tree produces fruit with a peach shape.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true of an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apple life has the apple law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As an apple tree grows, it spontaneously produces fruit in the shape of apples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the result of the regulation of the law in the life of an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This matter, however, is missed by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NO NEED FOR TEACHINGS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both in Jeremiah 31:33 and 34 and in Hebrews 8:10 and 11 we are told that we do not need anyone to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you would attempt to teach a peach tree to bring forth peaches, the tree would say, No one is as stupid as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can t teach me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Besides, I don t need your teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since coming to this country, especially during the first two years I was here, I told people wherever I went that they did not need to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said, You don t need teaching because you have life in you, and life needs no teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tell me, who taught you to breathe?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Did you attend a breathing school and graduate from it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No mother teaches her children to breathe, for breathing is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In like manner, no one instructs an apple tree to bring forth apples, because producing apples is the function of the life of an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the apple tree functions, apples are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During my first two years in this country, I was burdened to tell people wherever I went that they should drop their teachings and let life work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without one exception, I was rejected in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many came to me with their Bibles, saying, Brother Lee, in your message you said that we don t need any teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Isn t the word teaching found in the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I did not care to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I simply said, If you like teaching, you may have it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But I don t like teaching I like life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord that I have life and that life is growing within me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you like the teaching, go to the dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In some places I even boldly told people, You are as dead as a door nail.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The teachings have killed you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because you are filled to the brim with teachings, you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE ONE LAW BECOMING MANY LAWS</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have seen that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This Christ equals life, and this life has its law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, within us, we have Christ, the life, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The very Christ who indwells our spirit is life, and this life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Jeremiah 31:33 the Lord says, I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But Hebrews 8:10, which is a quotation of Jeremiah 31:33, says, I will impart my laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Notice that the law in Jeremiah 31:33 becomes the laws in Hebrews 8:10.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, in 8:10 the word mind is used instead of inward parts, indicating that the mind is one of the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The inward parts include at least the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the reason for these changes?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jeremiah 31:33 and Hebrews 8:10 say that God imparts His law, or laws, into either our inward parts or our minds, and that He inscribes His law, or laws, upon our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The heart is composed of the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hebrews 8:10 does not say that God imparts His laws into our hearts and inscribes them on our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No, it says that God imparts His laws into our mind and inscribes them on our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that Christ has firstly come into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This Christ is the law which must spread into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The spreading of the indwelling law into our mind is the imparting of this law into our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This law must also spread into our emotion and will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By spreading into our inward parts, the one law becomes many laws.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever we give this law the opportunity, it will spread within us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This spreading is the imparting, and the imparting is the inscribing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, the Lord imparts His law into our inward parts and inscribes it on our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As the Lord continues to spread, impart, and inscribe, Christ s image will be expressed in our soul, and we shall be conformed to the image of God s Firstborn Son.</S>
