   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Transformation Requiring Breaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There was a certain kind of sculpture in the ancient times which was made by grinding stones into powder, adding a cementing element to the powder, and then putting the compound into a mold until it solidified into a statue.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This process may be used in a limited way to describe transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the process of transformation we are ground into powder and mingled with the element of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we are put into the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross to be pressed and shaped.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually our original form is changed, and what comes out is a transformed character.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As fallen human beings, we inherited Adam's fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, our human character, which comes out of our natural being, whether good or bad, is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The unbelievers call the cultivation of character "the nurturing of human nature."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>History shows that people who nurture their humanity are strong in their will and able to exercise self-restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They develop a certain kind of character by their self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We Christians, however, are not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our Christian character is cultivated in the death of the Lord Jesus by the breaking of the life of our old creation and the addition of the element of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4 that our outer man is decaying day by day v. 16 . It is better to translate decaying into being consumed, being wasted away, or being worn out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our daily living, God is continually doing in us the work of consuming, wasting away, and wearing out through His hand, or through the environment, in order to break us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Breaking is a fitting word because it indicates that we should not remain whole.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who are whole cannot be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mineralogists know that diamonds are transformed from carbon that has undergone high heat and intense pressure underneath the earth for hundreds and thousands of years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All precious stones are formed in the same way; that is, they are transformed from natural substances that have gone through breaking, high temperature, and great pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same principle, if we desire to be transformed into precious stones, we also must pass through the same process and procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, Paul said, "We who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake" v. 11 . God works in us continually to break and consume us in order to grind us into powder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We already have the life of the Lord Jesus in us; however, if we remain intact, there is no way for this life to be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No element, regardless of what it is, can be mingled with a whole piece of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, in order to be mingled with the life of the Lord, we must be broken and crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we are broken, the element of the Holy Spirit can be added into us and be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then God will also raise up the environment as high temperature and intense pressure in order to transform us into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Way for God to Break Us</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Marriage is God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man or a woman is still not married after having passed the right age for marriage, there is great pressure upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet after they are married, their spouse also becomes a pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without having to learn, every husband knows by nature how to wear down his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, without having to learn, every wife knows by nature how to give her husband a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Someone may be altogether unmanageable, but once he sees his wife, he becomes just like a mouse coming face to face with a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Marriage life is a consuming life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being married and yet not being consumed is an impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why are there divorces?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is because some people give up on marriage life, unable to endure the sufferings any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sixty years ago when I was still young, an older person told me that marriage life is a "yoke."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as a person gets married, he is "yoked" and "shackled."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, is marriage good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, marriage is very good because it is sovereignly arranged by God for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is impossible to be transformed without first being ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same is true in the matter of bearing children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a woman has no child after she has been married three years, she is under a great deal of pressure to have children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, once she gives birth to a child, the child becomes an additional pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A certain sister may be very difficult to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before she is married, her parents do not know how to deal with her, and after she is married, her husband does not know how to deal with her either.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, after she gives birth to a difficult child, she will be consumed and softened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of how strong or stubborn you are, God has a way to break you and transform you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After seeing others being worn down by their children, a sister once said, "I do not believe it is that hard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wait till I have a child; I will discipline him and make him an obedient child."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, after having her own child, she was even more helpless than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You can call the police when your house has been burglarized.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if your children are disobedient, do you also call the police?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are afraid even to tell your neighbors or relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our children are the most capable of wearing us out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wives who wear out their husbands and the husbands who wear out their wives are not as skillful as the children who wear out their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The children's skillful wearing-out tactics really consume the parents.</S>
