<p>Anyone who answers the call to come and drink of the water of life will participate in the central goal of God&rsquo;s economy. This means that he will share in the dispensing of the processed Triune God and be a part of the bride of the Lamb for the satisfaction and expression of the processed and dispensing Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Fulfilling the Eternal Purpose<br />
of the Divine Economy of the Triune God</h2>
<p>This is to fulfill the eternal purpose of the divine economy of the Triune God according to His heart&rsquo;s desire for His pleasure (Eph. 1:9-11; 3:9-11) in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. LOOKING TO AND WAITING FOR<br />
THE LORD JESUS&rsquo; COMING BACK<br />
TO USHER THEM INTO THEIR FUTURE</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers&rsquo; experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God will also issue in their looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back to usher them into their future. Our future is an eternal married life with the Triune God. Now we are looking to that glorious day. We are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>The living of worldly people gives the impression that their future is on the earth and that their hope, destiny, and destination are thoroughly related to the present age. But this is not our situation. We are waiting for the Son of God to come from the heavens; hence, our future is focused on Him. To await the appearing of the Lord is a normal sign of true believers. According to 1 Thessalonians 1:9 and 10, we have turned to God from idols not only &ldquo;to serve a living and true God&rdquo; but also to &ldquo;await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:7 says that we are &ldquo;eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These two portions of the Word indicate an important characteristic of our Christian life: awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>As Christians, we must live a life of awaiting God&rsquo;s Son from the heavens, a life that declares to others that our hope is not on this earth or in this age. Rather, our hope is in the coming Lord, and our future is in Him. On this earth we do not have any destiny, destination, or future. Our future, our destiny, and our destination are altogether focused on the Lord who is coming. He is our hope, our future, and our destination. &ldquo;Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 3:20). Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens. Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth or associations of life, is not on this earth; it is in the heavens. We need to remember, therefore, that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth, awaiting the Savior, &ldquo;who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (v. 21).</p>
<p>While experiencing the stage of transformation in God&rsquo;s full salvation by the dispensing of the processed Triune God and after reading various portions of the Scriptures regarding the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we should, like John, express the desire from our deepest part as a prayer to hasten the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Our prayer should be &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; which is also the last prayer in the Bible (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, our enjoyment of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in our becoming, as the bride, one with the Spirit and also in our looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back to usher us into our future. The consummation of the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God will be a universal marriage. The Spirit with the bride become one to form a universal couple. This couple is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man and is the ultimate consummation of the divine romance as revealed in the Bible. According to the entire Bible, there is a divine romance between God the Creator, the Redeemer, who is the male, and His redeemed people, who are the female. The Bible begins with the marriage of Adam and Eve in Genesis and ends with the marriage of the Spirit and God&rsquo;s redeemed people in Revelation. At the end of the Bible, the Spirit and the bride call the thirsty ones to come and drink the water of life&mdash;the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God. We also should sound out a call to the thirsty ones to drink the water of life, the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God, so that thirsty sinners also may have a part in the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to be His bride. Anyone who would answer this call will participate in God&rsquo;s central goal for the fulfilling of the eternal purpose of the divine economy of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, our experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God will also issue in our looking to and waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to usher us into our future. We are looking to that glorious day; we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. This is an important characteristic of our Christian life. As Christians, we must live a life that declares to others that our hope is not on this earth or in this age. Our hope is in the coming Lord. Our national life, our real citizenship, is not on this earth; it is in the heavens. While experiencing the stage of transformation in God&rsquo;s full salvation by the dispensing of the processed Triune God and after reading various portions of the Scriptures regarding the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we should, like John, express the desire from our deepest part as a prayer to hasten the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Our prayer should be &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
