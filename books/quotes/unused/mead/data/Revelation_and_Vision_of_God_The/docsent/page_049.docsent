   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THIRD ITEM OF THE VISION THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter and the following chapter I feel burdened to speak to you concerning another basic truth the accomplishments of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On man's side, mankind has close to six thousand years of history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On God's side, God has been existing since eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What are the things accomplished by Christ in time?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a matter that we must see.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Creating All Things Forming the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the records of the Old and New Testaments, God made a plan and established His economy in eternity past, but then He did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was decided that all the things that God wanted to do in His economy would be carried out by the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son came as Christ to receive the commission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word for Christ is Christos, which is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ was God's Messiah, God's Anointed, the One appointed by God to carry out God's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus was not appointed after He was born as a man; rather, He had already been appointed in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In eternity past the Triune God decided that the Lord Jesus would come to accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was the One who would fulfill the mission of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must see that in the universe there are "eternity" and "time."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eternity is without beginning and without ending, whereas time has a beginning and an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When did time begin?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It began from God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ created the universe and when the created things began their existence, that was the beginning of time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:3 says, "All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Came into being means "came into existence."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the Lord Jesus did not create from things already existing; rather, He commanded something into being out of nothing, calling the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He spoke, "Let there be," then all things came into being, came into existence, at once.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally, the heavens were not there, but He said, "Let there be the heavens!" and the heavens came into existence out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way the earth also came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All things were brought forth in this way out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the heavens and the earth came into existence, time began.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God's appointed One, Christ bore the responsibility of carrying out God's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first thing He accomplished was the creation of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, after the beginning of time, He went on to have many more great accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of us who serve the Lord must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The purpose of His creation of all things was to bring in the universe and to form the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Chinese, universe implies time plus space.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Hebrew expression for universe refers to the totality of all the ages in succession.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 1:2b says, "Through whom also He made the universe."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Bible readers often come across expressions that are not so easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that very few Bible readers understand the meaning of universe; therefore, I added a note to this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The definition given in this note is based upon Vincent's definition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After studying this word for a long time, I considered his definition as the best, so I excerpted it into a note in the New Testament Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The note says, "Lit., ages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The ages is a Jewish expression that means the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ages here does not refer to the matter of time but to creation the universe unfolded in time through successive ages."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we see that the universe is composed of ages, that is, the successive ages in time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Most Christians know that Christ created the heavens, the earth, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But very few know that after His creation He is still continually forming the ages, age after age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the universe refers not only to the heavens and the earth but also to all the ages in the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, after the creation of the heavens and the earth, Adam was created; thus, there was the age of Adam with all its stories.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the age of Adam was over, the age of Noah with its stories began.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the age of Noah, the age of Abraham with its stories occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the age of Abraham was over, the age of Moses came, at which time the law was decreed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the age of Moses was over, the age of David came.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then after all the ages of the Old Testament, there was the age of Jesus Christ, the age of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These ages did not take place by development or evolution; rather, they were founded, instituted, by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus not only created the heavens, the earth, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After creating the heavens and the earth, He instituted the ages, age after age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there were only the heavens, the earth, and all things, without the succession of ages, then none of the stories could have happened, and there would be no universe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, the universe includes not only time and space but also all the stories that happened in time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is just like the scenes in a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In every scene the characters do not just stand still; rather, they are acting out the story according to the script.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every scene is an age.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus not only created the roles for us but also established the content of each scene; thus, the universe came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the entire history of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The universe is a play with many scenes, and the Lord Jesus is not only the Director but also the Producer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The purpose of His forming the universe is to afford God the opportunity to obtain what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>People do not understand why a big war is going on today or why a small battle will transpire tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many things have happened age after age, but people in the world do not understand the mysteries hidden in all these occurrences.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet, these things that have happened successively have given God the opportunity to gain us one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If it were not for the changing scenes in the world, none of us would be a Christian today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Among the saints who are sitting here, some are from other countries and some have a different color of skin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet we can use either Chinese or English both in singing or in praying, without much need for translation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Who can gather and blend us together in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only the Lord can.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord in His sovereignty raised up the environment for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some of you might not be saved if you had not been born in Taiwan; others might not be saved if they had not gone to America.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I met some Chinese students in America who said that when they were in Taiwan, they were not interested in the gospel and they disliked hearing about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yet when they went to America, they just wanted Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord was not able to capture them in Taiwan, but He captured them in America.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All these things happened in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The universe creates the opportunity for God to gain what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I very much appreciate the training here in Taiwan, in which the East and the West are blended and have become one family.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In China forty years ago, to travel from my hometown, Chefoo, to Shanghai, one could take only the boat, and it would take forty-eight hours.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today it takes only twelve hours to fly from Anaheim in the United States to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Eighteen hours ago I made a telephone call from Taiwan to Anaheim and told the saints who were coming to Taiwan the things that I needed; now they have brought these things to me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is really convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This morning the ministry station announced that while I am releasing a message here, thirty-six places in the United States would be able to listen in English and twenty-six places would be able to listen in Chinese simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I hope that one day we will be able to transmit by man-made satellites.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then the messages that are released here can be simultaneously heard in Japan, Indonesia, and other places.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the way we will take so that the messages that are being released in one place can be heard at the same time throughout the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All these things belong to the realm of the "universe" accomplished by Christ.</S>
