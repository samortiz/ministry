   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this term of the training I hope to speak specifically on "The Revelation and Vision of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The messages, each of which is a spiritual weapon, can be used not only for this term of the training.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE MEANING OF REVELATION AND VISION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You are familiar with these two words: revelation and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the recently saved ones who have come into the church life for only a short time may not fully understand what revelation and vision mean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Generally, in their concept, people consider these two words synonyms, thinking that a revelation is a vision and a vision is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, they are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what revelation means: A scene that includes all kinds of persons, things, and matters is covered, concealed, by a veil so that the mysteries contained therein cannot be known; then one day the veil is opened and the scene behind it is shown.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Chinese expression ch'i shih means "to open" and "to show."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Greek, the word for revelation means "the opening of the veil."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible many spiritual, divine, heavenly persons, things, and matters were hidden in God, who created all things Eph 3:9 , and became therefore hidden mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then one day God opened the veil to us so that we were able to see the mysteries behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible there is a book called Revelation, indicating that it opens the mysteries and shows them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, revelation is God's opening of the veil and disclosing of everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is vision?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Literally, the Chinese expression i-hsiang means an "uncommon, special scene."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, vision denotes an extraordinary scene.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, someone may have a house with exquisite decorations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once you enter in and take a look, you immediately sense something uncommon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To you that is an uncommon scene; that is a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible vision refers to the scenery we see from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through His Word God has opened the veil, but we must see the scenes contained in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever we see through God's revelation is a vision.</S>
