The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him
To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us
2 Just as manna sustained nearly two million people in the wilderness for forty years, so Christ as the real manna sustains the church today
Numbers 11:9 also tells us that manna came with the dew: 'And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it'
Since we all love the Lord, and we know that the Lord desires to build up His Body by our growth in life, we must have a daily revival
Yesterday morning we may have had a revival, but this morning we need another one, and tomorrow we need another one
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day'
11 We Christians who are seeking after the Lord should live a life in which we have a new revival, a new sunrise, every day
Some people consider that it is impossible to know today that we are saved, while others think that after we are saved we may still perish
The Bible shows us, however, that our salvation is not a matter of speculation nor is it a matter of uncertainty
The Bible clearly reveals that when a person believes he is forgiven of his sins freed washed sanctified justified and reconciled to God
John 1:12-13 clearly points out that anyone who believes in the Lord is born of God and becomes a child of God
As long as a man believes into the Lord Jesus he is regenerated he has Gods eternal life and he will not perish forever that is he is saved
As long as we believe, we have eternal life, and we are no longer condemned or judged; we have passed out of death into life
He says that whoever believes that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord is saved
By the Spirit's inner witnessing with our spirit we can know with certainty that we are God's children and that we are saved
By the clear words of the Bible, by the sensation in our spirit, and by the experience of love, we can know with certainty that we are saved
John 4:10 says, 'Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins'
Because of God's inseparable love, His salvation within us will never fail; it is forever secure and unchanging
Since God's calling comes out of His invariable being and is according to His unchanging will, it is irrevocable and unalterable
In John 10:29 the Lord said, 'My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand'
At the same time, this covenant is an eternal covenant , which will remain eternally and is effective eternally
Because God is faithful and is One who keeps His covenant , He will never break His covenant but will fulfill it in us accordingly
By offering Himself on the cross without blemish as the one sacrifice to God, Christ has accomplished an eternal redemption
No one can condemn us any longer , nor can anyone nullify the perfect, complete, and eternal redemption which Christ has accomplished for us
The first thing God did in the beginning of the New Testament dispensation was to send John the Baptist to preach the baptism of repentance
Baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect is the baptism in water; the invisible aspect, the baptism in the Holy Spirit
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
All believers in Christ should properly have both, just as the children of Israel were baptized in the cloud and in the sea -1 Cor
28:19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
3:20-21 While the ark was being prepared; entering into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water
32 To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him
34 Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ
We praise the Lord that we have been baptized into the organic entity of the Body of Christ for His expression
On the one hand, they entered the ark by faith and were saved through the ark, thus escaping God's judgment by the flood
Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh -the dirt of our fallen nature and the defilement of fleshly lust
The first crucial and striking point concerning God's creation of man is that God created man in His image and according to His likeness
We were not only created according to the image of Christ, but we were also created as vessels instead of instruments
It says that the Lord is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Without God being the Spirit and without us having a spirit to contact God to be one with God the whole universe is empty and we are nothing
The birth of the spirit in John 3:6 is not the first birth, the natural birth; it is the second birth, the spiritual birth
The first birth, from our parents, is the birth in the flesh; the second birth, from God, is the birth in our spirit
Within our created spirit we also have the Spirit of God, who is our Redeemer and who became the life-giving Spirit
Your being saved is not just a matter of your sins being forgiven, your being cleansed by the blood, or your being redeemed and regenerated
More than that, the Lord as the Spirit has entered your regenerated spirit and mingled with your regenerated spirit to become one spirit
Whenever we stop the activities of our body and our soul, allow the Spirit to work in us, and call from our spirit, 'O God!
10:12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him
Cry out and give a ringing shout, / O inhabitant of Zion, / For great in your midst is the / Holy One of Israel'
Not only did the Old Testament saints call on the Lord; they even prophesied that others would call on His name
Calling on the name of the Lord was practiced by the New Testament believers beginning on the day of Pentecost
Today the Lord wants to recover calling on His name and to have us practice it so that we may enjoy the riches of His life
As we have seen earlier, the way to draw water from the springs of salvation is to call upon the name of the Lord
If you have never called, even shouted before the Lord, it is doubtful that you have enjoyed the Lord in a rich way
Another reason for calling on the Lord is to be rescued from distress , from trouble , and from sorrow and pain
Isaiah gives us the way in verse 6 of the same chapter: 'Seek Jehovah while He may be found; / Call upon Him while He is near'
When we feel that we are down or low, we can lift and stir ourselves up by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
Timothy 222 says But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness faith love peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
In this weeping book there are two wonderful, joyful verses: 'I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit
The sixteenth President of the United States of America Abraham Lincoln once said that the Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man
It is the world's most widely read book and has been translated into over one thousand languages, more than any other book in the world
God's intention in His economy is to dispense Christ into us, and for this dispensing there must be some means
Sometimes we may not understand what we read, and sometimes we may understand but not be able to utter what we see
44 But He answered and said It is written Man shall not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God
These verses are important to us because they tell us clearly how to taste the Lord: drink 'the guileless milk of the Word'
If we take the Word of God as the tree of knowledge, we misuse the Bible, because 2 Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the letter kills
The second example of someone eating the Word of God is recorded in the book of Ezekiel, where the prophet Ezekiel ate the Word of God
God's Word is an enjoyment; after it is taken into us and assimilated into our very being, it becomes joy within us and gladness without
From these verses we realize that the Word of God is not only for us to learn but even more for us to taste to eat to enjoy and to digest
We must confess all of our sins to make ourselves pure and clean, without any hindering thing between us and God
You can pray-read not only in one way but in many ways: by yourself, with your spouse, with a group, and in the meetings
Paul said that we should receive the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition
When the words are merely words, they are only black letters printed on the white paper; they are not the Spirit
When the words get into your mind through your eyes and you begin to pray with your spirit, then the words become the Spirit
John 5:39-40 You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me
No matter how much God breathes out, if we do not breathe in, we cannot receive God as our enjoyment and supply
The words of the Bible are the breathing out of God, but when you turn them into prayer, they become your breathing in
It is necessary not only for the food to be prepared in the kitchen and set on the table; it is also necessary that you come to eat it
Whenever we touch the Word and let the Word abide in us, we touch the Lord Himself and let the Lord Himself abide in us
To have the Lord abiding in us is simply to take His Word into us, because the Lord is in His Word and is the Word
If you try to strike a safety match on the paper cover, it will not catch fire, because you are striking the match on the wrong spot
On one hand, we have the match, the phosphorus, and the fire; on the other hand, we have the Bible, the Spirit, and the life
25-26 Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word
In sanctifying the church, the Lord firstly washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life
If we read and prayread the Bible in a proper way even musing upon the Word singing it and dwelling in it our inner being will be filled
We also have the living water flowing within us to wash away the old elements, the wrinkles and the spots, and to renew us
When we are filled with the Word and washed by it, our entire being is renewed and transparent, and we have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem
These heavenly elements and spiritual ingredients will cause us to have not only an outward change but a metabolic change, a change in life
From that day, the life they lived was new, the way on which they walked was new, and all the things they did were new
God's forgiveness is based upon the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, and it is also the issue of our repentance and faith
Because of our enjoyment of God's salvation, God's life in us causes us to have a change in our mood, taste, and feeling toward the world
, the clearance of the past is not according to the demand of outward regulations but according to the moving of the Spirit within
80 The religions of the world are built on their various religious codes, and their followers live and behave according to these rules
The Spirit will definitely require us by the holy life within us to remove all demonic and dirty things and to cut off the old way of living
These pictures represent human superstitions, and in the eyes of God they are blasphemous; hence, they should be disposed of
We should use our spirit to worship the Lord, who is Spirit ; we should not use our physical body to worship a visible image
Acts 19:19 tells us that the Ephesian believers who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them
Other examples are gambling instruments, utensils for alcoholic drinking, pipes for smoking, obscene books, and pornographic pictures
In brief, anything related to idols and any demonic and filthy thing, however valuable it may be, should be burned
The Bible records, in particular, that the price of the items which were burned by the Ephesians was fifty thousand pieces of silver
A third example of the clearance of the past is seen in the case of Zaccheus, in his restoring of what he owed others
Suppose that before you became a believer, you had extorted or defrauded others, stolen from them, or obtained things by improper means
After we have been born again, there is still much work for God to do in our lives, and there is also much service that we can render to God
Everyone who has had a true experience of consecration has at least once, but possibly many times, known the touch of the love of God
The security of our consecration depends upon its basis; but the vitality and sweetness of our consecration depends on its motive power, i
The principle is this: The bullock originally lived in a corral and was used for plowing the field and drawing carts
When these were offered as a burnt offering, they were burnt on the altar and became a sweet savor, food for God
Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God
When we consecrate ourselves to God, although it is to work for God, yet from our standpoint the emphasis is to let God work
If the sacrifices were not consumed by fire, they would be raw and foul-smelling and could never be acceptable or pleasing to God
If we want to touch spiritual things we must first allow God to work on us that we might be broken, subdued, and disciplined by Him
1:9 Then the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah
When a bullock was taken for sacrifice and offered upon the altar, he was immediately cut off from all his previous relationships
All his choicest parts were changed to a sweet-smelling savor to God, and all that was left was a heap of ashes
The future we are speaking about includes not only our future in this world, but also our future in the so-called Christian world
He lives purely and simply in the hand of God; he is what God wants him to be and does what God wants him to do
If our consecration is not sound, sooner or later problems will arise in our service and in our spiritual condition
Brothers and sisters, this result of abandoning all our future prospects always needs to be kept fresh within us
We must realize that it is not possible to hit the climax of any experience of life by experiencing it just once
We need to pursue continuously, so that our experience will increase gradually and become fuller, until it reaches the stage of maturity
As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us
1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
28:13 He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy
Dealing' implies that we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to purge away all the difficulties which hinder the growth of life
Before we consecrate ourselves, or when we depart from a consecrated position, we do not realize that we need to be dealt with
If we desire to fulfill the purpose of our consecration, we need to have all our difficulties dealt with one by one
Among all the difficulties which need to be dealt with, sins are the crudest, the most defiling, and the most evident
The dealing with sins of which we are speaking is our dealing with the sins which we commit outwardly, the sins in our actions
Romans 21415 says that those of the nations which have no law are a law to themselves they show the work of the law written in their hearts
Their conscience is the law within them which bears witness, and their thoughts either accuse or else excuse them
These sinful acts always fall short of the glory of God and, in either a perceptible or an imperceptible manner, hurt others
On one hand we need to deal with our record of sin before God, and on the other hand we need to deal with the fact of our sinning
Our dealing with sins is based only on the consciousness while in fellowship with God not on all the facts of all the sins we have committed
If we are aware of only ten percent, we deal with ten percent; if we are aware of twenty percent, we deal with twenty percent
Everyone should learn to deal with sins only according to his own consciousness at the time he is in fellowship with the Lord
1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
His blood satisfied the requirement of God's law on our behalf; therefore, all our record of sin before God has been abolished
1 John 1:9 were written by the apostle to those who are saved, and they refer to all the sins we commit after we are saved
When we deal with sins before man, there are four basic principles we should remember and by which we should abide
If the answers to these questions conform to the four principles, we may bravely proceed then to deal with the sin
When we restore what we have taken, we should pay according to the original value and add a little more to compensate for the loss
The damage caused by sin and the world upon man differ greatly: sin contaminates man, whereas the world both contaminates and possesses man
Satan corrupts man by using sin but he gains man by employing the world thus causing him to depart from the presence of God and become lost
Demas, a co-worker of Paul, was deprived of his usefulness before God because he loved the present world and became usurped by it
For this reason he has a little knowledge concerning sin, that which is against morality, and is conscious of its contamination
As for the world, which is in opposition to God, he has no knowledge of it, neither is he conscious of its usurpation
If we desire to grow in life and be gained by the Lord, we must make an effort to deal with the world that enslaves us
At the creation of man, there were only the universe, the heaven and earth, and all things; the world did not exist
Adam in the garden of Eden had no need to worry, plan, or prepare anything for himself, for God was responsible for everything
In order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement
When mankind lived a godless life, Satan immediately disguised himself and utilized these avenues as a means to possess man
Later, Satan organized these into a more tangible and systematized world, thus entangling mankind in a tighter web
When people, activities, or things-whether good or bad, beautiful or ugly-enslave man, they comprise the world
The world denotes the enemy's scheme, system, and organization to usurp the place of God in man and finally to gain full possession of man
Concerning the definition of the world the Bible gives some explanations First the difference between the world and the things in the world
We see that the world is in opposition to God, and the age or the things in the world are in opposition to the will of God
We can say that anything that goes beyond our daily necessities is taking the place of God and possessing us thus it needs to be dealt with
The standard of our living necessities must be determined by ourselves through prayer and seeking the mind of God
We cannot measure our standard according to that of others nor demand that they agree with our views and feelings
If we wish to practice dealing with the world, we should pay our attention to one point-that is, to close our mind to the world
When we endeavor to deal with the world, we should be determined and violent to shut out any thoughts of the world
12:12 For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ
We cannot manifest our personality through any one member of our body-the ears, mouth, eyes, hands, or feet-alone
The words out from whom in verse 19 indicate that something is coming out from the Head to cause the Body to grow
117 If we would grow, we need to get into the Word, feed on the Word, and exercise our spirit to pray and to receive the Lord each day
Although even ten minutes is good, it is best to spend thirty minutes to enjoy Him at the start of each new day
If you spend thirty minutes to absorb the Lord and to enjoy Him in the morning, you will not be bothered by negative things during the day
120 Forget your situation, your condition, your failures, and your weaknesses and simply take time to enjoy the Lord
The growth of the Body of Christ is through the members growing into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding to truth in love
125 In God's sight, whenever we speak something that is not necessary, whether it is good or bad, that is gossiping
An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren
According to my experience, the most difficult matter in which to grow up into Christ, the Head, is in our talking
127 We should speak those things that bring us into contact with Christ and that build us up as the Body of Christ
129 Some of the sisters spend a great deal of time to style their hair, and yet they say that they do not have time for morning revival
136 The joints are the specially gifted members of the Body, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
By this rich supply of Christ, all the members of the Body will get the nourishment with which they will grow in life
139 First Corinthians 14 stresses that the top gift the gift that excels all other gifts developed by our enjoyment of Christ is prophesying
To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others
The fact that all may learn and all may be encouraged also shows that this is not predicting but speaking for the Lord
We must be flexible, walking according to the Spirit, and receiving instant and fresh inspiration all the time
We should all be like bees, having the consciousness of the Body so that we can live together with other members in the Body of Christ
The real significance is that we have become the members of the Body of Christ, possessing the same one life and needing one another
The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name
In gathering us together in His name, the Lord rescues us from all kinds of worldly and earthly distractions and occupations
For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name
Today the whole world takes Sunday not mainly for worship but for pleasures, for sports, and for all kinds of entertainment
On one hand, we remember how the Lord gave Himself for us, and on the other hand, we also have to give to the Lord on this day
Offering material goods to the Lord on His day is something that we should start practicing the moment we believe
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
The Greek word translated church in these verses is ekklesia, composed of two words: ek, out, and kaleo, called
According to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God
In Exodus when God's salvation was brought in, right away there was the demand of the assembly of God's people
We need to learn how to trust in the Lord, abide in Him, fellowship with Him, and deal with Him and be dealt with by Him
We will know Christ in a practical way and experience Him in our spirit, and when we come to the meetings, we will have something of Christ
The goal of our meeting is to exhibit Christ, and the Christian meeting is an exhibition of the Christian daily life
167 In the beginning of the church life the larger gatherings were needed, but the larger gatherings were not a daily need
168 Thus, the church should have regular separate home meetings and should gather together in one place as the need arises
Among all the meetings in the church life, no other meeting is as intimate, as practical, and as all-inclusive as the group meeting
175 Furthermore, if we do not have these things, it is difficult to have the mutual teaching through asking and answering questions
176 For the perfecting of the saints, there is the need of teaching in the group meetings, and in the group meetings all are teachers
Not only were Moses and Joshua the servants of God, but all the Israelites who were led out of Egypt were the servants of God as well
We need two kinds of understanding about the blood of the Lord, and we need two kinds of knowledge about the Lord Himself
A saved person wishes to serve the Lord, not out of others' encouragement or compelling, but out of an inward motive
To serve the Lord with our whole being means that the spirit, soul, and body all participate in the service of the Lord
In Romans 12:1 Paul exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is our most reasonable service
The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying
The hands cannot detect the smell of an object; it takes the nose to serve the body with its smelling function
According to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests
To say that a priest is a person who serves God is right, but to say that to serve God is merely to do something for God is wrong
In the Old Testament types there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
To be holy simply means to be sanctified, and to be sanctified simply means to be separated from the common things unto the divine things
When we as a Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God
The coordination, the separation, and the authority- these three are the qualifications, the equipment we need to minister,
The gospel is the glad tidings and the good news of great joy, which God asked His servants to announce to men
It includes the preaching of God the condemnation of God upon fallen man and the Body life including the local churches in chapter sixteen
The main sacrifices he offers to God are living persons, sinners who have been regenerated to become members of the living Christ
The group meetings will have the fellowship, the interceding, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the mutual teaching
We will be enlightened by Him to see all our defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, trespasses, and transgressions
Our neighbors should be considered as our second circle, and our classmates and colleagues as our third circle
The Lord told His disciples that they would be His witnesses in Jerusalem , in Judea , in Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth
A record book should have the following columns The first column should be a number the second column the date and the third column the name
Acts 4:31 And when they had so besought, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness
The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church
We have to present these people one by one to the Lord and pray for them fervently before we can effectively lead them to Christ
In 1980 the Living Stream Ministry published Gospel Outlines, containing two hundred sixty-six outlines for gospel messages
The apostle Paul had a great deal to speak because the Old Testament was a rich source of light and truth to him
We should put them on our breast and shoulders , bearing them in love and in power into the presence of the Lord
