   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEAVENLY LADDER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the divine principles of God's building are in this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The divine building is the opening of heaven to the earth so that heaven is joined to the earth and the earth is united to heaven by the heavenly ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To see what this ladder is, we must refer to John 1:51, which says, "And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No doubt, this is a reference to Genesis 28.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 28 there is a ladder upon which the angels of God ascend and descend, while in John 1 this ladder is the Son of Man, upon whom the angels of God ascend and descend.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the ladder is the Lord Jesus Himself as the Son of Man, the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, in 14:6 the Lord said, "I am the way ; no one comes to the Father except through Me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is not the flat way but the vertical way by whom and through whom we come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the way, He is the ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is He who brings heaven to earth, and it is He who unites earth with heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is He who brings God into man and man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the very way, the vertical way, to bring God and man together and to make heaven and earth one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1:51, the Lord said that the angels of God ascend and descend not upon the Son of God but upon the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first verse of this chapter the Lord is the eternal Word in eternity past as the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in the last verse of this chapter the Lord is the Son of Man in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could the eternal Word become the Son of Man?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was by becoming flesh in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal Word was incarnated to be the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Son of Man is God mingled with man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is a man of heaven yet on earth, a man on the earth yet still in heaven and from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This wonderful Son of Man brings God and man together and makes heaven and earth one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, He is the real ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not forget that John 1:51 is a reference to Genesis 28.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the heavenly ladder in Genesis 28 there was an open heaven and Bethel, the house of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows us that with the Lord Jesus as the heavenly, vertical way there is the opening of heaven and the house of God on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE OIL POURED UPON THE STONE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 28:18-19a says, "And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And he called the name of that place Bethel."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jacob gave the name Bethel to not only that place but to the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That stone, which was Bethel, the house of God, was the resting place of the wanderer where he could lay his head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, this resting place for man is also the very dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only the place, but the stone which had oil poured upon it, the pillow upon which man rested, is a Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where man rests, God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For there to be a house of God on earth, there must be stones upon which oil is poured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Scriptures, oil signifies the Holy Spirit, the third of the Triune God who comes to visit man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God is hidden in the heavens, He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one can know the Father in Himself, and no one has ever seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God comes out to express Himself to man and among man, He is the Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then when God comes upon people and into people to visit them in a subjective way, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, oil is a symbol of the Triune God visiting people in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What then is the stone?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be sure, the stone is the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is why in Jacob's dream there was first the stone as the material and then the house of God, the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the oil was poured upon the stone, it became the house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, when we come to the Lord, we are living stones who are being built up as a spiritual house in the Spirit, by the Spirit, and with the Spirit 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are the stones upon whom the Triune God has poured the Holy Spirit as the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The building of God is a matter of God pouring Himself upon us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are the stones, and He is the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When He pours Himself upon us, we with the oil become Bethel, the house of God, the temple of God in which the Spirit of God dwells.</S>
