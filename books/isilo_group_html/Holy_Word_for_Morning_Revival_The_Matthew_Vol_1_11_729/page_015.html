It was accomplished through Mary&#8217;s surrender (Luke 1:26-38), the conceiving power of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35), and Joseph&#8217;s obedience and coordination (Matt. 1:19-21, 24-25). From Joseph we should learn that in the midst of trouble and misunderstanding we should not make decisions too fast; rather, give the Lord a chance to come in.</p><p>The last part of Matthew 1 deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel. Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man. Three elements are in the name of Jesus. 1) Jehovah-&#8220;I Am Who I Am&#8221; (Exo. 3:14), 2) Savior, and 3) Salvation. Emmanuel is the second name (1:23). When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us. Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the Spirit, He dwells in our spirit. The Spirit is simply the reality of Jesus&#8217; presence (John 14:16-20). This presence is Emmanuel, God with us.</p><p>The way to find Christ is revealed in Matthew 2. We need to follow the living vision, the heavenly star. Although the Jewish religionists were for the knowledge of the Bible, they were not for the living person of the Messiah. We all need to pray, &#8220;Lord, give me a heart for You. I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible. But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You.&#8221;</p><p>Matthew 3 covers the recommendation and anointing of the King. He was recommended by one whose coming terminated the dispensation of law and began the dispensation of grace. John&#8217;s message was, &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&#8221; (Matt. 3:2). Repentance means a change of mind. To repent unto the Lord with our whole being and with our whole heart and to let the Lord come in is to prepare the way of the Lord.</p><p>The Lord &#8220;came from Galilee to the Jordan&#8221; to be baptized by John (3:13). Galilee, a despised region, signifies rejection. Jordan signifies termination and germination. The wonderful church life sooner or later will terminate us all. It is in this place of termination that we meet the King. Likewise, the Lord&#8217;s baptism enabled Him through death and resurrection to minister not in a natural way but in the way of resurrection.</p><p>In Matthew 4 the heavenly King was tested by the devil. But the Lord Jesus overcame every aspect of the enemy&#8217;s temptation. He could say, &#8220;My living is secondary. I don&#8217;t care for religious power. And worldly glory has nothing to do with Me. I know only God&#8217;s word and God Himself. I care only to serve God.&#8221; Therefore, as the One who passed the test, the Lord Jesus was qualified to be the King of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Matthew, Vol. 1 (1:1-7:29) &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
