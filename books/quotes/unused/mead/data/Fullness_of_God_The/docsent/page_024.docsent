   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Having the Presence of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we speak in the meetings, we need to obey the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes, when someone makes an incorrect announcement, a young person can point it out in a proper manner in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that we are not in our spirit when we correct other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can correct others in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, it is not easy to correct others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not say, Brother, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Did you not hear what Brother Lee said?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why was your announcement so confusing?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not quarrel, because when we quarrel, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that we cannot adjust one another, but we need a proper attitude when we adjust others and when others adjust us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we are human, we will make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only God does not make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we believe that we are never wrong, we must consider ourselves to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have been giving messages for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes certain situations are exposed when I release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once, when I was in the Philippines, the brothers and sisters were concerned that I would mention their names in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At another time I stayed in the home of an elderly sister and asked her about her prayer, not knowing that she had not prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was the exposing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When unbelievers see this, they will say, Indeed God is among you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Between 1941 and 1943 we held gospel meetings in Chefoo during the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During this time there was a deaconess who was a widow and had a son who refused to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This sister brought her son to a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In that meeting I pointed at him and said, You say you have not sinned, but you have stolen chalk from school.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This caused him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s presence is real in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On another occasion in a gospel meeting in Chefoo, I spoke of how women make their husbands work many hours to support them so that they can have high-heeled shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A woman in the audience, who had accompanied a friend to the meeting, was unhappy when she heard this, and she accused her friend of exposing her situation to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sister assured her that I did not know who she was and that it was the Lord s grace to allow someone to point out her sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These words subdued her, and she confessed that she was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we preach the gospel, we should not give dead messages in a mechanical way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we stand up to speak, we should have the faith to declare, The economical Spirit has been poured upon the church and is upon me as I speak for the Lord in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we meet in the Lord s name, His Spirit is in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actively Preaching the Gospel and</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Leading People to Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The young brothers and sisters should also preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the present leading, there will now be co-workers preaching the gospel on the large campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that the young people will cooperate with the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the Lord s Day the young people are in the ministry meeting and the bread-breaking meeting, and during the week they have a campus meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We hope that they can set aside one or two evenings to labor with the co-workers in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This may be in a Bible study or in a gospel seminar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We hope that the young people who are students, whether in college or in a special trade school, would bring a minimum of two people to the Lord every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, they should not think that they cannot remain in the church if they do not bring two people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The students should encourage one another to attend the meetings on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The bread-breaking meeting is usually at the meeting hall, and sometimes it may be in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During the week they should have a small group meeting with other students to fellowship and encourage one other.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, they should do their best to help with the campus gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the personal side they should spend five minutes to pray and ten minutes to read the Bible every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way they will make significant progress every year.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During their vacation time they should read a few Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By practicing these matters from their freshman year to their senior year, they will advance every year.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will be well nourished and receive a good education in the truth to be proper children in God s house who live a life of loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In conclusion, we must know that Christ is our life, the truth is our freedom, and the church of the living God is our house.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, we need to see that our living must be a life of preaching the gospel to lead people to receive salvation and turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the young saints should understand, know, and actively practice and experience these four points.</S>
