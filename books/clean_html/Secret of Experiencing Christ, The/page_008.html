We must see the two major aspects concerning the Person of Christ. The first aspect is that He is the complete God, and the second aspect is that He is the perfect man. Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man. In brief, He is both God and man. We do have a wonderful Christ. He is not only wonderful as the complete God, but He is also wonderful as the perfect man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERFECT MAN</H2><P>In this chapter we will see seventeen items concerning Christ as the perfect man. If we do not have a clear vision concerning Christ as these seventeen items, we cannot know Christ in full.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Conceived of the Holy Spirit<br>in a Human Virgin</H2><P>This perfect Man, Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35). The conception of a person is the constitution of that person. Christ was constituted of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin. As we saw in the previous message, the Holy Spirit is the Triune God. When we touch any One of the Three, the Father, the Son, or the Spirit, we touch the Triune God. Both Matthew 1:18 and 20 and Luke 1:35 tell us that Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit. This means that the very Christ was conceived of the Triune God. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, yet in a human virgin. The word Holy refers to the Spirit, indicating the complete God, and the word human refers to mankind, since a virgin is part of mankind. This means that Christ was conceived of the complete God in humanity.</P><P>In the conception of Christ, there were two essences&#151;the essence of God and the essence of man. On one hand, Christ was conceived of the Triune God. This involves the essence of God. On the other hand, He was born of a human virgin. This involves the essence of man. Hence, Christ is constituted of the essence of God and the essence of man. Among mankind there has been no other one like this. Only Christ was conceived of God in humanity.</P>
