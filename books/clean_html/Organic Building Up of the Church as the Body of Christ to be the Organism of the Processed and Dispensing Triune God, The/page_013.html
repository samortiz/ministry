<h2 class="head2">By the Head-given Gifts&mdash;<br />
the Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, and<br />
Shepherds and Teachers&mdash;Perfecting the Saints</h2>
<p>The intrinsic building up of the church is by the Head-given gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;perfecting the saints (Eph. 4:11-12). These are particular gifts such as Paul, Peter, Martin Luther, John Nelson Darby, and so forth. These Head-given gifts perfect the saints in the local churches (1 Cor. 12:28; Acts 13:1). When they are perfecting in the meetings, they are watering the members of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 3:6b). If we come to these meetings, we will receive much watering.</p>
<p>The perfecting of the saints by the gifts is unto the work of the ministry&mdash;the building up of the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). This perfecting should go on and on until all the members of Christ arrive at three things: at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). The oneness of the faith does not refer to our believing action, but to what we believe in. It is the objective faith which is the entire contents of the New Testament. The entire teaching of the New Testament is what we believe, so this New Testament teaching is our Christian faith, our Christian belief.</p>
<p>If we are still babyish, we may be holding on to different opinions from our background which cause us to lose the oneness of the faith (Eph. 4:14). If our background is Moslem, it may be hard for us to drop some of our Moslem philosophy. The Chinese may want to keep some thought from the teachings of Confucius. Those from a Catholic background may find it difficult to be freed of their idolatrous statues and pictures. One brother who had been newly saved went to help his mother to receive Christ. Pointing to a so-called picture of Jesus on the wall, she replied, &ldquo;I have had Christ on my wall for years.&rdquo; This is nothing more than a Catholic superstition. However, if one is babyish, he may not be able to drop the things of his background to keep the oneness of the faith. The different opinions that Christians hold may even cause them to fight.</p>
<p>In order to arrive at the oneness of the faith, we all need to grow. Our different opinions and different teachings, the winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14), are like toys. As we are growing, we will drop all the toys. The younger we are, the more we like toys. As a person over eighty years of age, I have no interest in any toy. The toys that we hold onto cause us to be dissenting with one another. We have to grow to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We need the proper realization of the New Testament faith. We also need the proper and adequate knowledge of Christ. The full knowledge of Christ, the Son of God, will save us from the toys.</p>
<p>We also need to arrive at a full-grown man. We may feel that we are far away from this point, but thank the Lord that we are growing. We are traveling on the way to arrive at a full-grown man. We also are on the way to arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). We grow until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the organic Body of Christ, which is the church. The living Body of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a measure. When we grow, the measure increases, and we are on our way to arriving at the stature of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through All the Perfected Members<br />
of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In order for the church to be built up intrinsically, the ascended Head must first give the gifts. Second, the Head-given gifts, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers, perfect the saints. Then the perfected saints build up the Body directly. Some have taken the Lord&rsquo;s promise in Matthew 16&mdash;&ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo;&mdash;to say that it is not we who build the church, but Christ. They say that we are not qualified to build up the church. This concept and teaching is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Matthew 16 is not the only chapter in the Bible. The Bible also includes Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4 reveals that the Head, Christ, builds up the church by making the saints gifts, and by giving these gifts to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ. This shows that the Head does not build up the church directly. Furthermore, the gifted persons, who are used by the Head to perfect others, do not build up the church directly either. They perfect the saints, and the saints do the direct building work. Many of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery who have been under the watering, the perfecting, for a number of years have been enabled to build up the church in our locality directly. The perfected saints are the direct builders of the church.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:14 Paul expresses his desire that the saints would be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching. If we remain as babes, we cannot bear any responsibility. We can only burden others. Whether or not we are babes will be tested. The tests will come in the form of storms. The storms have winds and waves. Are we being tossed by waves and carried about by the winds of teaching? If we are being tossed and carried about, we are babes. If we are not tossed and carried about, we are no longer babes.</p>
<p>The babes are carried about by every wind of teaching &ldquo;in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; Actually, craftiness is sleight. The word in Greek for &ldquo;sleight&rdquo; signifies the cheating of dice players. This craftiness is with a view to a system of error. Both sleight and craftiness are related to man, but the system of error is related to Satan. This system is not a human system, but a satanic system. Satan has made a system of all the winds of teaching to catch the babes, to distract the younger ones away from the practical oneness of the Body and the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>Rather than being babes, we must be those holding to truth in love to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (Eph. 4:15). Holding to truth means holding to what is real. According to the entire book of Ephesians, the real things in the universe are Christ as the Head and the church as His Body. We have to hold to these two things in love that we may grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. To grow up into Christ in all things is to build up. The growing up is the building up.</p>
<p>We grow up into Christ, the Head, and then something issues out from Christ, the Head. &ldquo;Into Christ&rdquo; is for our growth. &ldquo;Out from Christ&rdquo; is for our function, our usefulness. On the one hand, we are growing up into Christ. On the other hand, what we do is out from Him as the source for our function, our usefulness.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The Body is joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply. These are the gifted persons such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. Our physical body has many joints. We need many joints in the local churches. If we do not grow up into Christ, He has no way to make us a joint. In order to become a joint, we need to pray more, seek the Lord more, read the Bible more, feed on Christ more, etc. Everything with us related to Christ and the church should be &ldquo;more.&rdquo; We would have morning watch more. Some may have a five minute morning watch, but we would have a fifteen minute morning watch. With this kind of exercise over a period of time, we may become a joint in the Body.</p>
<p>In the Body, some are joints, like the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Others are parts who operate according to their measure. Through these two categories of members, the Body grows, and this growth is unto the building up of itself in love. If we are not a joint, we must be a part. None of us can escape from being either a joint or a part. We should not think that only the joints are useful. Every part in the Body is also useful. The thighs in our physical body are not joints, but they are great parts. We need our thighs to stand because they bear our weight. No member of the Body of Christ should despise himself. We all should praise the Lord that we are either joints or parts in the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If you are a joint, you should supply the Body with the riches of Christ. Through your contact with the Lord, you have become a joint, so you have the riches of Christ with which you can supply the Body. If you are a part, you should operate. The Body is supplied by the joints and enjoys the operation in measure of each one part for its growth. Through the joints supplying and the parts operating, all the Body causes the growth of the Body, and the growth of the Body results in the building up of itself in love.</p>
