   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE SEEING THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND PRACTICING IT Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 4:11-16; 1 Cor 14:26</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning how we should go on according to our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see the vision of the Lord's present recovery and put this vision into our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE GIFTS IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible presents us with a clear picture of God's desire for the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23a , the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus told us that He would build His church upon the divine revelation of Himself as the Christ Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not, however, build up His church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to build His church, He first accomplished His full redemption from His incarnation through His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His ascension He poured Himself out upon God's chosen ones to make them His Body Acts 2:2-4, 16-17a; 10:45; 1 Cor 12:13 , and He constituted some of His members as particular gifts for the building up of this Body Eph 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His ascension He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are the particular gifts which are considered as the joints of the supply in Ephesians 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The article "the" in this verse is emphatic and indicates a particular and rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the New Testament revelation, this particular, rich supply is the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The riches of Christ are the rich supply for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These particular riches of the rich Christ are being distributed to His entire Body by the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be clear about these four categories of particular members who are the joints of the Body of Christ: the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The written record of the New Testament was completed by the end of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the first century the church did have these four categories of joints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some have even called the first century the age of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who think this way have a mistaken concept.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we say that the first century was the age of the apostles, this implies strongly that after the first century, there are no more apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John Nelson Darby was one who taught that there were no more apostles after the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, however, we have to see and admit that there have been these four categories of gifted persons throughout the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There have been evangelists such as C. H. Spurgeon in England and D. L. Moody and Charles Finney in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There have also been many shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A pastor is another term for a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early part of the nineteenth century, many great teachers were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They opened up the Bible to a greater extent than it had ever been opened before since the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to church history, there have also been a number of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>William Carey went to India and brought the Lord's name, the gospel, and the Bible there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Surely he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hudson Taylor was sent by the Lord to China, and David Livingstone went to Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These brothers were also apostles.</S>
