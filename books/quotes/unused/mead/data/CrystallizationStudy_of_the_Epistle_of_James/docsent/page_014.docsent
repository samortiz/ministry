   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GENUINE CHRISTIAN PERFECTION REVEALED IN THE ENTIRE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen the virtues of Christian perfection stressed by James.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to see the genuine Christian perfection revealed in the entire divine revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a vast difference between these two kinds of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same subject of mathematics may be taught to both elementary students and college graduate students.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the subject is the same, the lessons are vastly different.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen the elementary school of Christian perfection in James.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we come to the graduate school of Christian perfection in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The New Testament is of twenty-seven books.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James is only one of the twenty-seven and is only five chapters long.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a short single book, James cannot compare with the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The perfection stressed by James is according to James's view.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the genuine Christian perfection is according to the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. The Factors of Which the Genuine Christian Perfection Christian Living Is Brought Forth 1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Processed and Consummated Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we want to see the factors which bring forth, or produce, the genuine Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first factor is the processed and consummated Triune God Matt 28:19; John 14:8-11, 16-20; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Triune God passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, the all-terminating death, the germinating resurrection, and the transcending ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many in Christianity teach that God never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that God never changes in His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He never changes in His love, in His holiness, etc., but He did have a big change in His person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a big change!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was God conceived in the womb of a virgin for nine months and born out of her to be a man, and that man was called Emmanuel, God with us Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 9:6 reveals that the little babe Jesus in the manger was the mighty God, the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you say that God never changes, you either do not know or do not believe the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible says that God changed, but in His Godhead He never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Triune God was processed and consummated in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The processed and consummated Triune God is the first factor for our Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The All-inclusive Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second factor is the all-inclusive Christ Eph 1:23; 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The all-inclusive Christ is a term invented by us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I started my ministry in December 1962 in the United States, and the first set of messages I gave was on the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That book on the all-inclusive Christ is based upon only three verses in Deuteronomy 8:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since that time, I have spoken concerning the all-inclusive Christ in thousands of messages.</S>
