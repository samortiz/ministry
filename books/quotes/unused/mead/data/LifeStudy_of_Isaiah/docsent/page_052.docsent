   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in the following verses Jehovah says, "For in a very little while My indignation will be completed, and My anger will be turned toward their destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And against them Jehovah of hosts will rouse up a whip like the stroke against Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt.</S>
