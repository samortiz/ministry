<h2 class="head1">THE STAGES OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Since October of 1984 the Lord has started a new way among us for the carrying out of His recovery. The recovery has been on the earth for over sixty years. In the first twenty years or more we have gone through at least two or three stages, so our practice has changed at least two or three times. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s writings, especially <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em>there are indications that the practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery did change. By 1937 Brother Nee had seen the principle or line of Antioch. Based upon this he gave the messages contained in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em>He said that up to that time the practice among us was only according to one way. He admitted that before that time he had not seen the line of Antioch. Until then most of the co-workers stayed in one place, not going out to spread the gospel to establish the churches. In those messages he charged us all not to stay permanently in one place, but to go out from one city to another. He called this the line of Antioch. Since 1937 there was a change in the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. From 1937 to 1942 we practiced the line of Antioch.</p>
<p>In 1942 there was a turmoil in Shanghai. This was a real hardship to Brother Nee, and he spontaneously stopped his ministry until 1948. In those six years he did not minister as usual; he only did a small amount in the interior of China during the war time. While Brother Nee was there in the interior caring for his pharmaceutical factory, he gave the messages contained in <em>The Orthodoxy of the Church.</em> That was all that he ministered. Besides this he occasionally gave time to some of the seekers to fellowship with him.</p>
<p>After the war he came back to Shanghai, and I also was invited to stay there. We began to come together, even though he would not come to the meetings. We had much time together to talk about the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. He began to let me know privately that he saw something further, which he called the line of Jerusalem. Due to the revival in Shanghai and other cities, Brother Nee was brought back to his ministry. At that time he gave us at least one message on the line of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Since 1948 we practiced very much according to the second line, the line of Jerusalem, mainly to have the co-workers stay in the major cities to help the building up of the local churches as strong testimonies there. We practiced this way for quite a number of years. This practice was even brought over to Taiwan and somewhat to the United States. By this you could see that in the past years we practiced the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in three stages, the initial stage, the second stage of the Antioch line, and the third stage of the Jerusalem line until 1984.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT SITUATION OF OLDNESS</h2>
<p>In the last years, especially from 1980, I began to realize that we have somewhat become dull, without much sense of the spiritual situation and condition among us. For years we simply went according to what we had seen through Brother Nee. We had no intention to question whether we should still continue in that way or not. We did not realize how old and how cold we were and how much we were retained in our old practice. This practice was new in 1948 but since 1980 has become no longer new. With the practice according to the vision we had received through Brother Nee concerning the line of Jerusalem, we brought the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to this country in 1962. In the first ten years the recovery was new and living. It was not as cold and old as it has been in the last seven or eight years.</p>
<p>This cold and old situation and condition was more serious in Taiwan than in the United States. Taiwan&rsquo;s situation in 1984 was the primary factor that caused me to reconsider our way. In the five years since 1980, whenever the leading ones came to this country to meet with me, I always charged them seriously and thoroughly, even warning them, that the work there could not go on in this way. However, within these five years of charging, warning, and exhorting, there was very little change or advancement.</p>
<p>During those years I had to spend about ninety days to prepare for the summer training and another ninety days to prepare for the winter training, mainly in the writing of the notes. Even while I was so busy, I was considering Taiwan very much because it is the source of the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China. Because there was a new start there in 1949, I considered that as a great part of the produce of my ministry. Therefore, I was very much concerned for the situation. I realized that if Taiwan would be like that, they would be a spring full of sulfur. The churches elsewhere would not be able to receive the current from Taiwan without the taste of sulfur.</p>
<p>In order to purify the current of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery around the globe, I had to purify that spring as the source. I made this decision after a long period of consideration. During those five years while I was advising and exhorting the leading ones there to improve the work, I was already considering to go back to do something. I was not able to be spared, however, in order that I could finish the Life-study of the New Testament. After the last word of the notes on the New Testament was written, I felt that this was the time. I had to go back to Taiwan. At the end of September of 1984 I finished the writing, and in October I went back. I indicated that I would stay a longer time there and that I probably would go back quite often.</p>
<p>Something stirred up within my spirit telling me that I had to revolutionize the church life, not leaving a bit of the old practice. The entire practice had to be overturned. It was too old. Perhaps thirty years ago it was good. This can be compared to our means of transportation. In 1947 I flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on a DC-4, which was called the King in the Air. It seemed so pleasant and comfortable. Again in 1958 I flew from Taiwan to San Francisco on a DC-4. It was marvelous to us that we could cross the entire Pacific and arrive at San Francisco within twenty-four hours. However, today we may travel to Taiwan in twelve hours. It is much more comfortable; I could even walk and exercise on that 747. What an improvement! No one can change the earth created by God, but surely we can improve the transportation around it. Throughout the centuries there have been many improvements in transportation. In previous centuries travel by wagon from the east coast to the west coast may have taken about one hundred days. But today to fly from the west coast to New York takes a little over five hours. This is due to the changes, the improvements in the methods of travel.</p>
<p>Why in working for the Lord would we remain in the oldness? This is the way of the Catholic Church; the ordinances of the Catholic Church have existed for over fourteen centuries since the establishment of the papal system. There has hardly been any change. It is somewhat the same with us. By remaining in the old way we surely have suffered. We suffered firstly in the growth of life. We suffered as well in the matter of the truth, and we suffered the most in the loss of the increase. In the last five years we have not had much increase. It is the same in all the churches. Only a few places are better. We generally remained the same. This is a great loss. However, within the last ten years other groups have risen up in the United States. In the Far East in at least three or more places some Christian groups increased from one thousand to a hundred thousand. In 1958, the same year the church in Taipei began to drop the small group meetings, a church in Seoul, Korea started. It started simply with the pastor, his wife, and two other couples. Now they claim to have a few hundred thousand members in that one city. When I began to study their situation in October of 1984, they claimed they had 300,000. Today they claim they have more. Another little group in Singapore was started by a student who returned from the United States within the last ten years. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day they have several sessions in one rented auditorium. Quite a few thousand rotate to meet there, session after session.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
