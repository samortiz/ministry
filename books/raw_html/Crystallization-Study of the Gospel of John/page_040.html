<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Enjoyment for Satisfaction</H2><P>This is the enjoyment for satisfaction in drinking the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. The New Jerusalem Being Called the Tabernacle</H2><P>Hence, the New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle, indicating that those who participate in the New Jerusalem are the real keepers of the Feast of Tabernacles for eternity with full enjoyment and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Thought of Remembrance</H2><P>The word Tabernacles in the title of the Feast of Tabernacles implies the thought of remembrance, that is, the Israelite keepers of the Feast of Tabernacles should remember that their forefathers dwelt in tents (tabernacles) in their wandering in the wilderness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. The New Jerusalem<br>Being Called the Tabernacle of God<br>for the Remembrance of the Overcomers</H2><P>Similarly, even the New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:2-3) for the remembrance of the overcomers, who dwelt also in tents, in the first stage of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. The New Jerusalem Being Consummated</H2><P>The New Jerusalem will be consummated firstly to be the firstfruits in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the overcomers and then consummated lastly to be in the new heaven and new earth as the full enjoyment of God's full salvation to all the perfected believers. This will be the real Feast of Tabernacles.</P>
