THE TEST OF OUR SPIRITUALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Genuine Spirituality Being for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>In addition to seeing the vision of God&rsquo;s building, we also need to see what the building is in practicality. The building is the test of every kind of spirituality. We ourselves are not the standard by which our spirituality is tested for its genuineness. Rather, we must put our spirituality on the doorstep of the building to be tested. You may be very spiritual, but you may be too individualistic. The individualistic spirituality is not the genuine one. The genuine, real spirituality must be for the building. If someone considers that he is spiritual, yet he is independent, individualistic, and isolated from the Body, his spirituality is a deception.</p>
<p>Someone may be very humble, but whether this humility is genuine and spiritual or false and natural can be tested only by the building. There are many humble persons, but they are too independent. They are not related to anyone. They are individualistically humble, humble in an isolated way. We may have nice, good, and humble brothers of this kind among us, and we may all appreciate such persons. However, if we have a vision &ldquo;from a mountaintop,&rdquo; we can look down and see the actual situation. Let us tear down this kind of natural humility. It is too individualistic and isolated, and it even damages. There is no relatedness with this kind of humility. True and genuine spirituality is for the building. If we can have the building up, then to be proud or humble does not matter. We do not want to be praised by others for our humility yet damage the building with it.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s concern, what matters is not our spirituality. Strictly speaking, God is concerned not for spirituality but for the building. Regardless of how good, humble, and spiritual we consider ourselves to be, let us be tested. How much are we in the building? How much are we built up and related with others? God&rsquo;s aim is not to have a group of nice Christians. His aim is to build us up together. He does not want precious stones in a museum for an exhibition. He wants to have a house built up with the precious materials. You may be precious, but you are still not built up with others. If this is the case, you are good only for an exhibition; you are not good for the building. God made the precious materials for the building, not for an individualistic display.</p>
<p>In a certain place some saints recommended a sister, saying, &ldquo;She is so spiritual. She is quiet and always so nice to everyone.&rdquo; In actuality, this sister was nice to everyone, but she was not nice for God&rsquo;s building. She had been in that city for many years without being related to anyone. She was considered very spiritual, but she was not connected. She was nice in an isolated, individualistically spiritual way that was not for the building up of the Body. We must not appreciate this kind of spirituality. The test of our spirituality is the building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Applying the Test of the Building<br />
to Solve All the Problems<br />
and Answer All the Questions</h2>
<p>In a certain place there were two parties of brothers who were dissenting and fighting with one another. Eventually both parties came to me, wanting to see which side was right and which was wrong. After I listened to both groups for a long time, they said, &ldquo;We know that you will not take sides, but we still wish to know how you feel. If you say we are right, we will receive your word, and if you say we are wrong, we will receive that also.&rdquo; At that time I did not check to see who was right and who was wrong, as if by using the law of Moses. Rather, I applied the test of the building. I checked with them, saying, &ldquo;Brothers, please consider how much you are in the building. Is what you are doing here good for the building? Is it a gain for the building, or is it a loss? Does it help the building, or does it frustrate it? You may be entirely right, but you are still a hindrance, a frustration, to the building.&rdquo; Then some of them prayed with tears: &ldquo;O Lord, forgive us. We felt that what we were doing was right, even according to the Word, but we have been damaging the building.&rdquo; Then the other brothers said, &ldquo;We are clear now. We too have been damaging the Body.&rdquo; On that day many brothers became clear, not by checking with the law of Moses but by the test of the building. They wept, prayed, and repented to the Lord, asking Him to forgive and deliver them. From that time onward, no one among those brothers spoke of who was right and who was wrong. They realized that it is not a matter of right and wrong but of whether or not we are built up together.</p>
<p>Today is not the day of the law. Today is the day of the building up of the Body. What God is seeking after today is not that we keep the requirements of the law but that we fulfill the requirements of the building. We must be built up. This is the real test of our spirituality. Even if we feel that we have not seen the vision, we should still put ourselves and specific things about us on the test of the building. If we do this, we will see the difference.</p>
<p>It is difficult for someone to be truly related with others if, for example, he has secret, unconfessed sins and inner, hidden things. As long as we have something that condemns our conscience, we cannot be built up with others. In order to see things properly and rightly, we need to have the right standing, the right angle. Without the test of the building we may have a certain angle, but if we apply the test of the building to many matters, our point of view will be completely turned around. We will see things from a different viewpoint. Then as long as our point of view is changed, our problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Today is not the day of the law or of spirituality. This is the age for God&rsquo;s building. The building of God is our standard and test. We need to test ourselves not concerning right or wrong but by how much we have been built up. This is the test, and it is also the solution for all of our problems and the answer to all of our questions. How much have we been related to our dear brothers and sisters? How much are we one with them in the spirit in love, life, and reality? Satan hates this oneness and harmony. He endeavors to do whatever he can to damage the oneness. Once we lose this oneness, we lose our impact. Our impact is in the oneness of the building. When we are truly one, in harmony, and built up together as one Body, we have a real impact.</p>
<p>We need to see the vision of God&rsquo;s building, and we need to test our life, work, move, motive, intention, desire, and point of view by the building up of the Body. If we apply the building as the test, we will be fully and thoroughly revolutionized, and we will have a real turn.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
