These messages were published in Chinese in 1955 by the Taiwan Gospel Book Room under the title, The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Volume 35 is a translation of this Chinese publication.</p><p>Notes from this same series were later used as the basis for another book, Changed into His Likeness, which was published in English in 1967 by Christian Literature Crusade. Since the contents of the two books are essentially the same, we have not included Changed into His Likeness in The Collected Works.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
