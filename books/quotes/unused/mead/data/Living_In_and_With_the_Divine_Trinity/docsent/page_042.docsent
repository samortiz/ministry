   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Justified through the Redemption of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this sanctifying work, we were justified through the redemption of Christ Acts 13:39; Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After repenting, we did not know much about Christ, but we began to treasure Him, to appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We began to have a good feeling about Him, even though no one had said much about Him to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We had such an inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Spontaneously some of us might have said, "I love Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus is very good."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a sign that we have believed in Him and that He has redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God the Father justified us, and this justification implies reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It also implies God's willing acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been brought into peace with our God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our sins have been forgiven, and all our sinfulness has been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have been forgiven, washed, reconciled, justified, and accepted through Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Born of God through the Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Spirit with the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were also born of God through the regeneration of the Spirit with the divine life John 1:12-13; 3:6b, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following God's forgiveness, God's washing, God's reconciliation, God's justification, and God's willing acceptance of us through Jesus' redemption, the Holy Spirit enlivened our dead spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sealed with the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, we were sealed with the Spirit Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit was put upon us as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was our initial experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can even say that this was our enrollment into the experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>LIVING IN THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ABIDING IN CHRIST AS THE TRUE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we want to see what it means to live in the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Outside of the divine revelation of the Bible, there is no religion or philosophy that says that we can live in another person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Bible reveals that we can live in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a wonder and an honor it is to be those who can live in the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live in the Triune God is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the entire universe there is such a miracle that we can live in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To live in the Divine Trinity is to abide in Christ as the true vine John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ likened Himself to a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The illustration of a vine tree gives us the proper understanding of what it means to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The branches are abiding in the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that the branches are living in the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To live in the Triune God is just like the branches abiding in a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is wonderful that Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus is not a pine tree but a vine tree spreading and growing over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His fruit is so available to us because He is the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This vine tree has many branches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the branches are the completion of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without its branches, a vine tree would not be a complete tree.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This tree with all its branches is an organism to express its inner life and to fulfill its purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God with His divine life needs some expression, and He has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because of this He needs an organism to express His life and to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is this organism, the vine tree, and now we are abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Greek word for "abide" means not only to remain or to stay but also to have your home, or to make your home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In John 14 the same word is used as a noun.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord told us that in His Father's house there were many abodes v. 2 and that He would come to make an abode with His lovers v. 23 . An abode is a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, to abide is to dwell in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To live in Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God means that we take Christ as our dwelling place for our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as the branches abide in the tree, they have their daily life in the tree because they are living there.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we should understand the real denotation of living in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To live in the Triune God is to have Him as our dwelling place, as our home, for our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The vine tree with its branches is the very organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, to live in the Triune God is to abide in Christ as God's organism.</S>
