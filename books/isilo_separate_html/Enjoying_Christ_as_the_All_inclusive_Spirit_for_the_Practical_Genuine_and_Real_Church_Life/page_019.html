OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The New Creation Having the Divine Life<br />
and Nature as Its Constitution</h2>
<p>In 5:6 Paul says, &ldquo;In Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love.&rdquo; Then again in 6:15 he says, &ldquo;Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.&rdquo; The book of Galatians concludes with the new creation, which is the issue of all the things dealt with in chapters 1 through 6. The new creation is the new man in Christ, which corporately is Christ&rsquo;s Body, the church (Eph. 4:24; 2:15-16; Col. 3:10-11). God has two creations, the old creation and the new creation. The old creation is God&rsquo;s work, but it does not have God&rsquo;s life and nature in it. God was among His old creation, but He did not enter into it. The new creation, however, has God within it. God as the basic element of the new creation has been wrought into it. The old creation is composed of the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, including man. Strictly speaking, the new creation, does not include all these items; it is simply the church as the new man. In the future we will have the new heavens and the new earth, but even the new heavens and earth will not have the divine nature in them. They will be restored, but they will not be renewed with the divine element. Only the church has God as the basic element in it. This is signified by the golden lampstands, which are a sign of the churches and which consummate in the New Jerusalem as the city of gold (Rev. 1:12, 20; 21:18, 21). In typology gold signifies divinity. The new heaven and the new earth will not have the element of divinity, but the New Jerusalem&mdash;the ultimate expression, manifestation, and consummation of the church as the new man&mdash;will be constituted with the divine life and nature. Today every local church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem, having God Himself as its basic element. No human words can exhaust what the new creation is. Nevertheless, we are in it, and we are a part of it. We are not merely what we were created as in the old creation; we are a part of the new creation, having the divine life and nature as our constitution.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dropping the Ordinances<br />
to Have the New Man in Practicality</h2>
<p>Paul says that neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision. This means that to have a traditional religious practice is nothing, and to reject that practice is also nothing in itself. Likewise, to shout in the meetings is nothing in itself, and to be silent is also nothing; both to keep religious forms and to drop all the forms are nothing. Rather, a new creation is what matters. This is why we do not care for the law, religion, traditions, ordinances, or the flesh. We care only for Christ as the life-giving Spirit filling our spirit. If Christianity were to drop its ordinances, it may have very little left. The reason that Christianity maintains its ordinances is to make people appear to be living, even if they are dead (Rev. 3:1). This is to cheat people. Some claim that certain practices in Christianity, such as the clergy-laity system, choirs, and Sunday schools are necessary. These things may be necessary for Christianity, but they are not necessary for the church. Outward forms and ordinances are necessary only for the dead ones, not for the living ones.</p>
<p>The new creation is the new man. Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus abolished all the ordinances in order to bring together the two peoples&mdash;the Jews and the Gentiles&mdash;to create the church as the one new man. Although the Lord slew all the ordinances and buried them in a tomb, Christianity has opened the tomb to attempt to bring them back. As a result, the unique new man that the Lord created has now been divided. Christianity is divided mainly by ordinances, such as the various methods of baptism. The New Testament teaches us that we must baptize people, but the Lord has no intention that we make baptism an ordinance. In this matter alone there are many different ordinances. To baptize by immersion is an ordinance to some, and baptizing by sprinkling is an ordinance to others. Moreover, the number of times to immerse someone, the direction in which to immerse them, and the kind of water to immerse them in are more ordinances. If we testify to someone that we are saved and that we love the Lord Jesus, he may simply ask where we were baptized, believing that baptism only according to his ordinance is able to cause people to be saved. Many divisions have been produced over this issue alone.</p>
<p>Methods of studying the Bible, practicing the gifts, and conducting our meetings can all become ordinances. We must never let our practices become ordinances. If a good practice becomes an ordinance, we should be the first ones to drop it. If we have the assurance that we are practicing something in the spirit, it is good to do it, but if we are not in the spirit, we should stop. Galatians 5:13 says, &ldquo;You were called for freedom, brothers; only do not turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.&rdquo; Our freedom in Christ is precious, but we should not take advantage of and abuse this freedom. When we practice something in our meetings, we must be sure that we do it in the spirit. This all depends on our daily living. Day by day and hour by hour we must be one with the dear Lord Jesus. We should always say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. I am one with You. I do not care for my desires, feelings, wishes, tendencies, intentions, likes, or dislikes. I do not care for myself. Lord Jesus, I care only for You. You are the living Spirit who lives in me, and I am one with You.&rdquo; If we do this, we will come to the meetings with the rich experiences of Christ, and our spirit will be strong, high, and released. Then whatever we do in the meetings will minister Christ to the members of His Body. We will not hold to laws, ordinances, religion, traditions, or regulations. We will simply have the reality of the living Jesus, which is the reality of the new creation, the new man, the church life. In this reality there are no divisions, no confusion, no Greek, no Jew, no barbarian, no Scythian, no bond man, and no free man. Rather, Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). This kind of church life is the very thing that the Lord is recovering today.</p>
<p>We must all ask the Lord to have mercy upon us. According to our natural birth, we are all religious. The element and disposition of religion are in our blood, but they have already been put on the cross. Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit living in our spirit is now our new source, new nature, and new life. Therefore, we must walk by the Spirit, sow to the Spirit, and enjoy all the riches of the all-inclusive Christ in our spirit. For this reason, Paul concludes Galatians by saying, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen&rdquo; (6:18). We need to digest and assimilate all the matters that we have fellowshipped in this series of messages in order to make them our living. Then we will enjoy the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, not merely in a doctrinal way but richly, in practicality and actuality. This depends on our faithfulness to go on with the Lord in our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
