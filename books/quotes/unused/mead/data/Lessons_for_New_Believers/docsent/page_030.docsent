   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAISING IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The emphasis in giving thanks is to thank God for His grace, and the emphasis in praising is to praise God for His acts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through prayer, we not only touch God s grace but also witness God s acts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s grace requires thanksgiving, and His acts require praises.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can praise by saying, Lord, I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are the wonderful Lord who does wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even as I tell You of my difficulties, I sense that You have already taken care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your promise is sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With respect to the grace of God, we need to give thanks, and with respect to the acts of God, we need to offer praises.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WORSHIPPING IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There should also be worship in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Worship is toward God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should thank God for His grace, praise Him for His acts, and simply worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each prayer that is heard and fulfilled enables us to experience God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Experiencing God issues in worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible shows that worship of God is derived from man s experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best and the most evident worship of God was rendered by Jacob as he was dying, leaning on his staff.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jacob s staff was the symbol of his sojourning on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of his many experiences of God, he was able to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This also applies to our worship in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether our prayer is heard and fulfilled or has not yet been fulfilled, we touch God and gain knowledge of Him through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consequently, we should worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our prayer we should worship God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE CONTINUATION OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our time for prayer is over and our spirit is exhausted, but our burden related to a particular matter is not yet discharged, we should stop and wait for another time to continue praying for the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To pray for a certain matter again and again is the continuation of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes things are fulfilled as soon as we pray, but other matters require prayer over a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some matters require a year or years of prayer in order for them to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God often delights in the continuation of prayer in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Continuation of prayer can be compared to placing cards on one side of a scale.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Each prayer is like the addition of a card.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should continue to pray until there is enough weight to tip the scale.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the continuation of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE COMPLEMENT TO PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The complement to prayer is reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Reading the Bible and praying complement each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Good Bible reading needs to be complemented with prayer, and good prayer needs to be complemented with Bible reading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is what we call reading and praying, praying and reading.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two matters should be mingled so that we cannot distinguish reading from praying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Reading the Bible helps our praying, and praying helps our reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This may be compared to our left and right arms.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy for us to lose our balance if either arm is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Prayer without reading the Bible makes it difficult for our spirit of prayer to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we need to read a portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An appropriate amount of Bible reading can usually uplift, cultivate, and nourish our spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we need to train ourselves to complement our prayer with the reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE TIME TO PRAY A Set Time</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should all have a set time each day to read the Bible and also a set time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should pray in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead of praying at irregular times, we should decide on definite times for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not set aside definite times, we will lose the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are experienced realize that in order to redeem the time, we must set aside the time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only time that has been set aside can be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This applies even more to times for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not set a time for prayer, we will not pray regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, to have a proper spiritual exercise, we need to set a time to rise up in the morning, a time to read the Bible, and a time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Morning</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Just as with Bible reading, the best time to pray is in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since our heart and spirit are not yet distracted or troubled by many things in the morning, they are able to be quiet before God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is also easy for our spirit to open to God and be touched in our fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, there are fewer distractions in the morning, unlike other times of the day when the telephone or the doorbell rings, the neighbor visits, or troubling and trivial matters arise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The best time for us to pray in a peaceful environment before God is in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Praying at Other Times</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Psalm 119:164 David said that he praised Jehovah seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Psalm 55:17 he said that he prayed to God in the evening, in the morning, and at noon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When Daniel was in captivity in Babylon, he knelt down before God to pray three times a day Dan 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Besides praying in the morning, we should also pray at other times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not Being Too Long</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is sufficient for the duration of each prayer time to be twenty to thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Prayer time that is too long often results in a loss of interest, exhaustion, and hesitancy to pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Unless there is a special burden, our prayer times do not need to be very long.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>COMPANIONS IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to have a good prayer life, we should also find companions to pray with.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This will cause our prayer to be strengthened and also help us to maintain a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For many Christians, it is not easy to pray unless they pray with others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is especially difficult for those who have a wandering mind to be calm in order to pray alone.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If they can pray with two or three others, it is easier for their mind to concentrate and be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this way they can pray for a longer period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we always pray alone, our learning in prayer will surely be inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If several people pray together, there will be more learning in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul exhorted Timothy to pursue with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is best if every brother and sister would spend some time praying with others, apart from their own individual prayer time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christians should also attend prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There are many lessons on prayer that can be learned in prayer meetings.</S>
