   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. TOGETHER WITH CHRIST, DEALING WITH THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another issue of one who is full of the stature of Christ is that of dealing, together with Christ, with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To deal with the enemy is to fight the warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we should not use the term "warfare" here, because it does not convey the meaning of full maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are really full of the stature of Christ and our life has attained unto full maturity, our spiritual warfare is over.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we are seated far above all in a victorious position and need only to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was in the same process that the Lord Jesus fought the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the time of His temptation at the beginning of His ministry, He continually fought with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when He ascended to the throne, He ceased fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, He continues to deal with the enemy, until eventually he will be subdued beneath His feet and become His footstool Heb 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we attain to the stage of dealing, together with Christ, with the enemy, it is proof that our life has attained to its highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For a victorious one, there is no need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All he needs to do is to be situated in a certain place; then all the robbers and prowlers will disappear completely, daring no more to act foolishly or do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His awe-inspiring reputation has been gained through much warfare in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This example explains the principle of Christ in dealing with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If neither Christ nor His name were in this universe today, imagine how much more violent Satan would be!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is simply because Christ is dealing with the enemy today that wherever the name of Christ is lifted up, the enemy flees and the power of darkness vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes we see the same condition in the church or in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as there are one or more who have a deeper life, trouble can hardly arise in the church or in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once those persons leave, however, many problems arise.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because they are in authority dealing, together with Christ, with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their presence there subdues the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is as if there were no need for dealing, but in reality their presence is the dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, dealing with the enemy is superior to fighting the warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the life of a Christian reaches this stage, every part of his being comes to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is waiting to be raptured to enter into glory with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible uses the reaping of the harvest to illustrate the rapture of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the harvest is ripe, it is ready to be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we should not view the matter of rapture merely as prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rapture is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the life of the church or the life of the saints grows and matures continuously in Christ, at a certain stage it becomes fully ripened and, in the sight of the Lord, is ready to be reaped from the field of the world into the barn of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This occurs at the time of the Lord's return, the time of the rapture of the church Rev 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are raptured, we will be brought by the Lord into His glory to enjoy the glory with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the purpose of God's salvation is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when the life experience of a Christian attains to the full stature of Christ, it has reached the climax.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He shares the same position with Christ, and he reigns and deals with the enemy together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His whole being is filled with the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Aside from the fact that the body has not yet been transfigured into the body of glory, all else has reached its highest or final point.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The life experience of a saint in Christ thus comes to a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Other than waiting to be raptured and entering into glory, there is nothing else left to be desired.</S>
