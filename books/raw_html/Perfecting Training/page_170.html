 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TRIUNE GOD AND<br />
OUR REGENERATED HUMAN SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In Romans 8 there are eleven positive items which may be considered as the components of the spiritual leading. When we experience these eleven items, we are sons of God led by the Spirit of God. Actually these eleven items may be divided into three groups of three items each plus two other items. The first group is the group of the law which is composed of the law, the Spirit, and life (v. 2).</p>
<p>The second group is the group of our regenerated and mingled spirit. This group contains the human spirit, the things of the Spirit, and the mind set on the spirit (vv. 4-6).</p>
<p>The third group is the group of the Trinity. The Spirit of God no doubt refers to the Spirit of the Father (v. 9). The Spirit of Christ, of course, refers to the Spirit of the Son (v. 9). The Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead should be the Spirit in the Godhead (v. 11).</p>
<p>So there are three groups: the group of the law, the group of the mingled spirit, and the group of the Trinity. If we live by these three groups we have a tenth item, peace (v. 6). Peace is a condition we have by living in such a way. There is also a result, the sons of God (v. 14). The condition of such a living is peace, and the result is the sons of God.</p>
<p>Actually these eleven items do not refer to a very complicated, confused, and mixed-up situation. Rather, they reveal to us a simple life. Life is always simple. When you study it, it seems complicated, but when you live it, it is so simple. To understand our physical body is very complicated, but simply to live in our physical body is so simple. Even little children who don&rsquo;t know very much can live quite well.</p>
<p>Romans 8 is a thorough study of our spiritual life. No other chapter in the New Testament reveals the spiritual life so much in detail as Romans 8. The spiritual life is just a life filled with the Triune God. In Romans 8 the Triune God is referred to repeatedly in different ways and in different manners. Even the law of the Spirit of life implies the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUP OF THE TRINITY</h2>
<p>In the last group, the group of the Trinity, the title, the Father, is not mentioned. But the Spirit is used three times: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead. This threefold mention of the Spirit surely indicates strongly the Trinity of the Triune God. Even in the sequence you can see the Trinity. Why is the Spirit of Christ not mentioned first? Why is it mentioned in the middle of the three? Firstly is the Spirit of God, referring to God the Father. Secondly is the Spirit of Christ, referring to Christ the Son, and thirdly is the Spirit of the One, referring to the Spirit of the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUP OF OUR MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Such a life filled with the Triune God is one that is lived through our human spirit. This brings us to the second group. The second group is the group of our mingled spirit. In this group there is our human spirit mingled with the life-giving Spirit. Our spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit. Then there are the things of the Spirit, that is, the mingled spirit. The things of the mingled spirit are the things of God. The mind set on the spirit is a mind which is minding Christ. Even in the Bible you have such a term as the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16). By this you could see that the Trinity is wrapped up with our mingled spirit. Our spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit. And the things of such a Spirit are the things of God the Father. The mind set on such a spirit is the mind of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENUINE AND PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>The spiritual life or the Christian life is just one filled with the Triune God, and it is one wrapped up with our human spirit. This kind of teaching is very subjective. It is just the believers and God living together. Romans 8:1-14 doesn&rsquo;t touch other items such as holiness or victory or humility or kindness. In a sense these are trivial matters in the spiritual field.</p>
<p>Rather, this chapter reveals to us that a genuine and proper Christian life is just one filled with the Triune God who is wrapped up with our regenerated spirit. If you take care of these two points you are under the leading by the Spirit. You know you are under the leading by the Spirit because you have peace. When you have a life filled with the Triune God who is wrapped up with your spirit, you have peace. Anytime and anywhere, under any kind of situation, you have peace. By this peace you know that you are living with the Triune God, and you are under the leading by the Spirit.</p>
