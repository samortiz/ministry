In this message we will see that this reaction issues in Israel's turn to Jehovah and their return to the Holy Land for restoration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. ISSUING IN ISRAEL'S TURN<br>TO JEHOVAH AND THEIR RETURN<br>TO THE HOLY LAND FOR RESTORATION</H2><P>The first issue of Jehovah's reaction is Israel's return to Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Israel's Turn to Jehovah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In Distress Seeking Jehovah</H2><P>In distress they sought Jehovah; they whispered out a prayer, for His chastening was upon them (26:16). As a pregnant woman draws near to giving birth, she writhes and cries out in her pain; so they have been before Jehovah (v. 17). Just as Israel turned to Jehovah after God's chastening, we need to repent and whisper out a prayer and have a talk with the Lord when we are suffering in our distress.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Saying That Jehovah Is Their God<br>and That They Will Exalt Him</H2><P>In 25:1, 4 and 5 we are told what Israel said in their prayer to Jehovah. Verse 1 says, "O Jehovah, You are my God; /I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name,/For You have done wonderful things&#151;/Counsels of old, in faithfulness, perfect faithfulness." In words that remind us of 4:6, verse 4 goes on to say, "For You have been a stronghold to the weak,/A stronghold to the needy in his distress,/A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat;/For the breath of those who terrify is like a tempest against a wall." Then verse 5 continues, "Like the heat in a drought,/You will subdue the uproar of strangers;/Like the heat through the shadow of a cloud,/The song of those who terrify will be brought low." Their haughtiness and even their singing will be subdued.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
