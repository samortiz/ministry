The first conference was held in February 1928 on the subject: 'God's Eternal Purpose and the Victory of Christ'
The third conference was held in January 1934 on the subjects: 'Christ as the Centrality and Universality of God' and 'God's Overcomers'
The fourth conference was held in October of the same year on the subjects: 'The Life of Abraham' and 'Spiritual Warfare'
Two of the outlines presented in Chapter 1 were published in more polished form later; thus, 'Ministering to the House or to God'?
Although these messages were not published in The Present Testimony we have included them here with the messages released during this period
The nature and burden of this conference can be found in Watchman Nee's note, 'A Letter Concerning the Third Overcomer Conference'
We have previously held two conferences of the same nature, one in February of 1928 and one in October of 1931
Many of the gospel messages, interpretations of prophecy, Bible expositions, and answers to questions are not God's center
If a person has not laid hold of God's center, all these truths will only be doctrines to him and will not give him any help
The Levites ministered to the house in the outer court; they killed the sacrifices before the people and ministered on their behalf
The sons of Zadok ministered to the Lord's table within the Holy Place and served the Lord by offering the fat and the blood
They like to help others move and kill the sacrifices, but they do not like to serve the Lord in the Holy Place
Many people like to run around in an outward way; they like to save sinners, edify the believers, and serve the brothers
It is possible to follow the Lord 'at a distance' , but it is not possible to minister to the Lord at a distance
The blood is there for the forgiveness of sins; it satisfies God's righteousness and holiness, and it enables us to come to God
We are very afraid of being in the sanctuary because if we remain in the sanctuary it is easy to be misunderstood, slandered, and criticized
Acts 13:1-3 tells us when 'they were ministering to the Lord and fasting,' the Holy Spirit sent them out on their missionary work abroad
Hebrews emphasizes two things: our ministering to God within the veil and our suffering the reproach of the Lord without the camp
After we have worked, we should not eat, drink, and enjoy; rather, we should say, 'We are unprofitable slaves'
Gird yourself and serve me' means that after one has worked, he should still be on the alert to minister to the Lord
The work in the field is not as good as the ministry in the house, and the field and the sheep are not as good as the Lord Himself
Some people are very willing at the beginning to give up everything to consecrate themselves fully to the Lord and to follow Him
When they encounter something along the way which is contrary to their will, they decide not to follow the Lord anymore
Many times we put ourselves in the Lord's hand, while at the same time we pray privately, 'Please do not break me'!
Those who have life in an outward way are like the plant stalk, but those with life in an inward way are like the roots
Those who have been dealt with by God in secret, who have deep roots, will overcome all affliction and persecution
He can ride on a colt that has never been sat on before, and he can deal with those who have never obeyed Him before
Although we are directed toward men and are for men's use, we are 'shut up,' and we wait for the Lord to open us and use us
At a Keswick Convention, one anonymous Christian said that all the failures of believers are from these two reasons
The only condition for God's blessing, spiritual growth, or the experience of the fullness of the Lord is to be empty
We have to constantly realize our own fullness, and we should also constantly empty ourselves of our own fullness
The order of the Holy Spirit's work in us is first to create a desire in our heart so that we become dissatisfied with our present life
God arranges the environment for us that we might know the Lord more, know ourselves more, and know the vanity of the self
Go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and each one you fill set aside
She went away from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons; and they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out into them
The fact is not that we cannot be filled, but that we do not have the empty spots for the Holy Spirit to work into
Through the Holy Spirit, God puts this desire in the hearts of His children so that they will know what is His heart's desire
For over twenty-five hundred years, God has not increased the number of the house of Israel because no one has inquired this of Him
The more thorough our prayers are, the more the will of God will be accomplished, and Satan's deceptions will not be able to come in
In our prayer we should pay attention to three things: to whom we are praying, for whom we are praying, and against whom we are praying
Why did God choose man, commission the prophets, send the Savior, give us the Holy Spirit, set up the church, and establish the kingdom?
When the Lord was born, an angel told Mary that He is the Son of God , but the angels told the shepherds that He is Christ the Lord
In eternity past, God ordained that there be a house and that the second person of the Godhead, the Son, rule over this house
The Father plans, the Son inherits what the Father planned, and the Spirit accomplishes what the Father planned
According to His eternal plan and before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son become flesh and accomplish redemption
God called us to partake of His Son that we would become like His Son and that His Son would be the Firstborn among many brothers
The reason God created man was that man would have the life of His Son and enter into glory with His Son, thus satisfying His Son's heart
Revelation 4 and 5 show the scene of the Lord's ascension into the heavens after His resurrection, in which He receives glory and praise
One day our bodies will be redeemed; we will receive full sonship and will enter into the freedom of the glory
We see that from eternity to eternity, all the things God has done are for His Son to have the first place in all things
What God planned before the foundation of the world is 'that He Himself might have the first place in all things'
Colossians 1 tells us these two things: Christ has the first place in all things, and Christ is the Head of the church
Revelation 4 and 5 also tell us these two things: chapter four speaks of creation, and chapter five speaks of redemption
Gods goal in creating all things and man is to have all things express Christ and to have man conformed to Christ having His life and glory
As a result, Christ's redemption must reconcile all things to God, and redeem fallen mankind and impart His life to them
To solve God's problems, Christ's redemption must also deal with the rebellious Satan, and take care of man's sin
Christ did not come to the world to become a man according to Adam's image; rather, Adam was created according to Christ's image
Verse 26 tells of the plan in the conference of the Godhead, while verse 27 tells of the creation of man according to the Son's image
Not only was Christ born in Bethlehem and baptized in the Jordan River; the universe was also born and baptized there
Christ was incarnated to be a man in order to come from the position of the Creator to the position of the creature
Christ's redemption not only reconciles all things to God, but also causes man to have life and to be like Him
Satan knew that if his poison were injected into the first couple, this poison would spread to all their descendants
Our baptism and the breaking of bread are to display the victory of Christ's death to the angels, the devil, the nations, and all things
Some think that holiness and victory mean studying the Bible more, praying more, being careful, and trusting in the Lord for one's strength
To be short of patience is to be short of Christ, because God wants Christ to have the first place in all things
If God were to cause us to have power, it would only make us powerful persons; Christ would not have the first place in us
When we believed and received the Son of God, not only did His life enter into us, but His faith also entered into us
We should not only see a substitutionary Savior on Mount Golgotha, we should also see a Lord within us who lives in our stead
After consecration we have to believe that Christ is being lived out in us and that He has taken over our rights
Christ is to be lived out in our flesh in the same way that He was lived out of the flesh given Him through Mary
Christ today wants to live Himself out on the earth through our flesh as He did in His own flesh while on earth
Our victory is based on our yielding to Christ the first place in all things and allowing Him to be the Lord in all of our living
When the relationship between the Israelites and the tabernacle or the temple was proper they were victorious no nation could overcome them
It did not depend on whether or not they had a competent king; neither did it depend on whether or not they were clever and able
God causes us to experience a sweet and suffering life in order that Christ may have the first place in all things
The goal of prayer to let Christ have the first place in all things must be reached, before it will be answered
There is also the receiving of light from God-spiritual vision-which is another sweet side of the Christian life
To be continually under the enlightening we must allow Christ to have the first place in all things continually
Or perhaps it is because of spiritual reasons, where God is behind the scene directing matters with some specific goal
God takes away our material possessions so that we will seek Christ that He may have the first place in all things
The reason we lose our parents, husband, wife, children, and relatives is that God wants us to take Christ as our satisfaction
God takes these away from us in order that we would take Christ as Lord and allow Him to have the first place in us
Through sicknesses, God causes us to learn to trust, rely, and obey, so that Christ may have the first place in us
All believers, no matter what profession they hold, are doing the work of God and should walk in God's good works
Whether or not a work is of faithfulness depends upon the intent, motive, and purpose and if the goal is for Christ
In doing God's work, although there is suffering, there is also joy; although there is difficulty, there is also comfort
God's work from eternity to eternity has always been with the view that His Son would have the first place in all things
Our work should not be for our own increase, our own group, or our own message; rather, we should work for Christ
When people eat the loaves, they thank the one who gives them the loaves; they do not thank the loaves, which are we
We should be satisfied with the work allotted to us by the Lord and with the position the Lord arranged for us
Concerning any truth we should know two things: we should know about this truth, and we should know how this truth relates to the center
The first is to make all things express Christ, and the second is to make man like Christ, that man would have His life and glory
One-third of the angels followed him to rebel against God, and on that day all the living creatures on the earth also followed him
We learn from science that if one speck of dust is out of order, the whole universe can become chaotic and be in confusion
In order to carry out God's two goals and solve His two problems, the Lord Jesus became a man and accomplished redemption
Christ is not only the Christ of the Jews or the Christ of the church, but He is also the Christ of all things
There are three aspects to Christs redemption substitution for the individual representation for the church and heading up for all things
Christ's death as the Head brought all things and mankind into death, so that all things and mankind are now reconciled to God
God wants the church on earth not only to preach the gospel to save sinners but also to testify of Christ's victory on the cross
God allows Satan to remain on the earth in order to provide us the opportunities to testify to His Son's victory
The cross is God's proper judgment according to the law, while the kingdom is the execution of God's authority
Satan cannot overcome the individual Christ, but he can insult the individual Christ through the corporate Christ
God allows us to remain on earth for the purpose of accomplishing His eternal plan and achieving His eternal goal
The Bible tells us that we have three different enemies: the flesh, within us, the world, outside of us, and Satan, above and below us
One day, the archangel tried to uplift himself to be like God by means of the 'self,' and the 'self' entered the world
Originally God expected man to eat the fruit of the tree of life so that he would have God's life to pass on to his offspring
The principle with which Satan beguiled Adam to sin is the same principle as that which caused Satan himself to sin at the beginning
He gains men to be the members of his household and citizens of his kingdom so that he can be the king over them
He said many times that He only spoke what He had heard, and in John 5:30 He said, 'I can do nothing from Myself'
The cross of Christ cuts off like a knife everything of the old creation, while His resurrection brings us into a new beginning
God wants us to be responsible for the cross' cutting off of that part of the old creation which is known to us
Today God is looking for the one hundred and forty-four thousand amidst the defeated church, who will stand on Mount Zion
God always uses a small number of believers to pass on the flow of life to the church and to revive the church
As the Lord has done once before, so these overcomers have to pour out their blood before life can flow out to others
They have to pay the price and allow the cross to cut off all the old creation and deal with the gates of Hades
In considering the overcomers we need to pay attention to two things God chose a few persons to take the place of all the people who failed
God chose the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests among all people but they failed because they worshipped the golden calf at Mount Sinai
God then chose the sons of Levi, who had done His command, to be His overcomers to replace the Israelites as the priests
The principle of the overcomers is for God to allow a few persons to do something that results in blessing for the majority
God plants the cross into their heart for them to experience the principle of the cross in their family and their environment
Today God is seeking for a group of people who, like the priests of old, step into the water, that is, walk into death first
They are willing to be dealt with by the cross first, to stand in the place of death in order that the church will find the way of life
The apostle said God has set forth us the apostles last we have become as the offscouring of the world the scum of all things until now
It is not that they would not spend the money, or that they would not raise an army, but what they do is not adequate
God makes His overcomers first see a truth and confirm such truth before He gains some others to obey this truth
The overcomers are the ones who allow their 'self' to remain in the place of death in order that others might have the life
Many people think that they can help others by acquiring something by their own strength and wisdom and conveying the same to others
Many people think that as long as they understand this truth and preach this truth, everything will be all right
They think that the truth is the truth and that it is not necessary that it has to have anything to do with the person himself
A man must be dealt with, cut open, and saturated by the truth in a deep way before he can convey this truth to others
On the worker's side, whether or not he can create in others a spiritual hunger does not depend on what he says but on what he is
When an advanced one is put together with one who has not made much progress, that one will spontaneously realize his backwardness
When an obedient one is put together with a disobedient one, the disobedient one will spontaneously recognize his own disobedience
In the same way, when a holy one is put side by side with an unholy one, the unholy one will spontaneously realize his own unholiness
All they have to do today is to obey and allow the truth already released to be constituted in their very being
These are the ones who have the ark on their shoulders, whose feet are on the earth, and who are standing firmly on the ground of death
Every time the cross comes upon you, or every time God deals with you, are you willing to accept the dealing, or will you run away from it?
Now we come to the matter of selecting the overcomers, of how to separate the overcomers from the non-overcomers
Numbers says that every male of the Israelites from twenty years old and upward had to be a soldier to go forth to war for the Lord
In order for God to deliver them all He had to select three hundred men who would fight the battle which the others should but did not fight
Many people know how to keep the faith and finish the course, yet they do not know how to fight the good fight
It is easy to be humble before God, but it is very difficult to be humble before man in comparison with others
We should separate ourselves from the defeated ones, but we should not separate ourselves from the other overcomers
A person who has the chance to indulge himself but who will not do so is one who has been dealt with by the cross
Fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church'
We should first allow God to defeat us by the cross, that is we should allow ourselves to be defeated before God
It is not to ask God to do something but to exercise God's authority to deal with the mountain, the things that hinder us
The overcoming ones, the reigning and ruling ones, know how to pray and exercise the authority of God's throne
In order to rule over the church the world and the authority in the heavenlies the overcomers have to exercise the authority of the throne
In England about ten years ago, there were some brothers who had applied the authority of God's throne to govern the political changes
Upon thy belly shalt thou go' means God restricted Satan's work to the earth; he can no longer work throughout the universe
Chapters twelve through fourteen are inserted as a footnote for the previous chapters; they do not form part of the main text
Before the bringing forth of the man-child, the description was concerning the things in the heavens-the sun, the moon, and the stars
After the bringing forth of the man-child, the description is concerning her condition on earth-fleeing to the wilderness
They should fight for themselves but because they cannot do this, God will raise up some overcomers from among them to fight for them
When they are raptured to heaven, Satan will be cast down, and they will take back the serpent's place in heaven
God's 'salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ' will be brought to heaven by them
These persecutions and sufferings force us to become the man-child, and cause us to be among the first to be raptured- the first rapture
Whoever has a place for the dragon in his heart will be persecuted by the dragon; he will go through the tribulation
From the beginning we want to declare that we are not here to expound the Scriptures; rather, we are here to learn a lesson
As such we are using these two portions of the Word to proclaim what we should have experienced and what we have experienced
Ezekiel 44:11, 15-16 says, 'Yet they shall minister in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house
They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them
Although all were Levites belonging to God and to one tribe, the majority among them were only worthy to minister to the house
There was a small minority, who were not only Levites but also the sons of Zadok, who could minister to 'Me'-that is, minister to Jehovah
If you come to the Lord's presence, focusing only on Him, you will spontaneously be able to minister to the brothers also
In the following sections, we will see the basic difference between ministering to the Lord and ministering to the house
We must see clearly that outwardly there may not be much difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord
You may try your best to render help to the brothers, to diligently save the sinners, and to labor much in the service to manage the church
According to his nature, he likes to preach the gospel; so he is happy to do it and feels that he is ministering to the Lord
A sister may think it is dull to stay home and take care of the children, to be someone's wife, and to do all the household chores!
If she could be set free to speak of spiritual things here and speak of the Lord's things there, how good it would be!
Suppose an Israelite wanted to worship God and offer up a peace offering and burnt offering, but he could not drag in the cattle or sheep
The peace offering speaks of a sinner's drawing near to the Lord, while the burnt offering speaks of the consecration of a believer
In the Levites' work, not only were sinners brought to believe in the Lord, but believers were also brought to consecrate themselves
Brothers and sisters, please remember that ministering to the Lord is much deeper than leading men to the Lord
Ministering to the Lord is one step further than leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord
In God's eyes, leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord are merely ministering to the house
Although outwardly they are ministering to sinners and the brothers, inwardly they are ministering to their flesh!
For this reason, we must pray to God to grace us that we may know what it is to minister to God and to the house
Many like to exercise their muscles outside because by killing cattle and sheep, they can exercise their strength and fleshly energy
Brothers, we cannot find a genuine servant of God or true minister to the Lord who does not minister in this way
Others will praise you, saying that you are wonderful and strong because you have killed many cattle and sheep and tied them to the altar
The basis for the ministry to the Lord, the basic requirement for ministering to the Lord, is to draw near to the Lord
Many times even though they are in a room, their heart is wandering outside, and they can no longer come near to the Lord
In order to come to God and kneel before Him for an hour, there is the need for one to exert the strength of his whole being
Indeed, if one does not strive in such a way, he will not be able to maintain such a work; he will not be able to persevere
The disciples could follow the Lord from a far distance, but none of those who followed in that way could minister to Him
It is possible to follow the Lord secretly at a distance, but it is impossible to minister to Him in such a way
We can easily recognize that as Christians we should not take part in evil unclean and lustful things and that these things are intolerable
We may think that such a thing is not bad or that there is nothing better, and we may do it without asking if it is the Lord's will
Indeed, every time we rebel against God, it is because we presume that something is good, and we go ahead and do it
Standing means to not walk or move; it means to remain in a place, to stand still and wait for the Lord's order
Thank the Lord that although every believer does not do this, some are standing before the Lord and following Him in the journey ahead
Without the shedding of blood or the remission of sin, without man paying a price for his sin, God will never be satisfied
All those who would come before God to minister to Him must answer to God's holiness, righteousness, and even His glory
The entire Bible both the Old Testament and the New Testament focuses on these three things Gods holiness Gods righteousness and Gods glory
God's glory refers to God Himself; God's holiness refers to His nature; and God's righteousness refers to His way
As a result, we can approach God without any conflict because His blood has cleansed us from all unrighteousness
In other words, the blood deals with everything in the old creation, and the fat speaks of everything in the new creation
The blood dispels everything of the old creation, so that we no longer have a problem concerning holiness and righteousness
The fat is of the new creation, which signifies the offering of ourselves to God, so that we no longer have a problem with God's glory
Brothers and sisters, we are not willing to minister in the house because our hope and our task are greater than this
The things we are seeking here are greater than many other things, and our labor here is greater than that of many who do great works
Those who ministered to God before Him had to be clothed with linen garments linen bonnets on their heads and linen breeches on their loins
Genesis 3 tells us that, due to Adam's sin, God punished him by saying, 'By the sweat of your face / You will eat bread'
Due to Gods curse the ground ceased to yield its fruit due to the absence of Gods blessing human effort is necessary and this causes sweat
Although outwardly one may be very busy, he is very restful within; although outwardly it is hot, within it is very calm
If you ask them to wait quietly before God and listen to His speaking, they cannot do it because the flesh is not capable of doing this
The reason there are so many advertisements, promotions, and proposals is because men are not praying before God
If we are sweating from morning till evening, then we can surely say to ourselves that we are ministering to the house and not to the Lord
If all our business and laboring are to meet outward needs, we can conclude that we are ministering to people and not to God
God has no way to demand everyone to minister to Him; God cannot do this since many are not willing to minister to Him
Because when the children of Israel turned against the ways of the Lord and forsook Him, the sons of Zadok kept the charge of the sanctuary
They saw that what was on the outside was beyond repair; what was on the outside had collapsed and was contaminated
We know that there are two kinds of soldiers in an army: one kind volunteer to join the army, and the other kind are drafted by the country
God desires to have those who will minister to Him directly and receive the commission by the Holy Spirit directly
We go forth, out from our ministry to the Lord, rather than out from our own desires, which have no basis in the ministry to the Lord
Beyond the veil there is another matter which is just as important Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp bearing His reproach
It is only when we have left the camp to minister to the Lord that He will speak and lead; at other times, He will not speak
These works cause those who have not received the Lord to receive the Lord and those who have received the Lord to be fed
The meaning of eating and drinking is the enjoyment that comes out of our recollection of the work we have done
How often, after we have made some proud achievements, do we think about them even while we are sleeping and relish them in our memory
The first priority is to minister to the Lord because ministering to the Lord is more vital than all the plowing, feeding, and working
Although we have worked much and suffered much, this cannot take the place of the ministering that He should receive
We need to ask God to show us where we should stand in His presence and how we should really minister to Him in His presence
In theory it seems easy to make such a distinction; yet to be able to inwardly distinguish the difference in our experience is a blessing
Many times it requires the putting down of our life and the killing of our opinions before we can truly comprehend it
We need to ask the Lord to grant us grace, revelation, and light, so that we may see what ministering to Him means
The problem is absolutely not with God but with man, because man does not want to be delivered and has not paid the price for deliverance
The apostle who wrote Romans 7 was eventually delivered because he paid the price; he hated something and he willed to do something
Do we sense a hatred for the unclean thoughts the sinful deeds the entangling temper and the evil lusts do we look for deliverance from them
He was so disgusted with his life of sin that he could no longer tolerate it; he felt that he could no longer go along with it
They are not for those who think it is all right to lose one's temper, to be lustful, or have unclean thoughts
Only those who hate their present living and do not wish to continue with such a living can experience this victory
Those who live in failure and sin, not realizing that they have to reject these things, will never find God's deliverance coming to them
Every time a person wants to have spiritual growth in his life before God, he must first be dissatisfied with his present living
We have a great need before God to ask Him to give us the grace to not be content with our life of sin and failure
When he says that we have been delivered from the law or that we are dead to the law, we do not know how to respond
Brothers and sisters, if we desire to experience deliverance, it is very important that we realize that God has no more hope in us
If you want to understand what it is to be delivered from the law, you must first understand the relationship that the law has with us
Not only can God put us under the law, but we, who are in Adam, can also put ourselves under the law, hoping that we can please God
God allows us to sin day after day in order to make us realize that we are corrupt and unclean, and it is impossible to improve
God wants us to realize that the reason He crucified us on the cross, which He did in Christ, is because we are corrupt beyond any hope
When we consider ourselves to be hopeless and realize that God considers us to be hopeless, we will only stand on the position God gives us
Brothers and sisters, in theory and in doctrine we know very well that the old Adamic life is irreparable and incurable
The surprising thing is that in our experience, we still try to repair and improve it; we still cherish hope for the Adamic life
The sooner we see this fact, the better it will be for us, because this is the starting point of all deliverance
All the things which do not come from God's revelation and from our seeing are the things that do not count; they are not effective at all
We have ceased all hope of pleasing God; this comes as a result of understanding the Adamic life and the work of Christ
We must see that the way to overcome is not by making resolutions but by standing on the ground where God has placed us
If we are truly standing in the place of death, we will overcome and experience deliverance from all these things
Nor is it a repeated declaration to ourselves that we are dead, in an effort to signal to ourselves that we are dead
When Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, we were included in His death because God has included us in Him
At the same time, the cherubim were also rent by God from top to bottom because the cherubim were sewn on the veil
The secret to victory is never to look at ourselves apart from Christ and never to consider the self that is outside of Christ
For this reason, in our daily life we should accept this fact all the time so that we can be delivered from the law
In man's eyes, there is nothing better than to ask the Lord to give us the strength not to do the same thing again
In God's eyes, this is redundant, because if we have died in Christ, there is no need to make any more resolutions
It is that we 'might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God'
On the one side we are delivered from the law, and on the other side we are joined to Christ and belong to Christ
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
The one grain that was planted is exactly the same as the thirty, sixty, or hundred grains that will spring forth
In this way, we will no longer have any hope for ourselves but will stand firmly in the position where God has placed us
Concerning this passage, the first thing that brothers and sisters often ask is whether this passage refers to saved ones or unsaved ones
The parable of the sower is not for the purpose of showing how these four kinds of soil relate to saved ones or unsaved ones
When we read Leviticus, we find that those who are twenty years old are evaluated more highly than those who are sixty years old
The reason is that some who were fully for the Lord when they were twenty years old retired before they were sixty
Perhaps the heart you now have is totally different from the heart you had when you first began to follow the Lord
Perhaps some time ago, you were willing to suffer for the Lord and endure tribulations for the sake of God's will
Brothers and sisters, there is only one kind of life that will glorify the Lord; it is a life that bears the cross all the way to the end
False spiritual growth can deceive us and deceive others, but sooner or later, we will see that we cannot get through in a certain matter
May we find light from the Scripture, and may we receive help from God and revelation from the Holy Spirit to see this reason
To spring up means that you have not only confessed the word but have received it into you; the word has begun to grow within you
They are the ones who are willing to give up everything for the Lord at the beginning but become reluctant to do so later
Many who failed halfway had much hope at the beginning they knew that this way was the right way and they expected much from this right way
It is not a question of putting together a few similar verses, categorizing them a little, and composing a little to come up with a message
After we have heard a teaching and received it, God will surely create an environment that calls for the need of that word
Please remember that the affliction and persecution are there only to expose your true condition; they will never take away what is real
They only prove that you have indeed received the Lord's word; they will not cause you to lose the Lord's word
If what you have is not genuine and not purely for the Lord, the trials will smash all that is not real and deceptive
They will show you what you really are within, exposing everything you have within and without to show you if both are the same
Once they were enlightened and received God's revelation, they resolved to serve the Lord properly from that time forward
Please remember that all of our spiritual dryness begins with arguing with God and being unwilling to yield to Him
Whether or not you are faithful is not determined at the time you hear a message, nor is it determined by your confession or acceptance
The reason they can do this is that their roots have stretched themselves to the sweet water; they are no longer afraid of the hot sun
They are not living by the Lord, but by man's word, their own thoughts, and the arrangement of the environment
If we fall back at the trials and do not take up the cross to press on, we will not be of much use to the Lord
Rather, we will be shallow, without much of anything, sensitive in our feelings, and living according to our feelings
In a tree, the part that can be seen is the trunk, while the part beneath the ground, which cannot be seen, is the root
Those who do not have a hidden life who do everything before men and have nothing special before the Lord cannot stand the test of the cross
Other than the part of your living, testimony, Bible reading, and prayer that have been done before men, how much has been done in secret?
We have always thought that prayer is something that is heard however the Lord did not say that prayers are heard but that prayers are seen
Many times when we have no words before the Lord, our attitude alone is precious enough, because God is seeing and not just hearing us
We suffer more temptations than others, because it is easier for us to put everything before men; we can even display what we have in secret
Everything that man has must first be properly tested on the cross and able to stand the test before it can be considered reliable
The only way that we can know that we will not fall in that day is by having an adequate amount of hidden life today
Unfortunately, a countless number of people have to think before they will make a decision concerning God's command!
Thank the Lord that there are many who only care 'who' is giving the command and never question 'why' before they obey
If you have not dealt thoroughly with the hidden sins, and if the stubborn self is not thoroughly dealt with, your roots will never be deep
If there is a problem between you and God, it will be impossible for the earth to have any depth or the roots to be deep
If the Lord was able to sit on a donkey that had never been sat on when He entered Jerusalem, He can sit on you as well
Do not treasure what the world says to you, because the Bible shows that the Lord is only pleased with those who have roots that go downward
A similar passage is found in the Song of Solomon 412 which says A garden enclosed is my sister my bride A spring shut up a fountain sealed
The Lord says that we are a garden enclosed and that we are not open at any other time the only time we are open is when we open to the Lord
What God is seeking today and the one thing that grips our heart, is a hidden life before Him, something invisible to man
Other than having a special calling and commission from God, there would be no need for us to exist independently
Not until the fullness of time did God release certain truths during particular periods of time and cause them to be revealed once more
Luther was merely the one who realized this truth in a stronger way; he was particularly outstanding in this truth
The second period is the time immediately after the Reformation, from the sixteenth century to the eighteenth century
When Luther was raised up by God, he saw the light and proposed that man go back to the truth in the book of Romans
He considered administrative questions transitional, temporal, and of the outer court, and not matters that belong to the Holy Place
Although this matter was not successfully recovered, the truth of justification by faith was definitely recovered
God dug up this buried truth from all the traditions, human opinions, and creeds and caused this truth to be known and preached once more
If a person were born in that age, what he should have done was preach this truth and exhort others concerning this truth
In 1524 the Anabaptists, a group of believers who proposed re-baptism after infant-sprinkling, were raised up in Germany
After the Anglican Church was established in England, these people told others that the church should not have anything to do with politics
Although it freed itself from the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, it found itself linked with British politics
They said that the church should not be under the state's control and that church and state should have a clear separation
By reading his Bible, Spener found out that the church at his time was full of human opinions, something forbidden by God
In his meetings he began to teach others to reject the traditional formalities and to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit
The latter was only twenty-two years of age at that time and was a member of the aristocracy in a small kingdom
Due to the persecution in Moravia, the brothers fled from their land and were received by Brother Zinzendorf in his territory
From that time on, missionaries were produced from among them, and the Moravian Church became the strongest missionary body at that time
At that time, when men read Revelation 2 and 3, they realized that Protestantism had indeed come out of Catholicism
When such groups were raised up, unlike other organizations, they did not call people to come out of their original organizations
These two brothers together with George Whitefield began to hold open-air meetings and bring people to the Lord in this way
The teaching of the eradication of sin began with him, although he also told others that sanctification came by faith
The Methodists also expanded the scope of their mission organization and became the Methodist Missionary Society of today
In conclusion, the reforms of the sixteenth century were widespread, while the reforms of the eighteenth century were not
The reforms of the sixteenth century affected the world not only spiritually but politically and socially as well
Of all the movements in the eighteenth century, the most noteworthy was the testimony of the 'Philadelphia' church
Through prayer and fellowship, they felt that they should rise up and meet according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14
A short while later, a former Anglican minister, John Nelson Darby, began to join their meeting and to expound the Bible among them
When we consider the presentday church organizations we see many human traditions and opinions and little direct leading of the Holy Spirit
All those who belong to the Lord should learn to be led by the Holy Spirit and should not follow man's direction
In addition the Brethren made many discoveries concerning the millennium the question of rapture and the prophecies in Daniel and Revelation
The Brethren also made a clear separation between the biblical prophecies concerning the Jews and those concerning the church
He discovered that while it is true that a man is saved by faith, he is rewarded according to his works before God
He taught that man should claim God's promises through prayer, and he testified of his way of living by faith in relation to financial needs
Simpson emphasized that it was not the healing but the resurrection life that overcame the weaknesses of the flesh
They continued the line of truth concerning self-denial preached by ones like Madame Guyon two hundred years earlier in the Catholic Church
He received help both from Smith and from others like Madame Guyon and exerted a definite spiritual influence in that period of time
John Wesley once said that he wished every believer would read the messages of Madame Guyon and that he owed much grace to her
God gained such a woman in the seventeenth century and through her brought in the main current of the nineteenth century
She, however, could not believe that the kind of total self-denial, faith, and love described in these writings could ever be practiced
One day while disputing and arguing with God, she sought desperately for the Lord to bring her into these truths
Brother Holden, an ex-missionary of the China Inland Mission, came to know the meaning of the cross through reading Mrs
We can see that the discovery of God's truth is progressive; the more it advances, the more complete it becomes
During this revival many towns saw their whole population saved to such an extent that there were no more souls to save
During the past few years, almost all of the messages talked about among spiritual believers have been the teachings of Mrs
From 1908 to 1909, a number of black believers on Azusa Street experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues
From the above discussion we can see the different discoveries of God's truths that took place before and during this century
Gradually we began to see the victory of Christ the resurrection life the teaching of the cross the work of the Holy Spirit and so forth
From 1926 on we began to release many messages concerning salvation the church and the cross and we testified much concerning these things
We saw that concerning the cross, there is not only the truth concerning Christ's death, but there is also the fact of resurrection
In the past the resurrection which we preached was mainly a matter of faith; it was not related to our experience
Later the Lord showed him different truths concerning the meaning of resurrection and the meaning of the church life
Despite the above revelations, it was not until 1934 that we realized that the centrality of everything related to God is Christ
God's overcomers are a group of people who take the lead to stand in the place of death on behalf of the whole congregation
In the same way, we can say that although we have received help from our brothers, these revelations were not received from man
It is the message of Colossians 1:18 which says that God desires to see Christ have the first place in all things
If someone wants to work in a locality where there is no meeting, he has to be responsible to the Lord directly
After Paul and Barnabas were sent out from Antioch, they engaged themselves in the work commissioned by the Holy Spirit
The sending of the church is merely the execution of the order of the Holy Spirit and the confirmation of the move of the Holy Spirit
Many times, even though we do not agree with the proposal of a certain brother, we still have to give him the liberty to do it
As to apostles, their responsibility is limited to only the work they are commissioned to do; they have no overseeing responsibility
Even if he does not take preaching as a profession, he can still have these gifts and do the work that the workers are doing
Many people think that if they cannot work in one locality, they can change to another locality and perhaps work there
The result of a work is not only related to the gift of the worker but also is directly related to the life of the worker
Today many workers are building their work with one hand and tearing it down with the other hand because there is a lack of life
Not only will spiritual brothers testify for him, even brothers who are not spiritual will also testify for him
After the matter has been decided, they will inform the brothers and assign various responsibilities to the deacons
According to the Bible, the workers who come afterward should submit to the workers who were there before them
On the one hand, some workers are completely controlled and bound by those above them, and all of the decisions arise from human ideas
A worker must not be controlled by others in the matter of money and must not hand this authority over to others
If a young worker does not learn the lesson of submission properly, he will not be able to learn any other lesson
One can see from the letter Paul wrote to Timothy that he was very strict in his instructions to the younger workers
The problem is that no one in the world today is keeping to his own position or is satisfied with his own position
The younger workers must not only submit to the older workers personally but must also know where God has put them
Every younger worker can always find someone who is more mature and more advanced from whom he can learn submission
The younger ones should be this way and even the older ones are without an exception because no one can be independent
Even if God uses a worker to discover a certain truth, he cannot move independently; he must go on in mutual submission
One basic principle in reading the Bible is to simply accept what God's Word says and not add our own thoughts to it
The offerings of the believers are not merely for the support of the workers; they are to supply those who work for the Lord
In other words, one does not offer to a certain person simply because he is a worker; he offers to that person because he works for the Lord
A believer among us attended meetings in a certain denomination for twenty years but never even nodded his head toward another person
Part of the money received in the meetings should be set aside for the local workers and the workers in other localities
The condition of the Corinthians was just the opposite; they developed a problem in their fellowship with Paul
As a result, Paul was willing to allow other churches to suffer, rather than ask for any money from the Corinthians
The workers from out of town should not misunderstand and think that the church in Shanghai is so rich that it can keep sending money out
Do not be afraid that by doing this, others will misunderstand and think that you are rich or have struck a fortune
If he does not have the faith that his living will be cared for, he should look for some work to sustain his living
If a brother in a locality cannot get by and has no means to support his living, either the church or individual believers should help him
The church cannot sit there and do nothing for the brothers who are unemployed; it must do its best to help them
The order for helping is to care for the brothers and sisters in your locality first, and then to help the poor people outside
Every time a brother comes from another locality he needs to give us a letter of recommendation before we can receive him at the Lords table
