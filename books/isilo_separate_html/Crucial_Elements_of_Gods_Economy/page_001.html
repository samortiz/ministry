<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages spoken by Brother Witness Lee in New York City on September 1 through 4, 1978. From July through September 1978 Brother Lee visited many localities in the United States and Canada, giving a series of conferences to meet a timely need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. His two main burdens in these conferences were the believers&rsquo; personal contact with the Lord as branches abiding in the vine, and the vision and practice of the proper church life.</p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
