   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This message deals with the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The northern kingdom is often represented by Ephraim, and the southern kingdom by Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter twenty-eight we see that Jehovah's judgment over Ephraim's drunkards issues in Jehovah's restoration and ushers in the trustworthy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter twenty-nine Jehovah's judgment on the hypocrisy of Jerusalem's worshippers issues in the restoration.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the New Testament, when Christ came, He came with reality John 1:14, 17 and wisdom Matt 11:19; 1 Cor 1:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the hypocritical worship spoken of in Isaiah 29, there is vanity but no reality, blindness but no wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through His incarnation Christ brought to us the very reality of the universe the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, embodied in a person, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we removed the Divine Trinity from the universe, it would become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the entire universe, only the Divine Trinity is real, and the Divine Trinity has been embodied in a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This man came with God; thus, He is Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With this Immanuel we have the universal reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have this reality, our eyes, our ears, and our understanding are opened, and we become very understanding and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This wisdom is the embodied reality the Divine Trinity in Christ in our realization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we realize the embodied Divine Trinity in Christ, this brings us wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we have both reality and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would ask you to keep this word in mind as we now turn to Isaiah 28 and 29.</S>
