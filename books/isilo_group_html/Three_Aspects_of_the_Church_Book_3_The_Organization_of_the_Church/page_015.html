Being the Fruit of an Apostle&rsquo;s Labor</h2>
<p>Since the authority of the apostles comes from the Head, the source of authority in the organization of the church is surely the Head. However, who can be considered an apostle? The Corinthians questioned the apostleship of Paul, and he responded by saying, &ldquo;If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you; for you in the Lord are the seal of my apostleship&rdquo; (9:2). Paul&rsquo;s word here sounds like that of a parent speaking to his children. Parents may not be parents to others, yet surely they are parents to their children. First Corinthians 9 provides the strongest and clearest example of what it means to be an apostle.</p>
<p>To use more familiar terminology, an apostle can be compared to a father who has begotten children. In Paul&rsquo;s case he might not have been an apostle to others, but surely he was an apostle to the Corinthians. He asked them, &ldquo;Are you not my work in the Lord?&rdquo; (v. 1). This means that if he were not an apostle, how could the Corinthians have become believers? If he were not their father, how could there be believers in Corinth? The believers in Corinth were the seal of Paul&rsquo;s apostleship, that is, of his being a father. Not everyone is a father. Although a man may be fifty or eighty years old, he may not be a father. Only those who have begotten children are fathers.</p>
<p>To others Paul may not have been an apostle, yet surely he was to the Corinthians. They were his work in the Lord. To those who examined him, Paul replied, &ldquo;You are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.&rdquo; His defense was truly wise. We need to firmly understand a basic matter; that is, the fruit of a person&rsquo;s labor in the Lord is a proof of his apostleship. If a person preaches the gospel to the natives of Taiwan, labors for the Lord among them, saves and raises up some to serve God, and establishes a church, undoubtedly he is an apostle to these ones. It is meaningless for someone merely to consider himself to be an apostle or to feel that he is an apostle. Only the actual fruit of his work is proof of his apostleship.</p>
<p>However, we also need to ask ourself: Did I do the work by myself or in the Lord? Did I do the work on my own or was I sent by the Lord? A person doing a work must be certain of two matters: He must know that he has been sent by the Lord and that he is doing the work in the Lord. While others may not know whether our work is in the Lord, we ourselves should know. If a person does a certain work by himself and obtains positive results, these results alone are not proof of his apostleship. A person&rsquo;s work must be done in the Lord, with the Lord, and through being mingled with the Lord. The result will be proof of his apostleship.</p>
<p>The term <em>apostle</em> means &ldquo;sent one.&rdquo; Every believer is able to sense if a person has been sent by the Lord to do the work and whether or not he is doing the work by himself. There is a difference. If I send someone to do something, he has my authority, but if he does something by himself, he does not have my authority. If the government sent me to do something, the authority of the government would be behind me; however, if I were to do something by myself, I may not have the proper authority. Although there is not much difference outwardly, there is a big difference inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being One Who Submits to God&rsquo;s Authority<br />
and Who Is Sent by God</h2>
<p>A person who works for the Lord must submit to the authority of the Head; he must be governed and controlled entirely by the Head. Such a worker does not go out by himself but is charged by the Holy Spirit and sent by the Head. Since he is sent and appointed by the Head, authority is with him. It may be difficult for people to determine whether or not he is an apostle, but he himself should have the assurance when he goes out to work that he is under the authority of the Head, controlled by the Head, and sent by the Head. A worker is sent by the Head to do the work of the Head; thus, he does not know what it means to be political in order to please people. If the Head did not send him, he would not do the work.</p>
<p>I can testify before the Lord whom I serve that when I encounter problems, I go to Him. I do not beg Him; rather, I say, &ldquo;Lord, this is Your business and not mine. This is not my work but what You desire me to do.&rdquo; Concerning what we do, we need to ask ourselves whether the work is ours or the Lord&rsquo;s, and whether it is we who want to do it or the Lord who wants us to do it. If it is our work, and if it is we who want to do it, we will not have apostolic authority. Apostolic authority lies with the Head. In Acts 13:2 the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; Hence, it is the Lord who sends, and it is His work that they do. The sending and the work are the Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War, I went to Nanking because I was very clear that the Lord wanted me to go there. Prior to this, the brothers in Nanking also had much prayer, not only for my coming but also for the many problems among us at that time, including personal problems and problems related to the entire work. According to my desire, I had planned to work in northern China, but after much prayer and seeking over a long period of time, I was clear that the Lord wanted me to go to Nanking. The first time I spoke in Nanking, I said, &ldquo;I have come here with a burden, and I want to impart this burden into you.&rdquo; Not long after that, a brother with whom I was well acquainted came to visit me with the president of a certain seminary. According to courtesy and custom, I should have paid the president of the seminary a return visit. But when I went back to my room, the Lord spoke to me within: &ldquo;I sent you here to work and not to please men. His coming to visit you is his business. He is also My child, My servant, and is responsible to Me. Who desires that you pay him a return visit?&rdquo; The seminary president came to visit me, yet I did not pay him a return visit. It was not because of my pride but because of a strong forbidding within me. Since the Lord did not want me to go, I could not go. Moreover, I could not say anything, because I am not a diplomat or a politician. I was in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. I could only do what He wanted me to do.</p>
<p>Although I was in that city for an entire year, I did not visit any of the preachers. In this regard, I became a cold and impolite person. The Lord can testify that this was not due to my pride but due to the inner forbidding. The work in Nanking was not my work. To visit the preachers would have been of great convenience to the work, but I did not have the right to do so. Likewise, when I came to Taiwan, the situation was also very difficult. Many people asked me to visit certain ones, but the Lord spoke the same word to me again: &ldquo;I brought you here to do My work and not to please men.&rdquo; The most important matter is whether the authority of the Head is with us. When we work for the Lord, are we concerned about behaving ourselves properly, or are we concerned about laboring as those sent by the Lord? If we desire to simply behave ourselves properly, we ourselves will have to take care of every aspect. Nevertheless, the authority of the Head will not be with us, and we will not be as those who are sent by Him for His work.</p>
<p>If someone thinks that in the service his purpose is to help a certain brother, then it is better for him not to have a part in the service. No aspect of the work belongs to men. All the work belongs to the Head, the Lord of hosts. Some people say to me, &ldquo;You have to bear so many burdens and take care of so many matters. How is it that you are always at rest and rejoicing?&rdquo; I tell them, &ldquo;Please consider: Is this my business? Is this my work? This is the Lord&rsquo;s business, the Lord&rsquo;s work. I do however much He wants me to do. He must take care of the rest.&rdquo; The workers need to be saved by reminding themselves constantly that the work which they do is the Lord&rsquo;s work, not their own work. If it is the Lord&rsquo;s work, the Lord has the authority and will bear the responsibility. If we do the work of the Lord of hosts, all those who serve Him on earth are our co-workers. If we do our own work, it is no wonder that we work alone.</p>
<p>An apostle is under the authority of the Head. To be an apostle is to be a sent one. If the Head has not sent us, it is meaningless for us to seek to be an apostle. No man can appoint us to be an apostle. Man does not have the authority to appoint apostles. Only when a person is under the Head, commissioned by the Head, and sent by the Head to do His work can he be an apostle. Even if others do not acknowledge him as an apostle, the Lord who sent him will still regard him as an apostle. Whoever the Head sends is an apostle, and the authority of the Head is with him.</p>
<p>No one can appoint others to be apostles. Whether or not a person is an apostle is not determined by others. The offices in the church are altogether a matter of the authority of the Head. If none of us submits to the authority of the Head, there will be no offices in the church. We might pray to receive the gift to give a few messages, but there will be no offices in the church. In order to have an office and represent authority in the church, we need to submit to the authority of the Head. There must be some who submit to the authority of the Head, who are sent by the Head, who fast and pray, and who wait for the Lord&rsquo;s command. There must be some who have heard, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul, not for their own work but for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; Without authority, there will be no offices in the church, only gifts.</p>
<p>The desolate condition of Christianity is related to having gifts but not offices. When some are stirred up and zealous, they preach the gospel, give sermons, and obtain certain results; however, they do not have the authority of the Holy Spirit, the authority of the Head. They have only gifts but no offices. For the church to be strong and to meet the Lord&rsquo;s need in the present age, we must prostrate ourselves, submit to the authority of the Head, and say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I am here. What do You want to do?&rdquo; The most important matter is not gifts but offices. Although some may not be able to give messages, when you contact them, you sense an authority that cannot be violated. This does not mean that they are presumptuous and have assumed a high position; on the contrary, they are surely men who prostrate themselves in dust and ashes.</p>
<p>Such a person would say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Head, and I am a slave who has been bought by You. I prostrate myself. I do not have my work, my purpose, my future, my inclination, my choice, and my preference. Lord, I am a slave. I will say whatever You want me to say and do whatever You want me to do.&rdquo; The authority in such a one is definite. He is surely an apostle. He does not need to wear the label of an apostle. In him there is simply the authority of the Head. Once the church submits to the authority of the Head, immediately offices, authority, and order will be manifested. Then people will see that the church is strong and functioning.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
