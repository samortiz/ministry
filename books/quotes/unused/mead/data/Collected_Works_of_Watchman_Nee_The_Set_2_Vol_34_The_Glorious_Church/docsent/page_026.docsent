   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WOMAN IN THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 12:1 says, "And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who is the woman described here?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She is a woman over whom many Bible students have had much dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some have said that she signifies Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Others have said that she stands for the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, according to the Scriptures this woman can neither be Mary, the mother of the Lord, nor the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here are the reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 Since this vision is revealed in heaven, this woman is entirely of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither Mary nor the nation of Israel have this position.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 After this woman bore the man-child, she fled into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we liken this woman to the nation of Israel, the man-child she brought forth to Christ, and the man-child being caught up to the ascension of Christ, this does not correspond with the actual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although the nation of Israel was scattered, her going into the wilderness was not the result of Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time Christ ascended, Israel had already been dispersed for some time and was no longer a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But here we see that the woman fled into the wilderness after the man-child was caught up unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Long before Christ ascended, the nation of Israel was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, it is impossible for this woman to be a reference to the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is even less of a basis to refer to her as Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 While this woman was in travail to bring forth the man-child, she encountered a dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This dragon had seven heads and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapter seventeen tells us that these seven heads are seven kings: five have fallen, one is still existing, and the other has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, who will arise afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know that no such historical events occurred before Christ ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, this woman and the man-child must refer to things in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we say that this woman refers either to the nation of Israel or to Mary and that the man-child refers to the Lord Jesus, we are contradicting history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4 After the man-child was caught up unto God, there was war in heaven, and Satan was cast down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then there was a proclamation in heaven: "Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night" Rev 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that this has not yet been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 6 tells us that the church on earth must still battle with the rulers, authorities, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since this portion of Scripture has not yet occurred, it is impossible for it to be a reference to the time of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>5 When the dragon was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people use this as a confirmation that the woman is Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Mary gave birth to the Lord Jesus she did flee to Egypt; however, she did not do this at the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 14 through 16 say, "And to the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether it is said that this woman is a reference to Mary or to the nation of Israel, we know from history that no such thing happened when Christ ascended to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, this woman cannot be a reference to Mary or to the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>6 There is one more proof.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 17 says, "And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the man-child, who was born of the woman, was caught up to the throne, a remnant of her seed still remained upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This could not be Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, this remnant keeps the commandments of God and has the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is all right to say that the nation of Israel kept the commandments of God, but to say that the nation of Israel held the testimony of Jesus would mix the Old Testament with the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In conclusion, it is impossible for this woman to be Mary or the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who then is this woman?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Old Testament shows that only one woman encountered the serpent Eve in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the New Testament there is also only one woman who encounters the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we see the correspondence and correlation of the Scriptures, the beginning with the end. Furthermore, God particularly points out that the great dragon is the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that He is referring to the serpent who had been mentioned once before.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God makes the point clear that it was that one and only old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The emphasis is on the word "the" the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the woman mentioned here must also be that woman.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sun, moon, and stars mentioned in Genesis 1 are mentioned in Revelation 12 in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the serpent was in Genesis 3, so the serpent is here also.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The seed of the woman mentioned in Genesis 3 is also mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, the travail of birth is in Genesis 3, and it is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we put these two portions of Scripture together, we can surely see that the woman in Revelation 12 is the woman whom God purposed in His eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything that will happen to her at the end time is clearly stated here.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The woman in Genesis 2 speaks of God's eternal purpose; the woman in Ephesians 5 speaks of the position and future of the church; and the woman in Revelation 12 reveals the things at the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In addition to these three women, there is another woman who shows forth the things in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the woman appeared in the vision, the Scriptures pointed out firstly that she was "clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars" 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These facts are very meaningful in reference to the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>1 The woman was clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The sun refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Her being clothed with the sun means that when the sun shines the brightest, it is shining upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this present age, God is revealing Himself through her.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This shows her relationship with Christ and the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>2 The woman had the moon underneath her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This phrase "underneath her feet" does not mean that she is treading upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to the Greek, it means that the moon is subject at her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The light of the moon is a reflecting light; it has no light of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All the things in the age of the law merely reflected the things in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The law was but a type.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The temple and the ark were types.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The incense, the showbread in the Holy Place, and the sacrifices offered by the priests were all types, as well as the blood of the sheep and oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The moon underneath the feet of the woman means that all things pertaining to the law are subordinate to her.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This speaks of her relationship to the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>3 The woman had a crown of twelve stars upon her head.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The chief figures in the age of the patriarchs were from the time of Abraham to the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The crown of twelve stars upon her head speaks of her relationship to the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this way, we see that the woman is not only related to the age of grace, but also to the age of the law and the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, she is more closely related to the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She includes all the saints in the age of grace, as well as all the saints from the ages of the law and the patriarchs.</S>
