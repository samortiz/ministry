   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT CAPTIVITY AND RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to eat Christ as the choice portion of the harvest, we need three things: the harvest, the unique place chosen by God, and the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to release our spirit so that Christ may be released.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of these three points is found in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have a harvest means to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When some Christians hear this, they will say, We never heard of such a thing as growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isn t Christ perfect and complete?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we grow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the centuries, Christians have not held the concept of growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The phrase, grow Christ, cannot be found in Christian writings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>EATING CHRIST, NOT OUR LIMITATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am quite concerned that you understand accurately what it means to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a foregoing message I shared with you how to grow Christ as wheat in the midst of limited situations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, this does not mean that we should eat the limitations; instead, we must eat the Christ that grows in limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The concept of eating the limitation comes from traditional teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These teachings began with the book, The Imitation of Christ, by Thomas Kempis.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through the reading of this book many Christians have received the impression that they must suffer and bear the cross, that is, that they must eat their limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many think that Christians should have long faces and wrinkled brows.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently the teaching that we must bear the cross and sacrifice for others is scriptural; actually it is mixed up with a natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The main teaching in Hinduism is that of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to be careful about mixing the truth of self-denial through the cross of Christ with the natural concept of the religious, ethical, or heathen teachings concerning suffering and sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those religious and ethical teachings easily fit our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The revelation in the Bible is vastly different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Bible, we need to live by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we need to allow Christ to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of eating the cross, we need to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The message on growing Christ as wheat and barley was not a word about eating the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was a word about living by Christ and with Christ, a word about growing Christ in our limited situations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BEING SHORT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just recently I was talking with a young brother about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I asked him about his experience in married life, he said, Before I was married, I thought I was quite patient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But married life has really exposed me, and now I see that I am not very patient at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This brother was saying that married life exposed his shortage of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then I replied, Brother, it is wrong to say that married life exposes your lack of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should say that married life exposes your lack of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One of the largest families in China is the Chang family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Chang family was famous for patience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In their living rooms they were accustomed to hanging a picture showing the character for patience printed in a hundred different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way the Chang family boasted of its patience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every member of the Chang family learned the lesson of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day, a member of the Chang family was married.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before he was married, he thought he had a great deal of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But his married life exposed him, showing that he was actually short of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother, in saying that married life exposes your lack of patience, you are not being a Christian; you are being a member of the Chinese Chang family.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many missionaries to China were not able to differentiate Christian patience from Chinese patience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although I was born in China, I was born into Christianity, I was raised in Christianity, and I studied in Christian schools.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I learned both the Chinese ethical teachings and the biblical ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some missionaries even told us that the ethics in the Bible were exactly the same as the ethics of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time, although I was unsaved and unregenerated, I was absolutely for Christianity because it was my family religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever anyone opposed Christianity, I was prepared to fight for it and defend it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time, I was very troubled when I read the classical Chinese writings and compared them with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seemed that the ethics in the classical Chinese writings were excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I told myself that the Bible and the Chinese philosophers teach the same thing as far as ethics are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I was nineteen years of age, I was genuinely saved and thoroughly converted.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I was saved to know the Lord Jesus and to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After I was saved, I realized that there was a great difference between the teachings of the Bible and the teachings of the Chinese philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The difference is that the Chinese philosophy emphasizes ethics, whereas the Bible emphasizes Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For His economy, God s concern is not ethics, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we should not say that we are short of patience; rather, we should say that we are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the early years we used certain expressions that were not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, when a brother said that he could not endure living with his troublesome wife, we would say, Brother, you need to learn some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You are short of patience and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You need to learn the lesson of being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The reason you cannot bear living with your difficult wife is that you have not been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother, the Lord intends to break you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today I regret the use of certain expressions, such as learning the lessons and being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not short of patience, endurance, and brokenness; we are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Suppose a certain person has very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even if he were broken into pieces, he would still be short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thomas Kempis taught us to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But even if we bore the cross for thousands of miles, we still would not have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not short of bearing the cross; we are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is very important to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Consider the example of a young married brother who truly loves the Lord and seeks Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His wife also loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In fact, it was because they were both seeking the Lord that they fell in love and were married.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, although they both have Christ, they have not yet gained very much of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Unintentionally, this brother s wife gives him a great deal of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The brother becomes so desperate that he goes to his pastor for help.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The pastor opens his Bible to Ephesians 5:25, which says, Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This brother s pastor then proceeds to tell him that he must learn the lessons of patience, endurance, and sympathizing with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The brother accepts the counsel of his pastor, returns home, and tries his best to sympathize with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But although he tries to be patient and to endure, he is not successful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One day this brother and his wife come into the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When he brings the problem of his difficult wife to one of the elders, he is told, Brother, after listening to you talk about your problems in your married life, I realize that you have never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Brother, you need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The brother accepts this advice, returns home, and tries to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Eventually, this also is of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Finally, he goes to yet another elder and presents the problem to him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This brother, knowing the way revealed in the Scripture, says, Brother, you are not short of patience, endurance, or brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What you need is more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Are you willing to learn to breathe Christ in?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You will never be able to bear your dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Do not try to bear the cross gain more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Are you willing to open up your spirit and call on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When you gain more of Christ, your problem will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The brother gladly takes this advice and gains more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Although his wife remains the same and is difficult to live with, this brother has more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Every time his wife troubles him, he grows more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>And the more he grows of Christ, the greater a harvest he has of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thus, he is able to eat of Christ, not just as the manna, but as the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is no need for this brother to eat his limitation or his cross.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Instead, he needs to eat the Christ he has experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Years ago, we did not see this matter very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Therefore, when the brothers came to me with problems in their married life, I told them to learn the lessons of patience, endurance, and brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In my experience, however, I found that these teachings did not work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>When I realized this, I was troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I was like a doctor who administered a prescription that did not heal the ailment.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Eventually, I discovered another dose.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This dose is not patience or endurance or brokenness it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The reason a brother is unable to bear the cross of his wife is not because he lacks patience, endurance, and brokenness; it is because he is short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>From that time onward, I began to practice this myself.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I tested this prescription in my own laboratory by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I opened my spirit and my whole being to let the Lord Jesus come into me more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When Christ is added to me, defeat becomes victory.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This does not mean that the environment changes, nor even that I change myself.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is that more of Christ is added into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is what it means to grow Christ, to allow Him to increase within.</S>
