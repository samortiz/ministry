   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By eating we have digesting; by digesting we have the assimilation; and by this assimilation we get the practical nourishment of the riches of Jesus into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the riches of Christ eventually will grow into our organic tissues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is no more I, but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Christian life is not a matter of imitating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not try to learn to be humble the way that Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is like trying to teach a monkey to imitate a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The monkey might be able to do this for a while, but eventually it will go back to being what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's way is not the way of teaching us to imitate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's way is the way of life, and the way of life is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of the American brothers became big not by being taught but by being fed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was by their eating that they grew up into big men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No doubt, in another sense, we all need some education, but the basic thing is the growth, and this growth depends absolutely upon eating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eating is to take some nourishment into you for digestion and assimilation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this you will get the nourishment into your cells, and this nourishment even will become your organic tissues, your very being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christianity has given you the wrong impression that you need doctrinal teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have to say, "We don't need the doctrinal teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need the nourishment."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need Jesus, not in an objective way but in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need Jesus to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to assimilate Jesus so that He can become our cells and our organic tissues to become our very essence and element.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we can say, "For me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the content and the container become one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus, after getting into us, becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you say, "For me to live is Christ," the Lord Jesus would say, "For Me to live is you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say that you are Jesus, but He would say that He is you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then who is who?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, the content becomes the container.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the religious veils have to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From Genesis 2 to Revelation 22, through the whole Bible, you have such a line of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tree of life and the river of water are seen in Genesis 2 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Jesus came and said that He is the bread of life which we must eat John 6:35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He also said that He is the living water which we must drink John 4:14; 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even in the Epistles, Paul said "I fed you..."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 Cor 3:2 ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also said that we all have been made to drink of one Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have been made to drink, not to think.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all have been made, not to think of one theology but to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then at the end of the Bible, we see the river of water of life and the tree of life Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last promise given by the Lord is: "Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life" v. 14a . The last call given by the Lord is to come and take the water of life freely v. 17 . Our destiny for eternity will be to eat and drink Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today we should give ourselves to eat and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But you also need to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After calling on the Lord, after eating and drinking Him, you have to say, "Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Cause every part of my being to be open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Have the thoroughfare within my whole being."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then you will have a good digestion for a good assimilation, and you will enjoy and absorb all the nourishment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then Christ will become your very being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are the living containers, and He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, the life-giving Spirit as the content will be our element and our essence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will be one with Him, and He will be one with us in an organic way.</S>
