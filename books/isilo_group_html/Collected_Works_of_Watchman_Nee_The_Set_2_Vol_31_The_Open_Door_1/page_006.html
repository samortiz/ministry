May the Lord bless you according to His promise. On the fourth of November I arrived at Lo-Yuen from the Lian River. After the meeting at Lo-Yuen, the Lord willing, I shall travel to Ning-Teh, Foo-An, and Shia-Pu. In the east Fukien region, the X denomination is predominant. But if it is the Lord's will, there is hope for some building work in the future. God led me to come here to gather the building material. Although the majority of the people know my standing, the leaders have gladly received me because I have caused no turmoil in their midst. Though the eastern part of Fukien province is politically unstable, we still have the peace in the Lord to labor on. Finally, I hope for your constant supplication. In a rush; peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Bi-yin<br />November 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Pioneer Work at Fu-Ching and Dong-Jang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X, greatly beloved in the Lord:</p><p>May the Spirit of the Lord doubly fill you, amen. I am grateful to the Lord that in this extraordinary time of affliction in the world, we are still lying calmly beside the brook of Cherith in Christ. Hallelujah! He is ever unchanging. Though the floods overflow, He still sits as the King. Under His wings we receive every new blessing. Truly blessed and memorable is our Lord forever! Amen. Thank the Lord for leading Brother Bin-shi to pioneer the work at Fu-Ching and Dong-Jang. The Holy Spirit has confirmed the gospel preaching with signs and wonders. More than ten households already have produced fruit of repentance and burned their idols. I also went to Dong-Jang after he had worked and saw the glory of the Lord. Praise the Lord. May glory be to Him! Amen. Dong-Jang is one of the five towns of Yung-Yi, ten miles from Hong-Luh and twenty-five miles from Yung-Tai and Yi-Du. It is the beachhead for the preaching of the word and for outreach into inland regions. We have rented a house and purchased the benches. Soon there will be baptisms and the breaking of bread. This is the time for the preaching of the gospel because the Holy Spirit is still saving souls there. Thank the Lord that when we are persecuted in Jerusalem, He opens the door for the word to go out in Samaria and sets our footsteps free. Truly the Lord is returning soon. There will be a great revival in the last days. Lord, in these days may You revive Your work! Amen.</p><p>We have rented a meeting hall in Sien-You but have not yet started the breaking of bread to remember the Lord. Many are saved in Sien-You, and there should be those who will keep the Lord's name to the end. The Lord willing, we will go ahead with everything in Sien-You. Brothers Ke-san and Tse-chung are both well and serving the Lord at Pu-Tien. The coastal regions in Fukien are well. Brother Fang Shi-rong, the responsible brother in Han River, has contracted tuberculosis. Please pray for him. Please pray also for me. How is your physical health, my brother? I remember you often. May the Lord grace and bless your family (2 Cor. 12:9; Heb. 12:2; Hymn #121).</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Jai-seng<br />November 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
