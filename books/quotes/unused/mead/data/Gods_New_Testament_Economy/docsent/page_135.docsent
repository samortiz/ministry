   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Living with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should be those living with the Father as the source of life John 1:13; Eph 4:18; John 5:26 on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first striking point of the New Jerusalem is that God is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This God is the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:1 does not tell us that in the beginning God and the Lamb created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first verse of the book of Genesis tells us that God only created.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 22:1, however, we see God and the Lamb which signifies that God is now the redeeming God, no longer merely the creating God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 1:1 He was the creating God, but in Revelation 22:1 we see the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 22:1 tells us that the throne is the throne of God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here it indicates that two are sitting on one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can two sit on one throne?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, God and the Lamb are not two, but they are coinhering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father John 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For eternity they are the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The green, jasper God is within the red, sardius Lamb Rev 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This redeeming God is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to look at this marvelous picture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here is a golden mountain twelve thousand stadia or approximately thirteen hundred and sixty-four miles high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the top of this high mountain is a throne and One is sitting on this throne who is both God and man, the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the source from which flows the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1977 a few of us brothers went to see the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day we drove to the north, to Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the foot of Mt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hermon, there is a fountain which is one of the three sources of the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a big spring that comes out of this fountain and the Jordan River flows out from this spring.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flow of the Jordan River comes from the spring, and the spring comes from the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a picture of the Triune God flowing Himself into His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The redeeming God is sitting on the throne with His sovereign authority as the very source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God the Father is the source, God the Son is the redeeming element, and the throne of God is the element of the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From this source flows the Spirit as the living water throughout the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we should have a living with the Father as the source of life on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must take the Godhead as our very source and as our very authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have already seen that we cannot throw the throne away and still enjoy the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must take the throne and be under the throne in order to have the enjoyment of the flowing life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we must see that we need to take God as our source with His redeeming element and with the element of His divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we do this, we have the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must have a living with the Father as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the source of our daily living, of our marriage life, of our home life, and of our church life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be able to tell ourselves, Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The source of my family life, marriage life, business life, and church life is God the Father with His redeeming element and with the element of His divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also live with the Father as love 1 John 4:8, 16 , the nature of God s essence, and as light 1 John 1:5 , the nature of God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the very divine life which flows from the divine source is love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only way that we could have such a living, taking God as the source of life, as love, the nature of His essence, and as light, the nature of His expression, is in the fellowship of His divine life 1 John 1:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must remain and keep ourselves in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to do this, we must have a definite, set aside time every day to stay with the Father in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This time should be at least five minutes long.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The longer your time is for this fellowship, though, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During this time, do not care for anything and lay aside every other burden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just have a time absolutely for you to contact the source of the divine life to remain in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to have such a time, you first have to practice to get everything done.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then gradually, you have to learn that you can still have this time of fellowship with many things undone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At first, if you have anything undone, your heart is always there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During your time of fellowship, your mind may wander to think about the things you have to do or bear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You have to improve yourself in this practice of remaining in the fellowship, however, until you advance into a state where you can be so free to remain with the Father for a set time with many things still undone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though there are many things around me that I see undone and that I feel compelled to do, I still set aside some time to enjoy the fellowship of the Father s divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must also learn during this set aside time to keep yourself in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After three or four minutes of having a time with the Lord, the telephone may ring.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let it ring.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You do not need to answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Learn to free yourself from outside disturbances to keep yourself in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Finally, you must learn to stop anything that you sense interrupts your fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Always try your best to keep yourself in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then you will enjoy God the Father as the source of life, as love, the nature of His essence, and as light, the nature of His expression.</S>
