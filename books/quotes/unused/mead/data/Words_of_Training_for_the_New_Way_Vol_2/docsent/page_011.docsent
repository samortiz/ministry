   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Subjective Aspect of Practice Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already covered the new way in the objective aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the subjective aspect of practice, the first item is preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every saved one is willing to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among us we paid attention to this matter from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in the recent ten years, from 1975 to 1984, we cannot deny that the effect of our gospel preaching was not that great.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We in the Lord s recovery must bear this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Increase in the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being at a Standstill for the Last Ten Years</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1949, the Lord s recovery went overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under my leadership, the recovery first reached Taiwan, then Southeast Asia, then Japan, and finally the Western world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I personally experienced and witnessed the spread of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By 1975, within twenty-six years, the number had increased considerably.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just take Taiwan as an example: the number increased from four or five hundred to over forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was exactly a one hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the ten-year period from 1975 to 1984, there was nearly no increase; the number was at a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I started working in the United States in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After thirteen years, the number had increased from one or two hundred to over ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the increase cannot be considered rapid, it was still somewhat comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in the last ten years, the number has hardly increased.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was first the situation of Taiwan, then that of the United States, which burdened me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning Canada, the brothers there have worked for nearly twenty years, but the number now is still not quite one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regarding Europe, there were originally only a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After 1971, some brothers went there, and the door of the Lord s recovery was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1984, of the number in all of Europe, Germany had the greatest number, followed by Switzerland and England.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then there were other countries including France, Italy, and Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The total number did not exceed eight hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning Australia and New Zealand, I went there in 1971.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By 1984, the total number of the two places was not more than three hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Speaking of Africa, as early as 1971, the brothers there had very good fellowship with us, and they began to have a testimony of the Lord in Ghana.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Up until now, they have already spread to five or six other countries in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The total number exceeds one thousand, but it is still not very satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In South America, only Brazil had some increase.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Up until 1984, the number was not more than two thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Central and South America, a total of more than twenty countries, the number still did not exceed ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I place this matter before you; if you had a genuine concern and foresight for the interest of the Lord s recovery, how would you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I saw this situation in 1984, I was already eighty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that I had received the Lord s special grace and mercy, that I had already reached the age of a strong person as spoken of in the Bible Psa 90:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may say that what I have now is an extra life given to me by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was contemplating the Lord s recovery on the earth, besides not knowing how to give account when I meet the Lord, I even felt that I could not give account to my former co-worker Brother Nee when I meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He had brought us this way and had rendered me the greatest help and a considerable commission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We had worked for so many years; yet, in spite of the fact that there are churches in the five continents, we are at a standstill as far as increase is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can this not distress me?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It does not make me happy to consider the United States; to think of Taiwan, my heart breaks.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I had labored here for over ten years, and had accumulated quite a spiritual heritage for so many who love the Lord; yet after you have worked here for twenty more years, you have come to such a result.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I returned three years ago, I came with an aching heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And as I considered North America, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, they were not an encouragement to me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not feel there is anything to be proud of at all; rather, I feel the time is late, and my remaining years are few.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We co-workers in every locality should all prostrate ourselves before the Lord, confess our uselessness, and also ask the Lord for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am one who is bearing a heavy burden, and one who speaks honestly and means business.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am not elevating myself nor am I proud.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am not deceiving myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to my knowledge, just in the Philippines and Singapore, there are some large congregations other than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Seoul, Korea alone, there is a congregation with a membership of a few hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although we have churches all over the different continents and countries, as far as the number is concerned, we have hardly anything worth talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, when I returned in 1984 to change the system, the main message was on the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This started the practice of gospel preaching by door-knocking.</S>
