   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two words in Genesis are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One is "subdue" in Genesis 1:28, which can also be translated "conquer."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The other is "keep" in Genesis 2:15, which can also be translated "guard."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We see from these verses that God ordained man to conquer and guard the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's original intention was to give the earth to man as a place to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was not His intention that the earth would become desolate Isa 45:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God desired, through man, to not allow Satan to intrude upon the earth, but the problem was that Satan was on earth and intended to do a work of destruction upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God wanted man to restore the earth from Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another matter we need to note is that God required man, strictly speaking, not only to take back the earth, but also the heaven which is related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Scripture there is a difference between "heavens" and "heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The "heavens" are where the throne of God is found, where God can exercise His authority, while "heaven" in the Scriptures sometimes refers to the heaven which is related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is this heaven which God also wants to recover see Rev 12:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may ask: Why doesn't God Himself cast Satan into the bottomless pit or the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our answer is: God can do it, but He does not want to do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not know why He will not do it Himself, but we do know how He is going to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants to use man to deal with His enemy, and He created man for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God wants the creature to deal with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He wants His creature man to deal with His fallen creature Satan in order to bring the earth back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The man whom He created is being used by Him for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us read Genesis 1:26 again: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth...."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems that the sentence is finished here, but another phrase is added: "...and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see that the creeping things occupy a very great position, for God spoke of it after He finished mentioning "all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The implication is that in order for man to have dominion over all the earth, the creeping things must not be overlooked, for God's enemy is embodied in the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The serpent in Genesis 3 and the scorpions in Luke 10 are creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only is there the serpent, representing Satan, but also scorpions, representing the sinful and unclean evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The domain of both the serpent and the scorpion is this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem is on the earth.</S>
