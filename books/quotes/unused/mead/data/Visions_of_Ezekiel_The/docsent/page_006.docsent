   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WIND, THE CLOUD, THE FIRE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE ELECTRUM Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:4; Psa 75:6, 7a; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>37:9; John 3:8; Acts 2:2, 4a; Exo 24:16a; 40:34; Deut 4:24; Heb 12:29; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1:27a, 28; 8:2b, 4; Rev 4:3a; 22:1 FOUR MAIN THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ezekiel 1:4 covers four main things: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is a book full of pictures revealing to us God and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because God is Spirit, He is very abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without a picture, it would be rather difficult for us to understand God and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible uses many types, figures, and pictures to describe and portray to us the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Ezekiel is especially a book of pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The visions Ezekiel saw were absolutely related to God and to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the figures and pictures, the invisible, spiritual things become visible to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter one of Ezekiel has many figures and pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse four alone covers four figures: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The picture in this one verse is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us consider these figures in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE STORMY WIND From the North</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First of all, the wind came from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did the wind come from the north, and not from the south, or from the east, or from the west?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The answer is in Psalm 75.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There it says that the lifting up, the promotion, comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south, but that God judges.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does this prove?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that God is at the north.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in geographical terms the north is always up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>North is not down; north is up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, God is always up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are going north, we say we are going up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that when we are going north we are going to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The wind from the north means that the wind came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is the source of this wind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The dwelling place, the habitation of God, is the very source of all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wind came from the north, from the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Signifying the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Hebrew word for wind is ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ruach may be translated wind, breath, or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the King James Version, this same Hebrew word, ruach, is translated into all three of these words in Ezekiel 37.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 9 of that chapter, ruach is translated into wind; in verses 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, ruach is translated into breath; and in verses 1 and 14, ruach is translated into Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is very difficult for the translators to decide whether in a certain verse it means the wind, the breath, or the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The decision must be made according to the context.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ruach, which in 1:4 is translated into wind, is nothing less than the powerful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not just a wind, but a stormy wind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the day of Pentecost there was a rushing, mighty wind which filled the house where they were sitting Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No doubt the mighty, rushing wind is just the powerful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 3:8, the Lord Jesus said, "the wind blows..."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some versions point out in their footnote that this word wind is translated from the Greek word pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Hebrew word ruach is exactly the same as the Greek word pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Pneuma is also translated into wind, breath, or spirit, depending on the context of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, what the Lord Jesus said may also be translated as "the Spirit blows..."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Ezekiel 1, the wind is a figure, a picture of the mighty Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not a weak wind, but a strong, stormy wind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All our spiritual experiences always start with a spiritual storm.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even when you were saved, there was a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps you were a student who was caring for nothing but studying, playing, and simply going to school.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But one day a storm came to you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A stormy wind blew upon you and turned you upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This caused you to consider: "What is the meaning of human life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Where did I come from?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Where shall I go?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This was the blowing of the stormy wind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Surely all the saved ones experienced a storm at their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can never forget the storm that I experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was a young man under twenty years of age and full of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I was studying hard in order to have a good future.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But one day I listened to a gospel message and a stormy wind blew upon me and turned me upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Didn't you also have such a storm?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether you are young or old, you all had such a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not only at the time of our salvation, but also even after we were saved we had many storms.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some of the dear ones in the local churches were missionaries on the mission field or Christian workers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One day a storm came and turned everything upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This caused them to seek the Lord desperately and eventually to come into the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only at our conversion, but at every turn of our spiritual life a storm comes to us from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not bad it is really grace to have a storm coming from God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is a God who gives us the storms.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many storms come to us from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I cannot tell you how many storms I have received.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Every storm is worthwhile to recall.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I do believe that when we are in eternity, we will recall the storms.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The storms will be a pleasant remembrance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As we follow the Lord, many storms will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The stormy wind is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He blows upon us to bring a storm into our life, into our work, and into our church.</S>
