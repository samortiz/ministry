   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If you will work on the groups according to what I have told you, I can guarantee you that bit by bit, like a little stream that flows steadily, our number will double every year.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You will continuously have new ones added to you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Generation after generation, everyone will be nourished and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this way, we will truly be the refined and educated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that in a few years such a situation will be seen among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the revelation in the New Testament, the practice of the new way sometimes requires the help of the apostles and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They conduct conferences and trainings in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can see this in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He conducted a long-term training in Ephesus, admonishing and teaching people for two to three years Acts 19:8-10; 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After this, he went to Troas, where he stayed for seven days and held a special conference Acts 20:6-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, from 1986 until now we have had full-time trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition to this, it would be to the further advantage of a big church like the church in Taipei to have conferences once a month to release timely messages, "blow the trumpet," and motivate the whole church to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these cannot be accomplished by the small meetings and are also needed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I returned this time, I felt happier than the last time because, according to my observation, all the local churches here have made progress.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, I wanted once again to review with you the way to preach the gospel, to feed the lambs, and to have the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What I have fellowshipped with you is sufficient for you to take back to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would ask that after you go back to your locality, you would fully carry this out step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should not try to practice it in a general way; that will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must definitely take the lead to do it, and you must make sure that the brothers and sisters are doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way, you will have a bright future ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LEARNING TWO LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, I hope that you all can learn two lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In whatever you do, you have to look to the Lord from deep within, saying, "Lord, I am merely a channel and a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without You, whatever I do is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without Your blessing, whatever I do will come to nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to have this kind of spirit and should pray this way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is another important lesson which we must not forget: regardless of which church, hall, or district we are in, we are all one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must keep the oneness of the Spirit and must be in harmony one with another, loving one another, learning from one another, and helping one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think that we are doing well and despise others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither should we be jealous because others are doing better.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these things should not be within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If possible, we should go to one another to observe and to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do your best to learn whatever can be learned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do your best to teach others in whatever way you can help them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even the people in the world have such an exchange all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should have this all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must also understand that regardless of how careful you are and how much you love one another, no two persons will conduct their work exactly alike.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, you need to avoid opinions, criticisms, and confrontations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need only to do your best to learn and to do your best to work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You do not need to wait three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe by this time next year you will have much improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In one year you can make much progress.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord be merciful to you.</S>
